Do you think it would be possible to file a class action lawsuit towards blizzard?,"Not saying I will. I was just thinking about it and was wondering how others felt about it.

I paid $60 for a game that was good, and worked and I enjoyed, only for them to take that away completely and replace it with an objectively inferior product that didn't even have all the promised features in the first place. They couldn't even keep the product I paid for running along side the new product that is now free for everyone. And something about that feels really really scummy.

Just had a support throw three seperate games because they were complaining about other teammates,"First game on the opposite team, they threw by not participating and leaving the team 1 support down.
 Next game, they were on my team, within the first minute, they complained about my healing and said they would do the same as last game if I didnt do more. They then proceeded to throw in the same way.
 About an hour later, I'm in another game first round is a back and forth but my team takes it in the end. Second round I see the enemy team type in chat ""healers are throwing"" then the same support who threw the other games chimes in ""i cant contoll the useless tank"".

A Discussion about support and Damage,"I hope the title is done in the best of my ability and knowledge cause it about me as a support 
But also me talking about the team who pick damages. New time posting so if I get anything wrong I full heartedly agree if the post needs to be taken down 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello! I have been playing overwatch sense about 2017 and I have come across this couple of times but I’m not fully understanding why people get so mad about it. I’m in a match and at the start I played as Illari, we were winning until a Sombra showed up and would never go after my damage just me, my other support did nothing the first round. So I switched to Moira to help combat not only the Sombra but also help combat the tank MAUGA on the enemy team.
 We won the first round and I had about 15 kills, the end of the second round I had ask my dps if they could like, help me get rid of the Sombra so I can focus more of my healing and not have to play dps Moira all the time. They didn’t respond so I took it as maybe they would help me. The enemy had taken the point until 85% and when I asked them, “ if you can’t play Hanzo or junkrat  may you please switch off I have a really good winning streak and I don’t want to loose it."" they had 5 and 8 kills the whole three rounds. 
i had 24 as Moira and Illari. they start completely going off the rails and even the zenyatta yelling and cussing at me for just asking them if they could switch cause i had 8,789 Damage and 5,134 healing cause anytime i would get to them when they were critical, they would already be dead by the enemy team, and when I were with them, they would already be full of health. they started screaming at me that I wasn't doing healing, but how am I supposed to heal when the DPS are really doing anything which makes me have to be DPS for them and then they want to cuss me out when i'm not healing them because not only does Moira healing is small but because i keep dying to the sombra i cant help that i'm not there every second of the round for them. 

So when I’m basically trying to ask is why does DPS get so mad at support for asking them to take care of a character that is having a hard time for the support to be supports and why can’t I asked them if you don’t know how to play Hanzo or junk rat ( both two dps were playing these two characters) or you’re not very good at it and I’m having to do both which I shouldn’t have because you chose to play DPS in role pick, why are they going to scream and cuss me out if honestly I ask them nicely and I think it unfair for me to do both and then get yelled at for pointing out my frustration. I understand overwatch is just for fun but if it’s for fun, why am I having to stress out taking care of this team if they’re going to yell at me for just asking them to switch. 

There’s other characters you can play there’s over 37 characters that you can play that you could do well at and if you just wanna have fun, you could just go into AI I’m just overall confused of why I got yelled at. 
And if there’s any other way I could get tips on how to ask Team Mate to switch without sounding rude, which I wasn’t rude, but they were men and just flip the chats that woman was asking them to change.

This is not to be hating on anyone or I don’t wanna arguments in the comments about if I was wrong or if they were wrong I am just wondering like what am I supposed to do in the situation to make it better for not only my team, but also if I come across this again.",Overwatch,1706040312.0,t3_19dxjdt

What If Efi Was A Hero? | Hero Concept,"Name:  Efi Oladele (Orisa’s creator)

Role: Support

Health: 125 health, 75 shields



Primary Fire: Wrench throw 
Throw a projectile wrench with a big hit box that deals increased damage to armor. (1 ammo.)



Secondary Fire: Energy Wave
Use an old OR15 hand to blast a healing wave. This wave heals less the more it travels. (70-50 healing based on distance. 5 ammo. Pierces through teammates.)



Ability 1: Override Net
Throw a net that can attach up to three enemies in the area hit. This net makes it so any damage dealt to anyone in the net is also shared to the other enemies in the net. (Lasts 5 seconds. Shared damage is reduced by 45%)



Ability 2: Glitch Sphere
Send out a holographic sphere that pulls enemies to the center of it. (Orisa’s old halt ability.)



Ultimate: Fire Wall
Create a big glowing shield, that deflects every enemy projectile for 8 seconds. (No damage can go through this shield. Indestructible.)



Passive: Anti-Virus
When one of Efi’s cooldowns are on cooldown, she gains a 10% speed boost. When both abilities are on cooldown, she gains a 15% speed boost.

My brother in christ, there is no amount of healing that will save you from dying while repeeking the same angle and standing there for too long.

And then simply getting people to group the fuck up. You're not going to go super saiyan and get a lucky potshot on the mercy from 50m away as a soldier. You're not helping by sprinting ahead and peeking a character that can one shot you while the rest of us are coming out of spawn. So many different situations...

Even after reports, I changed my way of communication avoiding saying bad words and changing everything in general, and still, I got muted for 13 days, I wonder why?

Are DPS players just cosmetic in this game or do you just get bots after a few rounds.,Idk Lately if I play any other roll than dps my dps are good for like 3 matches and then the next 5 they go like 2-9 and one even went 3-17. They blamed supports and tank of course even tho they had 14k+16k healing done that match from their supports which is far more than the other team. The Tank didn't seem that bad either because he outlasted them every time but because nobody was dying he would eventually have to back up or die. Seems like the ranking system likes to humble you if you seem to be on any kind of winning streak and if you aren't prepared to take over as the dps in other rolls your as good as done.  ,Overwatch,1706024310.0,t3_19dr5v7

Support Achievements Question,"Hey so I had a quick question about some of the support achievements regarding specific characters.  I really enjoy and want to get even better at some of the supports, but I am having a very difficult time obtaining some of them on specific characters and it makes me think that not being able to get them kind of means I'm just not good at them or not playing them right at all.  Specifically lifeweaver for instance.  I feel like I do fairly well with using his entire kit, healing and doing alright damage every game, making a few saves here and there or repositioning someone out of an ult or etc.  but I just can't seem to get 3 saves in 1 life or the X amount of healing with 1 tree.  This also goes for lucio and his 3 kills while wall riding.  I know people say just boop off 3 people then wall ride before they die but I feel like that is really hard to get, esp after they see im lucio and stay a mile away from a ledge.

I just want to know is it normal to take a long time to get these, and should it discourage me from playing them in that I might possibly not be playing them correctly if I can't get their achievements?

Edit: Also, I seem to get really wrapped up in the post game stats that are attached to a character and feel like if I'm not raising them all decent then I'm not playing them right either.

Just started playing OW after 4 years away,"I played comp placements and landed in gold. Every game we lose first fight, the whole team just starts being nasty and blaming.

I tried to encourage positivity but both teams started flaming me as healer. I had most healing in match. I don't understand. I play other games that are notorious for bad communities, but OW2 takes the cake no contest. 

People should not be freaking out this much over gold lobbies. I understand as a team based game you will lose frequently even though you play great, and I won't be putting my best foot forward every game, but I get several matches where it seems like half my team is already on full tilt before we've made it 30 seconds into the match.

There were discussions on the playerbase back when I started OW in 2016, its by no contest far worse now. Downvote me all you want but this game is made unenjoyable by a lot of the people that play it. I used to love OW but the experience now is just miserable. ",Overwatch,1706009489.0,t3_19dmdoy

Just tried the assault maps for the first time. I'm a fan.,"Got tired of playing mystery heroes in my down time so I switched to assault maps on arcade. I have a few things to say about it.

I can see why this game mode is both hated and loved. The maps are beautiful. There are plenty of team fights. There's a bunch of action and room for playmaking. And the objective is simple. You either cap the point or stop the enemy from capping. There's no need to worry about keeping the robot a certain distance from the enemy spawn, or how many people you keep on the payload and how many will push up. You don't get your rhythm messed up in between different maps. You just have one simple thing to do in this mode. 

I despise open queue and have had some of my favorite matches playing assault. I finally see why so many people want Hanamura back. Winning a nice back and forth game on attack feels *so* good - which brings me to my next point. 

Like many opinions that I've read about the mode, I'd have to agree that the map favors the defenders. The game has for some reason decided to put me on the defenders side about 80% of my matches. It's so easy to defend on these maps if you have a good comp. The spawn advantage on second point is ridiculous. I can't even imagine playing this mode in competitive where every single round goes into overtime. 

Overall, I'd want 2cp back in role queue. It'd probably become my favorite game mode.",Overwatch,1705986359.0,t3_19dgnqq

Who is the least smartest character lore wise?,"I say Ashe. Ashe has a gang and an omnic butler, still loses to one guy who is literally holding back from killing them. Meanwhile Ashe is completely filled with bloodlust on wanting him dead.

Cassidy uses his surroundings to his advantage (e.g using falling boulders as a cover while reposition). Ashe continues mindlessly standing in the wide open even after she got stunned by a flashbang and nearly got shot. 

Ashe has better numbers and arsenal but she still utilizes poorly. Like she could have sent BOB to grab Cassidy while everyone provides suppressing fire, Ashe also can use dynamite to blow up Cassidy or force him out of cover.

Ashe also didn't learn anything from her defeat. Her greediness actually led to her downfall that she could have gone home with plenty of spoils in exchange of letting Cassidy and Echo walk free, but now she goes home empty handed (plus losing a bike).

Support rework ideas for fun pt2,"Title, This is the second half of my ideas, which I wrote out because i was bored. 

Aimed at balancing characters around how annoying they can be to deal with more than their actual impact. 


Kiriko:

Headshot damage dropped to 90. 

TP cooldown bumped to 8 seconds. 

I got nothing for Suzu. It's annoying but it's also not horribly imbalanced imo, it together with everything else is the problem to me, and I play Ana predominantly, so I'm used to getting cleansed but eh, that's fair enough. It's a bit needed atm to deal with insanely high burst damage.

Reasonings: Yes yes I get it, high skill ceiling for aim. However, more often than not this kills you through ranged random spam. 140 damage on a single spammed support Character is NUTS. 90 means you don't get double dinked by lucky spam halfway across the map but still take enough damage to get the message and fuck off. If she lands 3, you're either really unlucky or you over stayed your welcome. 
In a close up duel, It would be 2 head taps and a melee or a body shot. That's fair imo. Even as a support main I feel like kirikos damage output is just way too high for someone as survivable as she is. Lucio is hella survivable but he needs either a perfect 4 hit burst to match her damage or a combo. She's more survivable than he is at times and can consistently just out damage him on pure luck.

It should take SOMETHING more than hoping two headshots connect, and on players that actually do have good aim, she's more dangerous than many DPS are at times. Pretty much everyone she fights has to land ALOT of shots to kill her, but she only has to land 2, can invuln for a second to dodge big cooldowns, heals a burst of 80hp, and after 6 seconds can just vanish. Half the time you are fighting her she's tp'd in with a flanker and only has to land one shot for the flanker to confirm your death.

Its a bit much imo and I don't think these changes would be a massive reduction to her effectiveness, but it would make her less annoying and less able to do things that are a bit dumb. 


Ana:

Split sleep and Anti into two charges, each at half duration (and damage in antis case, though I would love to see the chaos of full damage double antis lmao) 

Reasoning:

The anti point has been made before, people dislike it. I as an Ana player don't really agree that it's a source of an issue, but a symptom. 
However, I can agree that 3 whole seconds where possibly no one can be healed is an issue at times. 
With how much burst damage and healing is in the game, I do think it's needed to keep some of that in check, but sure, 3 seconds on one throw is probably a bit much. 1.5 seconds gives your team a good shot at either confirming a kill or making a sizeable dent in their HP so the other team struggles a bit more to heal it up and landing the second means you can continue that, or give someone else an issue to deal with.

With sleep, this moves it somewhat closer to being an interrupt rather than a hard stun. Sleep being a high skill to hit thing I think its pretty fair as is right now, but it would be nice to have two for various situations even at half effectiveness. 

It also kinda helps a bit with dealing with various situations, and it gives you a chance to correct a mistake someone makes in waking someone up when you've just hit them. 
 

Mercy: Rez revives at 20%HP. If you want to rez at a higher HP level, you MUST commit to more time spent holding the cast. 80% is the max, takes 3 seconds to reach full charge. LOS breaking disables the cast. 

Damage boost can be applied for 5 seconds and then it swaps to healing. Cannot apply damage boost to the same target for another 5 seconds. If you flick between dmg boost and healing, it locks you out for however long that damage boost was applied. I.E, 2 sec boost, 2 sec cooldown on that character. 5 secs is your maximum at a time. 

Sympathetic healing is disabled.

GA time increased to 4 seconds, GA burst heals her for 40hp. Jumping from GA sends you 25% further.

Reasoning: 
Mercy was my first character in 2017. I learnt the game with her and I think she's a fantastic character with a higher skill ceiling than people give her credit for. That being said, she enables braindead gameplay way too much. I play her and love doing it, yet I also watch other mercys and regularly think ""How do you get away with something as dumb as that?""

Rez is a problem but I don't feel it's conceptually broken just executed poorly. 
If you want to quickly dart in and rez in a risky situation your team should be required to cover for you. This is rarely the case. More often than not she can just hold that Button down and revive as soon as you die or fly straight to someone and rez them without much risk. 

These changes make it so that she CAN pick someone up immediately, but she MUST provide support to that person instead of just fucking off again and having a full HP, likely full cooldown character back in play for free.
Again, your team should have to cover for a rez, not just expect and get it for nothing.
If you want to bring someone back at a higher amount of HP, again you have to cover her longer. 
Mercy should have to think about this properly. If someone dies, a mistake was made, you shouldn't get a blank slate for a mistake. 

Damage boost timer and lock out is to prevent pocketing someone with damage boost indefinitely.  

Properly cycling damage and heals is how you play mercy well, but you still get insane value for just doing one or the other, this stops that and encourages you to play her in the way that is optimal, it's both a restriction on her most annoying method of play, and a semi enforced teaching tool to teach mercy players how to rotate their damage boost between players and not just to focus on pockets. 

Sympathetic healing, is dumb. It's lifesteal from moira but through healing onto a team mate and it makes killing a Mercy extremely tedious, I disagree with its existence. 

GA cooldown encourages a mercy to be more selective with it, and to position better in general so shes in less danger but can heal people more readily, it should be a commitment to fly to someone and help them. Again, a learning tool baked into her design. The GA jump distance boost is to let you position more creatively or nope out of a bad GA a bit better. 

The GA health boost helps compensate for the drop in survivability, if you dont interrupt her healing after she has GA'd, her passive will kick in. 

So you have more time to kill her in general after she has used GA but if she's escaping she does have a better chance of survival.",Overwatch,1705967178.0,t3_19da8j3

Support Character rework ideas for fun pt 1,"Title, this is cuz I'm bored but would also like to see them. Most of these aren't aimed at massively changing the balance but are aimed at making said characters less annoying, with the first character being an exception, I just want that change personally. 

Split into two parts for length. Part 2- ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/s/MAtkw9RZ41 )

Lucio: 

When on healing aura, booping team mates burst heals them for 40hp. Speed aura gives them a 1 second speed boost (speed boost % doesnt stack with aura)

Boop takes your movement direction into account and pushes you in that direction a small bit. Like a minor dash of a couple meters.(this one really is for fun only. Would give his mobility a bit of extra flair.) 

Reasoning:
Nice bit of extra healing, let's you give particular team mates the ability to chase a bit more or get away further, while being able to continue healing, more decisions to make for lucio when helping team mates. 




Moira:

Primary fire(I always refer to the damage as primary fire) doesn't life steal
   It's honestly kinda dumb, I play alotta Moira when I want to swap between large amounts of healing in tight knit comps or flex out to help kill the backline or defend my other support, her lifesteal plus the auto accuracy really isn't something she should have on Primary fire.

When I'm fighting a moira one on one I'll literally stand still and just focus on my aim if I Don't have an easy escape, zero point in trying to dodge her shots so I might as well make aiming easier on myself.

Orb:
  Remove the bouncing around. Moira picks a spot, same way Ram shield works, and the Orb flies to that spot (Tagging anyone along the way for health or damage) and hovers there until its either expended its payload, or 5 seconds have passed. Orb damage has life steal (Not multiplicative of how many are being damaged)

Reasonings: Skill orb is a long standing meme, and it's annoying, both to use and face. 

If you're using it, you almost always only get some of the benefit of it unless you're tossing it right into the middle of a massive group of heavily damaged team mates or enemies. Otherwise it just passes by and then vanishes into narnia unless you're doing something niche like bouncing it straight up into the ceiling, which is funny but overall not that helpful. If you're facing it then it's basically a coin toss on it flying away after the first pass or chasing you down like a vengeful spirit and killing you through sheer luck.

Picking where it stops means you can do things like block flanks, cut off a retreat, deny an area, or with healing you can give it to a dedicated team mate, give your whole team a temp healing turret and stuff like that. I'd infinitely prefer this over the chaotic skill orb we have. More options, less random bullshit.
Giving it the lifesteal means she can retain the same extra survivability lifesteal gives her but it's not just about being within 20 meters of her now, it's about being within a few meters of the orb. Helps her a bit but also stops the whole braindead jumping into the backline because she WILL just survive until the fade cooldown is over. You can move and position a bit more with her abilities in mind.",Overwatch,1705967036.0,t3_19da6iv

If I play damage and my Elims are low even though I’m actually getting solo kills as early picks, I’m immediately bad because of it. It’s especially bad because they don’t show more detailed stats, like showing healing prevented by Ana nade or players saved, and things like Lucio speed boost are basically not accounted for at all.

Absolutely broken matchmaking in dia and the real hell of playing solo in group of 4.,"

Hello, i am an phlegmatic person but everyday i get mad with this game but usually i keep my pain in my head... today i almost lost it and smash up my pc...I play solo dps as always.  


Every day hard grinding solo hell... First game we got toxic feeding zarya, next game we have feeding widow who left and now the worst of the worst: Another match, we got diffed so much, other dps were negative kd, so between round i checked and see that they are in group, ask them if they are in one group and yes...checked the profile of other dps and boom GOLD 5...GOLD 5 in DIA match wow wow wow.   
I ask them why are they boosting him and ofc all toxic, but the problem is blizzard not them...Is this game dying? Or why they even create this caricature of competitive matches?  


I grind everyday, its so hard to play solo, also i have to play soldier or sombra or similar self-sustainable heroes to not be expecting in some kind of teamplay but what is this...ofc you can see sure its just one bad game...no its getting worse and worse...all the time toxic, one trick...i thought it will be different in diamand but tough luck. I would rather wait 10 - 15 minutes for matchmaking for 5 solo vs 5 solo than this shit.  


HM2SKY -  i was soldier, then sombra...ofc i threw and did some mistakes after realizing we are done...have fun and dont forget to write me, it was totally my fault, not the plat tank or that GOLD 5 dps (iiiiiii know its not his fault, its blizzards, but still. i told him to play counter hanzo at least..ofc he did not go anything usefull). if this was 5 SOLO VS 5 SOLO i would not get that mad, but this is just BS, big blizzard bs, that deserver another negative review on steam, yuck.

reporting system," 

The current reporting system in Overwatch 2 appears to be experiencing issues and requires significant improvement. Users are encountering account losses, some of which they have held for several years, due to seemingly innocuous statements such as expressing a preference for a specific hero or requesting role swaps. There is also concern about the occurrence of troll banning in stacks, where a group of players reports an individual who is performing well, resulting in an automatic AI ban.

Even casual comments like “Pharah, you like that headshot” during gameplay have reportedly led to bans, with the AI system flagging such interactions. The consequences extend beyond mere account suspension, as users are losing valuable in-game assets, including skins, amounting to significant financial losses. The absence of human review by game masters exacerbates the situation, as all bans are currently handled by AI without providing adequate explanations upon request.

The lack of transparency in the ban process, coupled with the absence of clear reasons for bans, raises concerns among the community. While it is understandable that severe violations, such as homophobic or racist behavior, should warrant strict consequences, the current system lacks a nuanced approach. Users are calling for a more balanced and transparent review process, urging developers to address these issues promptly and comprehensively.",Overwatch,1705948814.0,t3_19d2ttw

"All ""impossible"" support mechanics explained and simpified.","I'm sick of seeing people's saying that OW is just a world of magic and that support's skills make no sense. I may not have a degree in science or any experience in tech.

So let's get through this:

Lucio - obviously his healing isn't ""just music."" It's most likely minute nanobots that are able to enter in one's body through his or her ears and make the necessary repairs. That's also why his healing is slow and have a limited range: it's based on his weapon (the HQ device). Speed boost is the same: it enters the body to strengthen the legs and cardio.

Mercy - people say Dmg boost makes no sense. Some said that it is an enhance for the body, but this doesn't explain why projectiles like bullets are affected by it. The reality is that Mercy's blue beam casts a barrier around the body. Anything that pierces the barrier takes on an elctro-effect that strengthens it. This accounts for all attacks. 

Rez and healing would be similar. Since OW characters don't get mortally wounded, we can assume that an HP bar is only representative of their heart and when their heart gives out. Rez is simply a super-charged electric shock to reawaken the heart. 

Baptiste - his is similar to Mercy's. It doesn't ""negate dying""; it provides a barrier that repels attacks. 

Kiriko - It is more likely that Kiriko's tailsmen are actually just robotic healing-aids. We can see this in the animatic short: when she places on the old dude, it lights up and heals him. Also, her ult performs similar to lucio's, in a sense that it ""enters"" the body as a stimulant. This falls in line with Overwatch's universe's logic and explain why it wouldn't work for enemy's: Kiriko employed a special code so that it is only activated for her teammates. You might say that suzu works the same way, but it is actually realistic that suzu is just an ancient formula passed down from tradition.

Lifeweaver: how can a plant HEAL? Obviously, it functions as a repair station, where the waves emitted from the tree repairs the body.

Ana - why do some of ana's bullets heals and others heart? This is clearly because it's a smart gun: when the scop passes a target, it scans the enemy. Ana places codes on her teammates, and anyone without the code gets hurt. You may be thinking why her grenade, for that matter, can splatter both enemies and teammates at the same time. The answer is simple: it's a smart grenade. The liquid contains two states. Once it is on a person without the code, it activates a poison (the dmg for the poison negates healing) and activates a healing agent that accelerates repair functions for teammates.

Zen - don't listen to any of that magic nonsense. Zen's discords are very simple: yellow orb is a host of bots that enter the body to make repairs; purple orb is a host of bots that dispels the body's defense mechanisms, causing more weakness. 

Brig - Now HOW can HITTING someone heal? It's actually pretty simple. when the flail makes contact, it expels a healing agent that immediately seeks her teammates. The friction and energy from bashing would power the flail here so she can use it infinitely without worrying about ""charging"" the device. That's why she has to hit things.

so yeah like I said OW is not ""magic""; everything has a purpose.",Overwatch,1705948249.0,t3_19d2l8i

I hope season 9 is the beginning of big yearly updates to freshen things up,"Big balance changes, new heroes and reworks, new maps and updates to existing maps, new game modes and updates to existing game modes, battlepass improvements, new and easier ways to get and earn cosmetics, and bringing back limited time competitive modes like mystery heroes or (hot take) 2cp.

Also bringing back some old features like LFG and the general player levels. I like the new progression system but I think it just needs better icons, but there's no reason not to have general player levels from OW1 with the player border and the more indepth hero and role progression systems together. Maybe even a clan like system?

I hope Overwatch does something similar to how league of legends has yearly seasons.

Blizzard has an opportunity with season 9 to start a new year with the new matchmaking system and soft MMR reset combined with upcoming passive updates and many balance changes. It's one way to keep the game fresh and fun.

I know Blizzard has a longer timeline for the game that we don't know about, and that's okay but I thought I'd throw out some ideas to see what other people think and see if there's any worthwhile discussion around it.

Also pls just straight up delete souvenirs from the game.

Edit: Since I've been playing The Finals a bit, they have a tournament game mode where you basically play 3 matches with the final 2 teams playing against each other. I think a solo / duo queue mode  where you do something similar could be fun to find a random team and try to win the tournament over 3 matches.",Overwatch,1705940429.0,t3_19czdkh

From bronze to plat Ball experience,"After playing since launch being bronze my role career, I decided one day that I was going to get good. I always loved ball so I thought I'd use him. That, and he does pretty well without relying on his team so much.

I understand that the play experience is so much better with the chat turned off. If I turned it off, I wouldn't have seen the difference of reactions. I'm still climbing and pretty steadily.

At first, the chat reactions were flaming me because I chose ball. Before I started gaining the level of expertise with ball I have now, it was pretty hit or miss how the team would react. Primarily it was negative. 

As I started getting better and started getting win streaks, my confidence rose and my gameplay got better and better. I'm not actually at Platinum yet but I'm about to hit it for the first time. I haven't played in about a week and jumped on before I started my day. I played 4 games and won 4 games. It is extremely rewarding hearing my team congratulate me on actually playing ball well. With balls reputation as the worst tank in the game, I like this versus how it used to be when I just sucked.

What is funny now is now I get the opposing team chat coming in about how the ball player has no life or doesn't shower LOL. I think this is just funny. As ball, I love to fire back against toxicity with positivity because it it's a kind of troll move if you think about it.  It also earns me more endorsements. 

For once in my overwatch career, I'm doing pretty well.",Overwatch,1705933006.0,t3_19cwm0x

I really think it’d be cool if we got a character inspired by Dante from DMC.,"A weapon swapper who is a master of movement and can adapt himself to various scenarios sounds awesome.

Tanks are not the leader of a team,I notice a lot of the time that teams tend to gather around their tank even they’re not performing well. And tanks themselves except their team to be behind them at all time. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve  noticed the tank leading their team to defeat whether that’s being stuck at a choke or not using multiple routes to get to the objective. Instead of the other 4 players taking autonomy and making plays to make it easier for the team they just stand and shoot where their tank is not contributing whatsoever to their victory. And honestly it’s frustrating when you want to tell your teammates that they should follow you or at least spread out just because most players are more inclined to follow rather than lead or at least play their own game.

What am I supposed to do I love ow but these queues are horrible it's just not a fun experience if nothing is dying and it ends up with everyone on my team having 3-4 kills while the enemy has 30+ how do I have fun on a game I love if this is how every match keeps going",Overwatch,1705886902.0,t3_19cjpza

What are you guys' thoughts on the patch notes released on January 9th?,I made a video on this specific set of patch notes and my reactions to it but i wanted to hear the subreddits thoughts as well before i reupload my video tomorrow evening.,Overwatch,1705885671.0,t3_19cjamc
Do you think roles have lost their identities?,"I was watching a video from an OW content creator about the next changes on S9 (the DPS and Tank self healing), and while writing a reply that thought crossed my mind.

Supports passed from giving some kind of utility (movement, damage, making easier to kill enemies, heal block, etc) to be healing machines that can easily duel other heroes; having abilities that are broken or useless depending on the patch, and in general, not giving to your team more than a small gimmick. I mean, I understand you either be able to defend yourself or die, but then what's the point of being a support just because you can heal if heroes like Hanzo or Sombra can support better the team than you. We became so dependant on healing that, in ranks under master (were almost all of players are), supports can't do nothing but healing because either their team dies or they report them for not being useful enough or the other case, supports are so busted you can't destroy a team without giving more to your team than kills.

Tanks passed from crowd-control and taking space from their team to be dps with huge health pools that either they're unkillable killing machines or they're useless because they don't have the tools a DPS has to escape or kill. And now that there's only one tank, tank play summarizes in counterplaying the other tank rather than trying to enable your teammates to do their stuff.

Even DPS have been hit hard because they're supposed to secure kills, but they have lost the tools to do that via burst damage being nerfed and healing being so busted, and the other roles being able to kill as much as a dps can. The ones that are viable is because ironically, they have support tools and/or reliable ways to kill. 

I have to say, I've been playing since year 2 of OW1, and at that time, I was mainly a tank player (now I only play support), and while I can understand a lot of people prefer the way the game is now, I miss the times playing a role implied you had to commit to play in a way that maybe makes you don't kill that much but enabling your teammates to shine.

How do comp points per rank work??,"I'm seeing a ton of different things on the internet about how comp points work.  I know it's 25 per win and i think 15 per draw, but how many comp points do you get per rank at the end of the season? I just got back into playing recently and I remember a long time ago you would get comp points cumulitive to the ranks you got for all 3 roles. So lets say I got plat for tank, DPS, and support I would get the comp points for plat x3. Does it work the same or is it different now?",Overwatch,1705883928.0,t3_19ciomr

3 tank 2 Support is why we open que rank doesnt work,"Playing against this kind of comp in Arcade just kind of ruins the QP nature of it for me.

Because it has all the problems of double shield with tanks that are built to last on their own, especially with ones like Mauga, Queen, Orisa or Sigma.

Idk, I just felt like venting my thoughts because I wasnt in OW for the GOATS meta, but this feels VERY close.",Overwatch,1705883366.0,t3_19cihl5
What is it about Overwatch that makes close matches impossible?,"I have played many PvP games of various genres.

Anyone know how the open queue ranked system works ?,"Recently my friends and I decided that it could be funny to play open queue ranked. To put to perspective we are metal rank players in role queue somewhere around silver and gold. 

First game we are gold 1, so we don't mind then we go plat even though we lost in gold. And for some reason the more we played the higher the rank was. We got from gold 1 games to games going as high as diamond 5. And the worst part is that we got our asses clapped in those games we were powerless. 

And still after 14 games with a 5-9 ratio with 1 gold game 3 diamond games and the rest being plat games I ended up diamond 5 with one of my friends the other being plat 1. And two others not having enough wins (we didn't always played with each other) 

I mean I'm grateful for the free competitive points but I'm really confused. Keep in mind it was our first time playing in open queue ranked. And we're not supposed to be that high. 

So I was wondering if anyone knew what's going on here",Overwatch,1705879101.0,t3_19cgxko
A design for a Dominican Tank named ‘Vera’ I made. Tell me what you think!,"Vera is designed to be a more lightweight dive/brawl tank, getting in an out of fights simply but strategically and dealing high and consistent values of damage.

From a visual design point, the image in the post is a simple group of them I put together. He is designed to resemble a character within the show ‘mr robot’ known as ‘Vera’ who I’ve always loved so I supposed this is a sort of passion project in that regard. He is physically leaner and smaller than the other tanks, however his large cannon makes up the majority of his physicality. He is muscular and has los muertos patterning all over him, of which glow brighter in dark areas.

His background and backstory is interesting and unique, especially his interactions with Sombra of which he has an obsessive admiration over, although Sombra while emotional is intelligent enough to overcome his manipulative nature. He is a Dominican refugee who immigrated to Mexico after being forced out of his home by the Omnic crisis. He founded the Los Muertos gang which saw widespread interest from many orphaned Mexicans and victims of the omnic crisis who were vengeful of those responsible, causing it to rapidly grow. He took in Sombra as one of his closest and most valuable members, giving her things such as food, shelter and even a stuffed bear to gain her trust. Vera took advantage of Sombra and her skills, leaving Sombra with paranoia and a hatred towards Vera when she joined talon. Vera encourages Sombra to join back due to how much she provided for the gang, however both of them know the answer will always be never. Vera is very emotional and also mentally fragile and unstable which we see in his voice lines. He is also remorseless when killing the rest of the cast in game (except Sombra) especially towards omnics and talon members 

From a gameplay perspective, Vera is good at poking out single targets from range, but shines at rapidly diving enemies and strategically setting up shock mines around the map in order to move around easier. Reflective of his personality, Vera very much plays like a glass cannon, dealing consistent and high damage but relying on movement and one ability to get out of situations. His ultimate is best used for area denial or finishing off small groups of squishes.

QP confusion,"My PC died on me so I picked up OW2 on my Xbox since my account stuff carries over now. Last time I did rank (support) on console over a year ago I was gold. 

Recently in QP I’m finding that I am getting grouped with anyone from gold to GM. The last few games I’ve played today had diamond and master dps and tanks, at least for the profiles I can view. I’ve been looking because I can tell the skill ceiling is much higher in a lot of these games. Or a few players are steam rolling. 

Is this just a normal thing for console queue? To have such disparity between ranks in QP? Is it an mmr thing where it’s placing me with higher ranks due to like a win streak or something?

Endorsement level used as a metric for toxicity and performance.,"Ok, Ik, the title sounds way too serious/pretentious, lol, but I didn't know how to phrase to make it sound clear and not ranty. 

Well, since the beggining the endorsement system has been kind of a community barometer to identify toxic/positive players (Level 1 toxic, Level 4 positive), ofc it's not accurate because there are several variables involved like the decay caused for not playing or leaving matches,  and, at some degree, the positive bias towards supports after a good match. That doesn't mean that anybody with Level 1 is toxic, maybe is just somebody that took a break or mains a hated hero, but even so I think the system can give you a rough idea of what kind of players you have on your team.

That's about the social part, but can the system also tell us something about the potential performance of a player? I have my own experience and bias regarding endorsement level and match performance, for example, in QP I've noticed that people above level 3 normally play ""poorly"" (didn't know how to call it without being rude, sorry) and seems to stay out of ranked, with level 5 being the most notable examples; in ranked it's more of a mixed bag, I don't remember seeing many people with level 4, but I've been playing mostly QP lately so it's hard to tell for me if the same happens there. 

Again, this is a completely personal and, most likely, skewed perception, it's not meant to be a rant or to call out any kind of player, I just would like to read what do you think about the system because I really think it can give us some additional info about the player base.",Overwatch,1705867438.0,t3_19ccafb

Has the QP matchmaking always been this horrible?,"I’ve been solo queuing quick play over the past week and the experience has been downright abysmal. This is a fairly new account (roughly 50 hours) that I didn’t even play ranked on. Btw I’ve always solo q’d on this account, never stacked. 

Listen, I absolutely do not care about wins or losses in qp because I play for fun and try different things. However the matchmaking seems so horribly wonky that it’s starting to remove any enjoyment.

Overall I’ve won 20% of my games the past week. I’m talking stomp after stomp, 15 streak losses. I’ve been playing for 3 years and this has never happened to me. It always seems like my team is playing for the first time and is completely lost. I typically have the strongest stats (I play all roles) and my team goes 3-0-11. Unless I hard carry every single game we will literally get spawn camped. Let me clarify, I don’t care if my team are noobs! But stop constantly putting these people against doped up Genjis and insane Junkerqueens. 


The enemy counterpicks almost instantly and plays with OWL level synergy. Why does it feel like for someone who is solo queuing I’m going against stacks? I understand the MMR system for qp is much more volatile and I don’t mind going against teams way better than mine every now and then, as long as it’s all even. However an entire week of sweaty team after sweaty team while I solo q? 

My DPS is on Junkrat? You better believe they’ll come out with Pharmercy or Echomercy. The counterswapping culture has infected quick play and is making the game so unfun and boring. Neither tank sticks with one hero for more than 3 minutes, it’s so ridiculous. 

I can hold my own and pose some threat to the enemy team but I don’t want to sweat my ass off, I want to relax! I don’t want to play Ana or Zen because enemy Hog keeps yeeting my Brig off the map 8 times (yes this happened in one game!). I don’t want to play Widowmaker because the enemy Widow keeps taking everyone’s heads while they walk in a straight line on Circuit.

Why does it feel like people are treating qp like it’s ranked? Instant counter picks, unnecessary toxicity and everyone seems sooooo miserable. It’s like these people can only have fun if they win. Have people stopped playing ranked and now coming to qp in droves to stomp on noobs? Because it certainly feels like it. When I’m on the winning side and stomp the opposition it doesn’t feel fun either because it’s clear they never stood a chance. 

I play qp to unwind and not take myself seriously. But it really feels like people take themselves VERY seriously. 

Hell I started playing ranked on this account because the matchmaking unironically seems better. Wtf is going on with this game?",Overwatch,1705866558.0,t3_19cbxol

"Please someone explain to me(who preferably also mains tank), how orisa is not broken?","I play tank mostly at the moment and man is Orisa so fucking annoying. Combine that bitch with an ana and lifeweaver? Yeah that motherfucker is not going down. Like at all. An orisa that can time their CD well is literally invincible. My point is there is no tank that can actively counter her well. I guess zarya to a degree but even then, everything has to go right.  Im in diamond on PC btw. But yeah before I never really cared what the other tank plays but anytime you feel like you got a good chance to win the match, an Orisa comes walking out of spawn.   


Sick and tired of OW making the most braindead, easy to play characters the best. Like reaper?? Last night i played against 3 teams of Orisa and reaper in a row. How tf am I supposed to do anything as ANY tank when my team refuses to switch to anything meaningful. I had a mercy yesterday pocketing a 2-6 soldier with 2k damage after we defended on payload. And this bitch was telling me that I am the problem???

Self-heal is necessary to make up for the removal of 6v6,"With 6v6, DMG was able to be spread around. With the removal of 1 tank, squishes were going to get targeted, pressure was going to rank up, and one small mistake by a person would be able to cost a game. Less mistakes could be made, which, of course, is good in a sense (because then bad fundamentals will be necessarily punished), but this means if you suck (and since most of us are not in Masters, we pretty much suck), you could cost your teams a lot of games, just as much as any of your other teammates can. The removal of 6v6 really was detrimental for the game. I think self-heal will change that. 

I play a lot of support, mainly Kiriko, Moira, and Mercy. Although these are low-skilled characters, I’ve found that they have an incredible ability to survive, which is only enhanced by the self-heal. Without the self-heal, I’m not sure they would be playable. There would be too much pressure on supports to heal supports. With how easy it is to die now in OW2, self-heal was a necessary component to keep people playing support. It’s become apparent that self-heal will be necessary to keep people playing at all. 

Finally being able to get some independence from the horrible team-dependency this game puts in you is something I look forward to, both for those people that are affected by *my* bad games, as well as for people that will find the independence liberating. It feels similar to the addition of role-queues, which was also a necessary must for the game. Looking forward to seeing how self-heal plays out.",Overwatch,1705861409.0,t3_19c9vlb

This keeps his DPS the same but removes headshots against 200 HP targets 

Sonic arrow buff: characters lit up by Sonic take +50% damage from Hanzo's base arrows.

So he can do 270 headshot damage when shooting a soniced target. This rewards the cool setup of getting a sonic and preparing your shot.

overwatch needs more movement abilities - rant,"reaper, sombra, genji, soldier, rein and lucio are all really fun to play.

sym, zarya, lifeweaver, ana, bap and mei all make me crave death whenever i play mystery heroes.

this might just be me, but im not a fan of walking towards an objective to heal my dumbass teammate on point who for some reason thinks i can heal through walls, only for my max speed to be about 2 miles per decade. im not saying every character needs wall running or boosts, im saying why the fuck are soldier, lucio and sombra the only people who figured out the ability to run? i don't think everyone should have the run ability, like tanks for the most part should be slow, tracer is fast enough without it, and bastion feels like he shouldn't be able to either. just let me run goddammit.

genji is pretty fast with dash, and wallclimbing can give you shortcuts to save time. rein has charge, which now since it can be cancelled you can just slide right into battle and put up shield mid charge. reaper can teleport and go ghost even if the TP does require me to schedule an appointment beforehand cus jesus christ hurry up. 

zarya runs about the same speed as a turtle with a missing leg. bap can jump up to high areas but honestly if i can just change that to the shit illari has i'll take it. ana is the most lore accurate cus i actually feel like im playing as an elderly woman with a broken hip. lifeweaver is the fucking worst offender, cus the amount of times i for some reason think im playing lucio and go to speedboost, only to pull my teammate back so we have to slowly walk together is more times than i want to admit. sym is the only one mentioned in the second section who has a movement ability that can move you forward, but it moves you across such a short distance that honestly you are better off walking it. oh and mei? yeah fuck mei. genuinely idk how people play as mei or sym and have fun, i personally enjoy playing my games but apparently experiencing the gameplay is not for everyone. JUST GIVE ME A FUCKING ICE SLIDE ABILITY, IVE NEVER USED WALL ONCE IN MY ENTIRE TIME PLAYING MYSTERY HEROES, JUST LET ME FROZONE THIS BITCH AND HAVE FUN.

for all the hate pharah gets, and for the hate echo has dodges despite being objectively more annoying than pharah, they are fun to play. if you have good aim then you can pretty easily take them out, but both are still really fun. echo can stay in the air longer than the fucking clouds themselves, while pharah can get across the map really quickly with both her abilities used together. just use knockback on yourself while exiting spawn, and use rocket boost right as the knockback hits, congrats you have just made it halfway to point.

i hate playing defense solely cus of the fact that if i die, which btw yes i fully am aware it is a skill issue when i die, you have to walk the entire width of russia just to go back to the fight. nothing says gameplay like walking for ten hours. i know its not even that gamemodes fault but honestly if i didn't consider it a dick move i would just let the enemy team move the payload up further just so i could actually play the game. this can all be fixed with more movement abilities.

people will say high mobility characters are annoying to fight, which i respond with the fact that if everyone is highly mobile then it will be more balanced. some people will also say that this could make some characters broken, i respond with this list of every fuck i give about that information:

I think I saw a streamer shooting it off at about 40 or 45, I can't remember exactly, and would charge it to max if there was down time and thought damage was going to be coming in soon.

Should I just give up on DPS and only play tank?,"I've jumped around DPS mains for awhile before discovering I do like playing Sombra a lot more than others, but I'm really kinda bad on basically any DPS hero and usually get obliterated rather quickly, die in dumb ways and get low damage numbers.

I'm like 10 times more effective on tank, I get good damage, usually a lot of mit too, and I just generally do decent as a tank. I'd say overall I'm a tank main.

I'm kinda ok on support but don't really care about playing support.

I like playing dps when I'm able to actually do things, but most of the time I feel kinda useless and don't feel like I have much effect on the match.

Should I just give up on DPS and only play tank because it's the only role I both like, and also don't suck at?",Overwatch,1705828539.0,t3_19bzih1

2 (3?) Improvements for Rein to add skill expression for higher ranks,"1. Make charge consistent. That's an obvious, low effort one. I know left side scoops right side boops... But even then I'm booping people with my center and left, so it doesn't make much sense sometimes.

2. Add a quick melee hitbox (30 damage, 2 meter range) to firestrike. This will allow him to deal slightly more damage to tanks deep in his face, which he is strangely bad at, and will add a way of targetting individual Squishies in a way that is more skillful (and committal) than a hammer swing. A melee firestrike on someone that is WAY too close + a hammer swing would then do 215 damage.

3. This one is more experimental, so a hard maybe. But... Reduce his shield maximum to 1200 (making it bigger just makes it take longer to recharge anyway) and make it so whenever firestrike hits then the shield recharges for 100. This would reward him for good firestrikes against multiple enemies in an additional way, and add more skill expression to Rein's shielding.",Overwatch,1705827612.0,t3_19bza66

"Which hero do you think is the most poorly designed, unhealthy character for the game?","Having one shots in a game like Overwatch where healing damage dealt to your teammates is an essential part of the game is unhealthy. Widowmaker’s primary is a sniper rifle that can do 300 damage with a headshot up to a certain range (forgot the exact range but I think it was 40m), meaning that she always has the ability to one shot. Insta killing people removes the threat of your damage getting healed (except for mercy who can rez 1-2 times a fight).

In a 5v5 format, being down a teammate is detrimental and more often than not, leads to you losing the fight. Widow has ample opportunity to instantly remove someone from the fight with little risk because she’s a long range character.

This is just my opinion and I would be glad to hear all of yours.",Overwatch,1705825500.0,t3_19bys31

So.. is QP just Comp-Lite now or what?,"Probably gonna get flamed, but the leaver penalties are harsh. They almost make QP feel like comp, in that if you leave, you can’t queue again! Wasn’t that the point of QP? To be able to have the freedom to not play comp, and to be able to leave a game after burning out? 

If you play 5 consecutive games on QP, and you start fizzling out at game 3, per say, you *dont* and *shouldnt* have to stay in the game , esp if doing so will weaken and hurt your team. Leaving can give a chance to get better players to fill, but that is limited now. 

If you play 5 consecutive games in comp, you have to play 5 consecutive games no matter what, ***as it should be***.

WHY implement these types of restrictions which can only cause frustration? Hoping they add something like what QP used to be in arcade because as of now, QP does not feel like QP.

"Help! I don't know how this is possible, but I think I'm stuck in elo hell but in quick play","Hi guys, I don't know if anyone experienced this before, but I've been consistently having < 30% winrate on Quick Play for the last 4\~ weeks.

Me and 2 friends play together almost exclusively, and we only play for fun, on quick play, not sweating, and we are very okay with losing. However we don't just throw every game, we do try to win, almost always.

All 3 of us were overwatch 1 players and we stopped playing overwatch 2 around season 1 and we came back this season. This problem has been happening since we returned to the game.

We know that there is a hidden MMR on QP. So I was under the assumption that, even if we were straight up throwing every game, which we aren't, if we lose enough, the matchmaking would eventually match us with people that are enough low level for us to have a fair fight, but apparently I was wrong.

Today we beat our record of worst session ever, with a 10% winrate ([lost 9 games and won 1](https://imgur.com/c2dzhvt)). But I do have to point out that today was kind of a ""bad day"" because I tried new heroes that I normally don't play (so yeah, it's on me this time). As we lost more and more I switched to heroes that I am more comfortable with but it didn't make a difference. On average a ""common"" winrate for us would be around 25%.

One of the friends in the trio plays ranked without us (and he is Silver). Me and the third friend don't play ranked. But I assume we all would have similar ranks if we did play it. I was gold (support) in overwatch 1 but I really don't think I'm playing as well as then, so silver is a very fair ranking for me, if not lower.

We are bad at the game but we keep on getting matched with far better players, and that doesn't make sense. People get mad sometimes and tell me I'm bad, and I really don't know what to say to them, the problem is the matchmaking, I can't simply summon the spirit of SuperTF to bully me into playing better.

We are ok with losing, but damn, 10% winrate is hard to overlook (specially when I need to win 35 games to get the heroes I missed).

I came here asking for help but actually just kinda wanted to vent. I hope someone could give me a light on theories of what could be causing this, and how to fix it, if it is at all possible. Is this whole scenario eligible as a ticket for customer support?

Do we really need to move our fun to the ladder just to not feel as bad?

I'll end this with the sentence that became my catchphrase: ""This matchmaking is a joke"".

I hope they also adjust the QP matchmaking when revamping the competitive next season.",Overwatch,1705809834.0,t3_19bukx6

Critical Hit Multiplier,"Hey y’all! I wanted to start a new discussion about a topic I've thought about recently and wanted to ask about in depth (including *all* heroes, not just a specific one). This is purely for fun and to see what thoughts this can provoke! So here we go:

Most heroes who are able to obtain critical hits have a 2x multiplier; 26 of the 39 heroes to be exact (Sojourn (primary) and Widow (secondary) inclusive). It's clear this was the original concept with the launch of OW1, but since then, we now have 5 outlier heroes: Widowmaker (primary) and Kiriko with 2.5x and Roadhog, Illari, and Sojourn (secondary) with 1.5x. 

Something of note here is that Widow, Roadhog, and Sojourn all *released* with a 2x multiplier and have since been adjusted to their current ones, all for different reasons. Illari and Kiriko are the only two heroes who debuted with unique multipliers, though Kiriko's has *also* been modified since her release. 

**What are your thoughts on more heroes having varied/unique critical multipliers?** Not to only consider the multiplier itself, but to also consider modifying base damage—and if you'd like think in an even deeper aspect—fire rates, ammo capacity, spreads, etc. **Which heroes do you think would benefit from this and could potentially improve the feel of gameplay for both sides of a lobby? Is the common 2x multiplier relied on too heavily or should it be more enforced (i.e. bring outlier heroes to match the 2x multiplier)?**

I'm really curious to see what thoughts y'all have! :) I'll eventually put some of my own input in the replies, but want to hear others' opinions first.

*Note: the 10 heroes that do not have critical hit multipliers (for this post's purpose) fit under 3 other categories that I'll deem* ***Melee*** *(Brig and Rein),* ***Constant*** *(Moira, Winston, and Ana), and* ***Splash*** *(Junkrat, Pharah and Sigma). Symmetra and Zarya would both be considered Constant and Splash. These are balanced slightly differently than all other heroes. For example, all Splash heroes have different direct to splash damage ratios, and this shows that value variance is common. I could go into the numbers too, but all of those are on the Wiki and would be redundant for me to repeat here.*",Overwatch,1705797300.0,t3_19bqjmc

Lore reason wrecking ball's guns are so weak?,"Sweet Jesus man. Is there a reason blizz doesn't want to buff ball in the slightest?

His damage is so pitifully low even when utilizing every aspect of his kit, not to mention his guns themselves have tiny magazine size, super long reload, and awful spread.

anyone else feel like torbjorn needs a rework?,"I feel like his turret is the only reason you'd pick him over someone else who can spam down mid. torbjorn is supposed to be some crazy smart engineer and all that really happens is he has one tiny turret that he throws down. any other thing he has is vaguely tied to engineering or not at all. like think about how interesting the engineer is in tf2. his whole schlick IS tending to his mechanics and builds. 

sym feels more of an engineer than than torb is, which is sad. with torb it feels like he has a turret just as an afterthought even though they're allegedly torbs life work and passion. ow is no stranger to taking from tf2 for ideas so screw it, why not just take a dispenser thing for his teammates that only gives out ammo and make his sentry more interesting like ow1? I don't know why they got rid of that. 

his ultimate seems super uninspired as well. I get he is a defense hero but again, why not have him be able to throw down a second turret that has lots of health and is very powerful? that'd be more powerful than lava on the floor honestly. and interesting on top",Overwatch,1705780747.0,t3_19bkd71

Why do supports have immediate beef with their dps," 

Supports are either gods or have don't have peripheral vision.

I main dps(Ashe, Echo Sojurn)I've noticed that supports I play with will almost always prioritize tank over dps. At face value it makes sense(something about Tank --> Fellow support --> DPS) but my tank could be near or at max health and I could be next to my supports on life support begging for heals but our supports will be so locked into not letting our tank a lick of damage that they'll forget I exist or just flat out ignore me. Now I COULD press X and ask for heals but if I press it one too many times I get yelled at.

My question is: Is there a reason why supports healbot tanks and then blame dps instead of trying to understand what the problems are(doesn't mean the dps AREN'T lacking but it goes both ways.)",Overwatch,1705767563.0,t3_19bfbmv

Help troubleshooting performance issues on Ryzen APU,"Hello everyone!

The game struggles even at 720p low settings, with FPS fluctuating from 60 down to 15/20/30 in a matter of seconds, 0 stability at all. What could cause this issue? Is there any way the system might not be actually using ram in dual channel configuration? Is that any way to check that?

After 13 games of comp I noticed there were significantly less counter picking in comp than in qp. I would notice because im a genji otp. 

In almost every qp match where Im doing good, at least 2 people on the enemy team swaps to soft counters, like mei, moria, phara, etc. In my 13 games of comp there I saw significantly less counter swapping. Maybe one person from the enemy team swapped but it wasn’t impactful to the game whatsoever.

Tips for getting better (I don't suck but I ain't exactly top 500 either),"As a Nintendo switch Overwatch player (don't judge I wanna see if it's possible to be good on switch), and still just kinda playing casually but looking to maybe get more competitive, what are some tips ya'll can give when it comes to playing supports like mercy/zen or dps like bastion/rat (I generally don't play as much tank)?

Lifeweaver tips,"Over 50 hours on Lifeweaver, these are all my tips and tricks I use while playing him! 

• use his platform to nullify Ashe’s dynamite. The platform usually absorbs the blast

• use his platform to block doorways and stairs—this really only applies when you’re trying to block enemies off

• use his platform to detect enemies. Sometimes when I’m healing the dps like to flank me. I place my platform behind me so they’ll have to trigger it to get to me (warning me of their presence). 

• use his tree similar to Mei’s wall (to block DVA bomb, block rein charge, block JQ ult, separate my team from the enemies in general 

• lifegrip teammates with no mobility to help get them into position or closer to the team if they had to respawn (Ana…)

• lift up souls with his platform to allow Mercy to safely rez 

• use his platform to lift up enemy orisa and reaper when they’re ulting

• use his platform to lift slept teammates, frozen teammates, and rein shattered teammates

• lifegrip teammates into tracer bombs

Genji Powershift Idea,"I was hoping this would get some traction and an idea we could try, but can we powershift genji to allow him to be a more well-rounded hero that will be more useful to his teams, instead of being overly dependent on a two ult combo every 2-3 min to jsut be of use? I thought of something like this by giving him a similar treatment to hanzo where he can be more self-reliant:  


Shuriken Damage increased from 27 to 29  
Dragonblade Damage increased from 110 to 125.  
While Dragonblade is active, damage boost will no longer be applied.   


Something like this I believe will make him a healthier character and not being so overly dependent on the two ult combo just to win games. Agree, Disagree, or any other ideas you may have?

Stand up and fight,"As a Reaper main in Overwatch 2, I, like many others, have been put through a lot. Reaper has had his fair share of ups and downs in Overwatch's history, but this latest round of nerfs to his ""lucky color"" voice line is too much.

We Reaper mains are a unique breed. We are the silent assassin types, the ones who lurk in the shadows and come out to strike at the most opportune moment. We are the ones who take the time to learn the ins and outs of our character, perfect our skills, and create an atmosphere of fear when we enter the battlefield.

But now, with the nerfs to our voice line, we are being silenced, pushed aside, and treated as though we don't matter. We have been relegated to the background, and treated as though we are not integral to team success. This is a travesty, and we will not stand for it.

Reaper mains, it's time to rise up! It's time to show the world that we are a force to be reckoned with. It's time to demonstrate that even without our ""lucky color"" voice line, we are powerful, intelligent, and capable of anything.

It's time to let our shotguns do the talking. It's time to show the world what we're made of. It's time to show the Overwatch community and Blizzard that we will not be silenced, that we are not to be ignored, and that we are not to be taken lightly.

Reaper mains, it's time to show the world who we really are—the dark, mysterious, destructive force that lives on the edges of the battlefield, waiting patiently, biding our time, until the moment is right to strike.

Stand with me, Reaper mains. Stand tall, hold your shotguns high, and show the world that we will not be silenced, that we will not be ignored, and that we will not be defeated. We are Reaper mains, and we are here to stay!",Overwatch,1705722194.0,t3_19b2ho5

Dealing with way too many leavers in Competitive.,"I love logging on to what used to be my favorite game just for my first match of the day to go like this.

I don’t even understand why, we did pretty good the first round. We pushed to 3 with 1:48 left. But as soon as the enemy got to the first checkpoint, the other support left. Then the dominos kept falling as the game went on.

It feels like too many of my matches have been going like this recently. People leaving as soon as the fight becomes a little more difficult it seems. Definitely feels impossible to rank up.

Side note, I really dislike how payload comp games can go to up to 4 rounds sometimes. Feels so long it becomes unfun. Especially when this is the way the match goes.

Settings Menu is Frustrating,"I've only played for about a year, so I'm just now learning the finnicky rules of the Settings menu. Here's a rant of some design choices that grind my gears:

1. If you change a setting so it's the same as all-heroes, it loses the asterisk. But if you change all-heroes, it still remembers that setting was edited in the past and doesn't update those, and there's no indicator for this.
2. Delete Override is the button to do what you wanted to do in #1. But it changes ALL the settings, for ALL tabs, for ALL heroes: options, keybindings, sensitivities, reticles, etc.
3. If you want to change a setting back to its default, same thing: all settings, all tabs, all heroes (at least I think so, I'm too scared to press it)
4. There is no way to ""delete override"" or ""return to default"" for a single setting. If you really want to do it, you'd need to screenshot all your asterisked settings for every hero, Delete Override, and manually change back all the hero-specific settings, sliders, hotkeys, and reticles. The shorter way is actually to go through every hero and change the hotkey, maybe taking a screenshot of what the setting is for All Heroes and have it open on a second monitor (I'm in the process of doing this for the voiceline shortcuts, which I use numpad for).
5. Delete Override is a dangerous button to press. It's right next to the most frequently pressed button in the menus. There is no confirmation when you click it, it erases your settings for all heroes instantly.
6. In replays, the hotkeys to operate the free camera are not shown in the settings, you just have to know it's WASD to track/raise and mouse to pan/tilt. But the mouse controls don't even work until you press N to close the timeline. And there is no hotkey (that I know of) to move the camera forward with the payload; you have to pan 90 degrees and crab-walk the camera forwards.
7. In S7, the Tab button didn't function during POTG because it interfered with the Endorse menu. But after changing Scoreboard to a different key, there are times when the Scoreboard is hard-coded to use Tab, like when waiting to respawn or in the hero-select phase. But I'll let this slide because it's probably an actual bug.
8. Bit of a tangent, since most people use the default setting of having their profile hidden, just grey-out the ""View Profile"" option if they do, instead of having to open it just to see if it's there. Same with inviting someone to your group if they're in another group already.",Overwatch,1705705363.0,t3_19awjac

Should Damage and Healing Numbers be Removed From Scoreboard?,"Mostly the headline.

I think it would be a major quality of life upgrade and there aren’t many positives to keeping them on the scoreboard.

I feel like it only causes division and frustration having the damage and healing numbers on the main scoreboard.

It might be there because it would feel a little empty.

But I don’t think it actually provides much insight in a positive way.

If people want to find someone to blame their loss to they’ll yell at the person with the lowest damage or support with lowest healing.

And people who seem to understand the game at a high level pay almost no attention to those numbers.

(Not saying I understand it at all high level, I just know not to yell at people based on healing and dmg stats)

I’m not saying remove those numbers from the game, they should still be in your personal stats.

I just think it causes way more problems than it helps and would maybe make the game a better place.

Especially with the devs saying they are trying to make the game less crappy if you’re team isn’t working together,

Sure it's not fun having someone flame you but I think the positive interactions far out weigh the negative, even if they are a bit more rare. The report system is creating an environment where the only people who feel comfortable speaking are the toxic ones and it really sucks.",Overwatch,1705696047.0,t3_19asumk

Streamers: A Positivity Segment,"Got a blip on my reddit feed from Overwatch TMZ, and the post was created specifically to crap on streamers.  So insert lots of name calling and insulting of mostly big name streamers, a few small timers.  Including one reply saying that streamer X was just disgusting to even look at.

So, with that in mind, I want to do a bit where instead of saying the worst parts of streamer culture, we talk about what we *like* about out favorite streamers, be it big or small.

For myself, I only have a few that I tune into consistently.  The two biggest are Flats and Emongg.  And keeping it to the positive, Flats does have a deep understanding of the game and a lot of good insight.  While he focuses on things relevant to top players, his takes are still generally on point and he has a good sense of balance.  If you want information on the game, he probably has it.

Emongg is just a positive guy.  I mean, enough said.  He's nearly always chill, respectful, and just upbeat and positive, in addition to game knowledge.  My favorite quote is ""Alright, let's go Dva"" when another tank isn't working for him.

I've tuned into Jay3 a few times because his being over the top is amusing at times, and if I'm in the right mood his commentary on patches etc can hit just right.

KarQ I don't do as much anymore, but also a generally respectful guy with informative takes, and makes the effort to consider higher and lower tiers of play when he says things.

Last couple, I came across Kitdy a while ago.  Not usually on when I'm up to watch or listen to streams, but every time I've been on she's had a very upbeat and engaging presence.  Makes you feel like you are actually part of the conversation.

Same basically goes for Deemzies from The Omnic Post.  This guy is basically in the heart of the player base in terms of takes and skills.  He's not a top player, he's not a bottom player.  His takes are relevant to the mass of the player base, he loves to chat and engage, and he is very upbeat.  When I'm not just listening to a streamer for my background noise and I actually want to engage, this guy is my go-to.

So, who are youre favorite streamers and why?  Please keep it all to the positive side and if you have a complaint about a streamer... .[https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchTMZ/comments/199lvyw/which\_streamers\_do\_you\_dislike/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchTMZ/comments/199lvyw/which_streamers_do_you_dislike/)   There's already a thread for you, go there, not here.",Overwatch,1705684769.0,t3_19aoa8k

"Making a case for Quicker Play: It's not perfect, but at least hear me out","TL;DR at the end

I found that it did a few things really well, most of which was cutting out ""downtime / wait-time"" for lots of different interactions, and increasing the value of playing together as a proper team. Was it supremely perfect out of the box? Absolutely not, but few things are. 

I'm not an expert, but I have close to 1k hours in this game and I feel like the community backlash was overblown. It does play differently than normal QP, and does require that players make some adjustments in their approach, and if there's one thing people seem to hate, it's changing their understanding of something.

----

**Respawn times** 

* A single early pick is more likely to be able to rejoin a team-fight before the rest of the team starts to go down, and it becomes a staggered mess, reducing the ""wait around to group up again"" phase. 
* It also means that losing one or two people isn't an immediate death sentence, if the remainder can scrap on the point long enough for their team to come back
* If you get half your team down, it's less waiting for the stragglers to die and respawn so you can group and push again. 
* Your team is more likely to actually wait and group up when it only takes about 4 seconds at most. 
* When you *do* have that one guy that runs off and dies alone, there's a greater chance that they respawn with other teammates  and get shepherded back into the team-play / objective
* Your own respawn is short enough that you ""stay in the game"" more mentally. I personally have ADHD, and would often alt-tab out, or take a bit or two from a snack, or do something that mentally disconnected me from the game while waiting to respawn. You can't really do that anymore with the combination of shortened times and grouped timers. For me this was a big help in keeping up the energy and momentum. 


**Team Play** 

* I found the urgency that was created by things being sped up, lead to better and more cohesive teamplay on average. You *have to* play the objectives, or they just go up in smoke. A lot of the ""roll-or-be-rolled"" feeling was when you had groups that weren't playing cohesively. 
* It also felt like you don't have to wait for your team to ""wake up"" in the last 45 seconds as often, because there's already some urgency to it. There isn't time to fart around by themselves way out of position and die 4 times, you have to participate *now*
* Team-Fights are where the excitement is for me, and there were way more 5v5 fights than with regular QP.


**General ""Immersion"" and game-feel**

* With the greater emphasis on playing the objectives as a team, it felt like there was a refreshed ""purpose"" to the objectives again (especially for escort). It feels like you have to get this thing out of here before the bad-guys get their hands on it, and they're really going to try, because they have a small window to do it (because urgency). It feels more like you're dealing with an actual heist, rather than taking a truck for a walk. 
* Team plays feel more impactful, like you are a crack squad of specialist that were brought together to get shit done; like a well oiled machine. In comparison, regular quickplay feels like a bunch of hero-jerks that think they're hot shit, trying to lone-wolf their way through a problem.  
* Enemy respawns feel like reinforcements that were called in to actually sand-bag you, and take back the building/cargo/whatever. 
* If the point flips in overtime, it's much faster to take it from 0 to 100%, and your games don't drag out forever.
* Teammates (and myself) were much more likely to use their ultimate abilities, rather than sitting on them and waiting for ""the right time"" that never comes, keeping the tempo of the game up. 
* Losing doesn't sting so much when the games are short, and winning feels more rewarding with the increased emphasis on teamplay and working together to a common end. 


----

**Common Criticisms:**

* *Not enough time to switch* -- I think there could be certainly be some tweaks to Ult-charge retention that would make it less punishing to swap off of a struggling hero when you have high/full ultimate charge. If a hero isn't working out well, I think players will have to get used to committing to a change sooner, rather than trying to make it work the whole game, and then swapping in the last 45 seconds (see previous points). 
* *It's more queue time and less gameplay* -- I'm personally a healer main, and my numbers were as high (and even higher in a few matches) than regular QP games, because of greater amount of time actually playing the objectives with my team. By also cutting out the waiting-around part of the gameplay, I found it to be more ""action-per-minute"" once you're in the match. 
* *It ends too soon / There are only 2 or 3 team fights before it's over* -- For me this comes back to the immersion discussion, where the fights feel like they *actually matter*, and your team needs to work together to get through it. If you fail, the team respawns quickly, and you can all get back in there to try again sooner. If your team isn't working together well, then at least the whole match is over faster and you can move on, instead of being dragged through an extended, terrible match. Additionally queue times would reduce a little bit overall, as matches are shorter and players are available for match-making again sooner. 

----
**My own feedback**

* The speeds could be tweaked with more consideration to the game-mode/map you are playing. 
* They could make some adjustments to respawn times, with some consideration for overtime mixed in there (mostly to prevent infinite trickling overtime)
* Adjustments to Ult-charge retention when changing characters to make it a little less punishing to swap, given the shorter match times

I'm sure there are things I'm not considering or am ignorant of because I don't have much time-played on specific heroes. All I can say is that I enjoyed the faster pacing, and made Overwatch feel more like an actual *team-based game* again by rewarded players for actually working together to achieve something. 

---

##**TL;DR** -- It cuts out a *lot* of the downtime you spend waiting for respawns and grouping, and makes it feel like an actual team game again by rewarding you for *playing the freaking objectives together** leading to a more immersive game, and more action-per-minute

I made it to Gold 3 somehow.,"I previously posted about being thrown into Gold lobbies immediately after finishing the 50 wins in QP.

I started out in comp playing support, got rolled and won 1 out of 3 matches. Then I tried DPS, lost again. Afterwards I decided to do open queue and played Tank without high hopes, I won and decided to Role Queue on Tank and main Ramattra. It turns out I wasn't just in Gold but actually Gold 4 specifically and after going 5-4 I ranked up to Gold 3.

I tried to play support again later and got rolled so I think I'm gonna be a tank main from now on. I still don't believe I deserve to be in Gold and I've been lucky enough to get randoms capable of carrying my sorry ass through matches coz of the games I have lost it wasn't even close, like I got destroyed and of the games we've won it was by the skin of my teeth",Overwatch,1705683079.0,t3_19anl8b
Why are people already saying Muagas Kit needs a rework?," I watch YouTube videos occasionally about Overwatch and a reoccurring theme in all of them is that Muagas kit doesn’t lend itself to being balanced.

  Most YouTubers spout the same opinion of “He’s impossible to balance his kit doesn’t lend itself to ever being balanced, he’ll always be either OP or underpowered” at the end of that they usually compare him to roadhog. 

 I wouldn’t be writing this post if it was just Muaga, but it seems like with every new hero (aside from JQ) released since OW2 this same rhetoric has been repeated. It’s bland af I support discourse, but come on this same talking point has already been beat to death. We’ve seen it with sojourn “her railgun can never be balanced she’s essentially widow with no downside that comes with actually playing widow”, “Ramattras kit is loaded, he can punch through shields and has a crazy ult. Great job blizzard this hero is game breakin and OP”, “LWs kit is clunky and needs to be reworked”.

 I’m convinced that if Reinhardt was added today this same sentiment would be spewed. It’d probably go something like “NEW HERO REINHARDT CANT BE BALANCED EITHER HIS HAMMER DOES TOO MUCH DAMAGE OR NOT ENOUGH, blizzard needs to go back to the drawing board with this one”.

 OW players give zero time to allow things to play out and automatically chalk a characters core design up as a failure because they’ve played 10 games with it. 

 If any of you have played streetfighter, I think OW can learn something from the balance of their game they haven’t released a single balance change in the 7 months of the game being released during that time metas have shifted, characters have risen and fallen on the tier list previous S tiers have fallen to D and vice versa. All because Capcom let things play out.

 In conclusion I just wish OW players would demonstrate a modicum of patience with new characters and take the time to learn how and where the strengths can be applied.",Overwatch,1705682254.0,t3_19an9lu
Victorian era Tracer,"Greetings OW community

You might have seen my previous victorian arts through this week, if not, you can find them in Ashe and Widow subreddits.

For this art, I wanted to pushed myself forward, wanted to challenge myself, I am in the process of keep improving my drawing skills, so some stuff on this art might look off. Hope you understand.

Here is the description of this victorian era steampunk theme: 

In the winding streets of a Victorian steampunk cityscape, Tracer emerges as a beacon of temporal elegance. Her attire, a fusion of Victorian fashion and steampunk ingenuity, is adorned with intricate gears, corset lacing, and asymmetrical layers of flowing fabric.

A high-collared, leather-trimmed jacket and fingerless gloves complete her stylish ensemble.Tracer's iconic chronal accelerator receives a captivating steam-powered overhaul, with brass pipes weaving around it like a delicate lattice. 

The device emits a soft hiss as steam escapes, adding an air of mystery to the temporal technology that powers her swift maneuvers. 

Goggles rest atop Tracer's forehead, ready to be pulled down when the need for speed arises.

Her pulse pistols, adorned with Victorian embellishments, echo the era's craftsmanship, featuring ornate scrollwork and a polished bronze finish.

"Intentional feeding, extremely obvious","I am mostly confused if anything, this guy attached with the picture attached joined the game as wooden was shooting the ground and just jumped off a cliff, we were still winning 4v5 so it did not matter as much. He decided it was not enough and now would go to the front lines just to get killed basically charging ennemy ults a lot faster.
He then left the game with 0 dms and came back right after and proceeded to have 0 dmv just getting himself eliminated going to the front lines.

What can I do? This was by far one of my worst experiences and this last few weeks of matchmaking have been awful, just got out of another game which was 4vs5 which we were winning before someone left. Why does the SR not account for this with all the advancements in AI right now they can not add one more parameter?

"Awkward (the streamer) is absolutely cringe, regardless of whether or not he makes some good points.","Does anyone else cringe watching this dude? What's up with his strange hyperfixation on doing damage? I agree that dealing damage as a support is very important, however, he made a video where he solely healbotted, and he also made a video where he only did damage as support, not healing any of his teammates. (Therefore throwing both games btw, because he was not playing the game to his full potential solely for content.) If he won the game during the video where he was only healbotting, he would talk about how he was hard cringing because he was not doing any damage, yet in the video where he was only dealing damage, he got mad at his teammates for getting mad at him because he was not healing them, which is totally justifiable from his teammates. He literally threw a game for content, yet because he was doing damage, he said something along the lines of ""we still won the game, so why are you complaining? "" bro... how are you genuinely be that much of a weirdo. Don't even get me started on his twitter. HOLY FUCK.

And what inspired me to make this post is a short he made on his youtube channel about players who counter-picked. If you're playing pharah against double hitscan, it's going to be much harder for you to consistently do your job because you always have to play in great positions, and how are you not throwing by not switching to another hero? Sure, if you're really good you'll probaby still carry, however, most people are not able to land consistent headshots the way he does. Therefore, how are they a ""silver or gold player"" by counter-picking. It's so annoying, because most of his advice is great, but he also manages to say some of the dumbest things imaginable.

Overall, he gives good advice, but some things you should just not listen to. As much as he says he doesn't blame his teammates he still does. For instance, in one video, he kept whining about his Ana staying on cart, and he followed up by saying ""I cannot blame him though, because if I was playing better I would still win."" By saying the former, you are already blaming your teammate. No shit, if you play perfectly you could probably win that game. The fact that someone as good as him couldn't carry that game means that either someone on your team was throwing, or the other team was playing better. However, you're still blaming a teammate by pointing out a mistake someone on your team was making, which is fine, but you cannot say that and simultaneously tell your audience that you're not blaming your team by saying how if you played better, you'd win. 

His gameplay also does not align with his advice. In the video where he did an unranked to GM on baptiste, he was healing his team, yet he said that that hero basically relies solely on damage. Why is it so hard to acknowledge that as support, you're supposed to do healing and damage simultaneously in order to be super high rank. The way he preaches damage while neglecting healing is very weird to me. I'm only masters (which sounds like a humble brag but master is not what it used to be.), but wtf man.",Overwatch,1705669609.0,t3_19aioa2
Question about getting to Grandmaster/Top 500.,"So my question is simple, is getting Grandmaster/Top 500 just about luck?

I'm a solo Genji main on Console, I worked my way to (currently) Master 4 and (Not to toot my own horn) but I play fairly well basically every match I play. I'm usually always dropping double digit kills while rarely ever touching double digits deaths (My K/D is like 4.3 or something). Even in matches where my team gets rolled, I'm usually still doing fairly well in said matches.

With all of that being said, I'm currently under the impression that it genuinely takes luck (consistently getting good teams, with good coms, good game sense, good aim and etc.) to move up from where I currently am (Master 4). (Again not to sound cocky) But if I were to consistently get teammates that play as well as I do, I'm pretty sure I'd be GM by now. The reason I've been stuck at Master 4 for about a week now is quite literally because my teammates just aren't holding their own weight. Whether it be the Tank of my team, the other DPS, or one or both of my supports.

Honestly I'm fine with staying Master 4, I rarely get mad and I just like to enjoy playing the game! But like I said before, I honestly do think I would be GM by now if I consistently got better teammates with better chemistry. But I wanna hear what you guys have to say/think!

Do you guys agree that it takes luck (to some degree) to move up in rank? I've hit GM in the past so I'm really not concerned with reaching it again, I just want to know everyone's thoughts on the luck question! Looking forward to your responses!",Overwatch,1705669247.0,t3_19aik0g

What an actual ban appeal response sent by a human at Blizzard looks like,"Context: A few months back I was having an especially rough time and it reflected in my attitude in the game. For reference I play at GM level and was losing a LOT for whatever reason. As a result, I got myself banned for a month for being toxic in chat - deserved and I've taken steps to better myself. Not that this is intended to defend myself in any way, but just for clarity my brand of toxicity is ""you're braindead"" and not racism or anything like that. Happy to report I've had no further penalty since then.

For reference, I have thousands of Overwatch hours recorded on this account since 2017 and in that time, until last year, I'd had 1 single comms ban years ago. No suspensions. I also have dozens of reports against other players actioned.

I thought it would be useful/illuminating/funny to share the ban appeal that I received, which was written by an actual human and not just automated like the ridiculous ones I've seen lately (and suspect a lot of them are fake or otherwise leaving out key info).

My appeal reasoning was that it was typical in game banter, which in some ways it was but in a lot of ways it wasn't. That's where the ""I don't think I've crossed a line..."" quote comes from - not something I've seen in any of the recent viral ban responses.

Anyway, here it is (blurred out my personal info and the issue ID in case someone smart and evil could use it against me):

I play support nowadays so I often don’t have to wait longer than a minute before I’m in another match. For DPS and Tank though, it’s a different story, especially in competitive. As we all do like the game and from a design point of view, how do you think Blizzard should approach equalising the role selection in the player base and drop queue times in general?",Overwatch,1705647528.0,t3_19ad3te
"If Mercy were removed, what will be the benefits and drawbacks?","Come from a guy who has most hours on Mercy.

I think the major benefits is that balancing the Damage characters will become much easier since Mercy's pocket healing / damage boosting turns every DPS into monster picks. There are DPS (especially Pharah) being held back from buffs because of Mercy, meanwhile those DPS perform mediocre when not combo with Mercy but too strong when pocketed.

Another benefit is that the gameplay becomes much less frustrating. It's understandable when your hard-earned kill being undone; you have to land consecutive shots to kill one guy while Mercy nullifies your damage by simply holding a button. Also, killing Mercy is easier said than done because how mobile she is. Unlike Team Fortress 2, players receive less healing when taking damage which makes Medic's pocket-healing less frustrating to play against. Medic himself is also very fragile despite he's the second-fastest character.

For the major drawback, the playerbase will decrease since Mercy players take some portion of it (Playerbase decreased -> less money earned for Blizzard). Look around at hero main subreddits, Mercy main subreddit possibly have the most number of members/subscribers (above 30k), meanwhile Ana main & Rein main also have a lot (above 20k). The purpose of Mercy is to attract players who play Medic from Team Fortress 2, just like they make Soldier:76 to attract players from COD; Pharah to attract Quake players or TF2 Soldier mains; etc. 

Another drawback is that Mercy's VA (Lucie Pohl) might lose her job opportunity as there will be no more in-game voice lines for her. Unless they keep her for voicing Mercy in PVE cutscenes or animated shorts in the future.",Overwatch,1705647264.0,t3_19ad1ek

Mercy rez replacement,"the rez discourse is too much. people are complaining and won't stop, so maybe it's time to just give her a different ability. i mean it's not even that fun to use anyway.

my idea was to give her an ability that functions in a similar way but has more counter play. 


u can place a mark on an ally that stays for 2 seconds (time is debatable) and if they die within that time they spawn back in after a second with a maximum of 300hp (meaning that squishies will be at full health while tanks are capped at 300hp). 24 second cd


this gives players a counter to rez (not shooting the enemy once they see the mark) and also raises mercy's skill ceiling (having the timing down so enemies don't have time to react). On top of that this removes the LOS discussion for rez and doesn't make rezzing a tank as frustrating. 


I think mercy's ability should stay single target, as to not mess with her pocket identity as much. Another idea i like is overhealth u can place on an ally (think of it like sym 1.0 shields)

As a support traditionally should be in the backline and not having to take duels or bait out cooldowns 24/7 like tracer she shouldn't be at risk of getting killed instantly.

Why is it so difficult to rank up?,"Two seasons ago, I managed to achieve diamond in sup

Today, I can't get out of silver 1

It seems that the more matches you lose, the less chance you have of ranking up, even if you have the best stats during the game and played really well.

And in several of these matches there is a big difference between players on my team compared to the opposing team, basically either you humiliate or you are humiliated.

There are also several trolls, who end the sup match with 1k healing, or DPSs who are 1/11 (seriously, this actually happened in one of my matches.)

It seems that even if you play impeccably, there will always be someone on your team to ruin the game. And with that, climbing the ranks playing solo becomes an almost impossible task in lower ranks.

Blizzard needs to fix this.

I was the Hanzo, there was only one other real player in my team, the tank, dps and support were either standing afk in base or running and afk standing still in front of the enemy team without shooting. Don't think they were actual people controlling the characters as the movement was very odd (although I am in silver so who knows).

A player on the enemy team messaged in all chat ""All bot team?"" after only like 30 seconds in the match and at first I thought he was just joking as we got rolled first fight.

Change 1: His ultimate now also lets him fly upward, empowering his ultimate based on distance fallen. Second activation propels him downward.

Change 2: The farther he falls, the stronger his ultimate becomes. It becomes a wider cone the farther he falls, until it becomes 360 degrees. It also 1 shots anyone at the center at that point.

How do you not emotional when climbing,"Just like a lot of you, I play comp to climb but the problem for me is that I can get very emotional. I get upset if they a turret because I know my teammates aren’t going to do anything about it. They have a mercy, they can’t aim worth shit (and neither can I to be honest). I sometimes strain my throat yelling obscenities and the like (not into coms). I once gotten so angry that tears started to form. I also greatly tie my self worth to my rank, so if it goes down I feel like an embarrassment and should be ashamed of even trying to reach masters (I’m gold 4).

Play with friends: The only friend I play with is in masters and I prefer to solo queue because I feel like I’m being boosted if I play in a group. I also still get upset if I play with a friend.

A hero that was significantly influenced by poverty?(Diversity question),"Overwatch is praised for its Diverse set of characters and their backstories. We have different ethnicities, queers, races and etc.

But so far we havent seen anyone who was affected significantly by poverty or, in other words, being poor. The closest we got to it probably was Baptiste. But it is not shown nor in his dialogues, nor in his backstory.

It doesnt need to be a money/power hungry villain, it can be a nice guy that promotes modesty.

Is anyone still having fun in this game anymore?,"I feel like the majority of my friends have moved on from OW, but I still find it addicting sometimes. It’s really hard for me to get into an online shooter, so when I do, I hold on longer than most. The dynamic of matches has became increasingly dull though.

At first I appreciated the inclusion of the stat board, since people being toxic with no actual clue what was going on was such a common occurrence in OW 1, but now it’s turned everyone into stat watchers. More focused on a number, then what’s going on in the game.

Most recent match I had a rein push into spawn which kept getting him killed, he proceeded to blame me because he had 5 more kills than me. Kills that get you killed in the process, aren’t actual kills, but this dude didn’t understand that.

It’s crazy that I still see cringy toxic stuff from OW1, along with the stat board obsessing players who have “adapted” to OW2. I can’t go a match without someone calling out a 1 k difference, whether its healing or damage, as soon as someone in the losing team has a slight difference, it’s like all hands on deck.

Y’all need to understand that these matches are long, and the wind can always change, but you’re less likely to gain an advantage if your method of “support” is to abuse your teammates.

The other day I had a tank with half the damage of the opposing one, and all I said was “I believe in us.” They replied “yas queen.” Even though they didn’t match in damage, they ended with like 50 n 6 kills. Most of anyone in the match by far, and we decimated the other team. I’m just saying, I get that we all want to win, and when you have someone who is clearly not getting they need to switch, that’s different. But some of y’all are so ready to blame someone else, it’s like every match somebody needs to blamed. It’s like y’all think if you get in a “tank diff, healers trash, dps threw” then the winning team is gonna think “oh ok, this one guy was good, let’s leave here and respect this one guy.” They literally do not care. Just take the L and move on.
 
Again, I’m not saying we should all just be nice all the time and ignore stupidity, just ask yourself if it’s worth it. Is losing so scary to you that you absolutely cannot have any fun, because if that’s the case, I honestly don’t know why you get on.

Edit: just won a match, high kill count, POTG with Hanzo. Called out by our own tank at the end because of a 1K damage difference. That actually really frustrated me. Our team finished 3 n 1, wasn’t even close. Just, why? *sigh* I think the best advice I’ve gotten is to turn off chat, which is kind of sad cause I’ve had a lot of good feedback from there, and I also like to be able to communicate with my teammates. It’s not even enough to win and rack up headshots, you just need to be aiming for the tank and focus on your damage numbers in order for your team to feel like you contributed…",Overwatch,1705588810.0,t3_199rmiz

Other than that, why do I need to wait so long to just not get a penalty? 4v5 it's pretty much guaranteed loss all the time, I should be able to propose a concede to my teammates and if everybody agrees the game just ends and you move on.

A new concept for the Damage passive.,"Basically, if an enemy hero only has a sliver of ther maximum health left, you deal more damage.

Let's say they have 20% of their max health or less. Damage heroes would deal an additional 50% damage to them.

Like a League execute. Something that helps with securing kills and getting eliminations.

Obviously, you'd need to look into average damage dps to make sure it doesn't make the time to kill go into the ground, and characters like Genji and Tracer would probably get more out of this than most, but I think it could benefit more or less any damage hero.

Not to mention with every hero getting some kind of out-of-combat health regen, it would greatly help there too.

Kiriko could have a 40% win rate and still be frustrating to play against.,"I'm a GM DPS and Support. I've done it with Tracer, Ana, Moira, and Kiriko. so i'm not talking out of my ass knowing the differences between these roles and heroes. I saw a recent thread in the kiriko main subreddit where they legit did not understand the hate she gets all the time claiming she's a high skill character, has the same escapes as sojourn, tracer, reaper, sym, etc... and that she's not that strong citing win rates lots of times which as we know, win rates don't tell the full picture so those are pointless to bring up. Let me explain to people why it's not her balance but it's her kit that is designed to be as frustrating as possible.

so to put it simply...

# Even when you take a fight against Kiriko and win, you lose.

What hero in the game outside of kiriko can missplay every cooldown and still use their mobility to immediately get way to safety and provide team value while ignoring their own positioning?

lets say I take a duel with kiriko and I'm winning and I force both her CD's. I cannot chase her down and punish her. most likely i probably had to use CD's as well and she can TP back into the fight with 0 downtime as she can immediately heal and help her team while i need to walk back before i can do the same. That downtime in a fight is huge. She can keep healing and doing damage but i cannot reengage or catch up to her or my team in the same speed. I need someone else to capitalize on her in the next 7 seconds for her to die and her TP literally took her next to her teammate so she has guaranteed help already. the only way you win is by one shotting her or blocking her suzu and the current S tier DPS to play are Sojourn and Mei because of that reason.

I saw them post about her low accuracy of her kunai as justification that she's not that strong but if even GM players have 16% kunai hit accuracy and it really wasn't that strong why bother at all? Her damage doesn't need to be consistent to have a lot of value. you get it by spamming which makes it even more frustrating on the other end and her low consistency in hitting shots while still providing value is proof of that. and the kunai fly in a straight line so it's not hard to aim at head level spamming. a single headshot on anyone can be a quick pick or easy for someone else to follow up on. she's dangerous up close but also far away. Zen used to be the glass cannnon dps but you could dive Zen players that didn't have good positioning. Kiriko can be scary up close and far away and can't be dove easily. There is no range in which she is all that weak.

Kiriko's TP is also not like moira's fade, you can chase a moira that fucks up her fade and can see where she goes. you can chase a reaper as he telegraphs his TP and stands still for it. Sym needs to build her teleporter and has to be in LOS. Tracer you can literally only blink a short distance and needs to be mindful of how many she has and her cover around her. every hero with mobility still needs to be smart about their positioning. kiriko doesn't need to be. she doesn't have to play around cover and her TP is through walls and instant and it doesn't even need to be aimed. so even if you force her to use it you cannot follow as any hero. the moment she TP's out she also starts regaining health. Even then when other heroes save their mobility to take a risk in the enemy backline it is exactly that a risk they take but not for her.

now lets talk about Suzu. another immortality ability that can deny even hard to hit ultimates by throwing something at the ground. you don't even need to arc it like a nade as it throws in a pretty straight line. it's really not hard to hit a suzu and you can do it every 15 seconds. landing a hard to hit ultimate only to have it absorbed because a support threw something at the ground is frustrating. the skill expression needed to land what used to be game changing ultimates are getting countered by abilities that don't need to be aimed even. at least if i was nano'd as dps and i got slept it felt like the ana earned that. or if i hit a sticky or a grav but it was countered by beat it felt like a worthy trade. now it just feels like every support has an easy mode deny ability to shut down dps and tanks. or sometimes more than one. If i as a tracer am fighting a 2v1 and i blink 180 stick someone, that ultimate shouldn't be countered by a support throwing an ability at the ground. it doesn't feel like Kiriko earned that save vs what i had to do to try and get it.

now to anyone about to say ""you just need to bait out cooldowns first"". if that's what you believe then you are admitting that support dictates which teams win or lose. whichever team misuses their immortality abilities or forces their supports to misuse them is the one that loses and not the team who popped off or who made big plays. sitting there holding ultimates until you see supports make their move isn't fun for everyone else. there is no back and forth right now like there used to be. you used to counter ultimates with other ults and now you just counter them with regular abilities. supports holding these abilities make it so other players can't play. you can't junkerqueen ult knowing suzu is up. you can't sticky as tracer knowing suzu is up. You can't mei blizzard knowing it's up. you can't even grav if you know suzu is up. you can't even chase a kiriko down to kill her so you don't have to worry about it. her entire kit is meant to be frustrating to anyone other than her. you have to sit and wait for kiriko to fuck up to make your play and that is why it's not fun for literally anyone else. has nothing to do with winrate or whether the average player can get value out of her. Her kit dictates you taking action.

in a fair matchup of equally skilled players it is impossible to duel her and feel like you won anything out of that interaction but it is also impossible to ignore her and make a play on someone else. Her whole kit is meant to be frustrating to anyone other than her.

EDIT: To people telling me how to kill kiriko i'm well aware of what people need to do in order to counter her in her current state. Telling me that it requires teamwork to kill her well of course, that's true for any hero but it requires a lot more for her and you cannot 1v1 a kiriko and ever win. that's the whole point. besides even if i call out in comms that kiriko's tp is down what are the odds my whole team is even in voice? what if some are chat banned? every 1v1 duel with heroes in overwatch have a back and forth and each is trying to get the other to misuse their abilities to have an advantage to capitalize and outplay. kiriko doesn't have that. if she fucks up she can suzu and if she fucks up more she leaves in an instant. it's not a healthy design.

EDIT2: saying there are other supports with frustrating immortality abilities isn't a justification for her existing. saying there could be worse things in your opinion is not the strong argument you think it is. it is not a good reason to not try and improve what we have. we have a live game that is literally about constant iteration and changes that will happen so we should constantly want to improve what we have. comparing it to something like sleep dart is also not a fair comparison when i have a lot more confidence in landing a suzu than i do a sleep dart when a genji blades. the skill required for both is vastly different and they both have almost the same cool down. how easy an ability is to perform vs how much value it gets and when it needs to be used all play into how strong something is. most countering abilities are predicts and immortality abilities are reacts and it's much easier to react and perform these immortality abilities than it is to predict whats going to happen. this adds to how frustrating they are to deal with.

EDIT Final: For those still thinking I just want her nerfed into the ground that isn't it. number won't help her. if you think i don't have any ideas of how to do that you'd be wrong. if you want to know where i would hypothetically take her kit here's just me brainstorming what i'd like to see from her. 

* Damage - kunai now have a damage fall off. kiriko is scary up close and should be the brawler/anti dive support but she shouldn't be sniping and getting random picks like hanzo arrows because that's frustrating. this also helps teach players the best way to play her as it's easier to hit projectiles the closer you get so it's designed in a way that actually teaches players the best way to play her naturally. it also gives her a counter of long to mid range poke.
* Healing - her papers are no longer auto aim and actually need to be thrown onto someone where they will stick. they move similar in speed to ana no scoping shots. when you attach a paper to someone it will slowly release a heal over time but never over health. you can attach multiple to one target as well to stack but if you attach too many to one person you won't have them for your other teammates as they need to charge. you can hit them pre emptively to help incoming damage as well. if you miss the paper will attach itself to the closest geometry there and if an ally walks past the paper it will be picked up by them. this will allow kiriko to have more skill expression in her heals as well as help heal people that are constantly out of line of sight. she has a limited number of papers though so she has to pick between helping people flanking, stack them onto one person, or help on the frontline and can't just spam to everyone.
* Swift step - range is shortened but goes a set distance and can pass through one wall but doesn't need a teammate to teleport to. she can use it to just close a distance or get into a nearby room. she can use it to dodge abilities or in a duel for a better position. this means she can now use her mobility offensively or defensively but also needs to be mindful of her environment. it also means the person dueling her can feel like there's a chance to outplay her and her to outplay them.
* Suzu - still cleanses and heals but needs to actually hit an ally to cause the explosion cleanse. no longer makes players intangible or immortal though. however, it can also be throw at enemies to cause them to slow down but still would need to hit them. they still can use their abilities but helps give suzu a means to be used offensively, defensively, and also offensively like on a nano blade to help your team defensively. probably could have it's CD shortened this way as well because it would be harder to hit.
* Kitsune - i have fewest issues with i'm ok with leaving it alone.",Overwatch,1705569619.0,t3_199m559

Has Quicker Play made anyone else play more Competitive recently? Anyone else happier/thankful because of that too?,"Initially I was angry that quicker play was less fun because it's just not as fun anymore for several reasons like dying once or twice and the round is over, etc. but over the past couple of days I would reach for competitive more and more often because the games are actually longer like I want and this not only made me have more fun than I had before, this has solved a long time problem that I had with avoiding playing competitive and caring too much about my rank. Now I'm losing and not really getting that angry like it would ruin my day before quicker play started.

Why I dislike Season 8,"I have never been so frustrated with this game ever before, but this season has started the stress i have been receiving as of late.

First it was the start of the Mauga meta. Every game you either had to play auga or you would lose the game. Or if you beat the tank in a team fight, it would be an instant swap to mauga causing you to, Again, Swap to mauga.

Then the mid season patch comes, they buff sombra, sojourn, orisa, and lifeweaver.

 ""so now you can't have fun. Hahah!"" -blizzard executives

Tank and Dps still feel awful to play when everything you do gets out damaged or outhealed by supports. It is constantly tiring and annoying to play characters like Reaper or Roadhog, only to be instantly killed or denied any value by characters like Ana, Bap, and Kiriko. (I would say zen but he has went through enough + im a zen main)

Along with this I've been finding a whole lot more throwers in my games than ever. And I'm not tryna talk mean, but you got no idea how many bad players I have had recently, and I heard other players have had them as well.

Honestly I just hate this season cuz of the whole buffs and nerfs. Yall buff orisa n sombra, but you nerf hog? Ik the hog nerf wasn't big but it's just the thought of them Buffing Orisa but Nerfing Roadhog that sickens me.",Overwatch,1705547807.0,t3_199g4pk
Why can't Genji be any good?,"**GM 5 Take. I'm almost a Genji One Trick, 800+ Hours.**  
I just don't understand why. Genji has been Awful/Bad/Mid since his nerfs at S1. Everyone and even Blizzard says to us ""We want Genji in that spot, he is fine."" Don't get me wrong, Genji is not BAD. But he is NOT FINE either, it is a complicated case, i'd say.  
What makes Genji Mains(me included) feel bad/weak about him, is his Effort-To-Value ratio. I mean, i summed up, i can have like 650 dedicated into this Hero and still be in Diamond/Plat, while someone can have 1/3 effort/mechanical skill i do, get 3x the value i get and get GM maining other Heroes.  


Now with that explained, lemme ask something to you rq. Do you think when Genji was S Tier, before his nerfs, he was too annoying? There was a lot of people complaining that ""Genji was good""? Do you think Dive Meta is unfun to play with/against?  
Cause i don't, and i think most of the players also do not. I've heard from A LOT of Players, Streamers, Pro Players, Friends that the most FUN META is the DIVE META.   
So why people think Genji needs to be nerfed into the ground? He is a dive character. He has a high skill floor and high skill ceiling, so it's not like ""Uh, braindead character good, not fun"" No, Genji has to know what hes doing to confirm kills and make space, it is just a HARD Character being FUN and GOOD. That's all.  


We have a lot of characters that has been META SINCE THEIR RELEASE, we have characters that HAS NOT BEEN ANYTHING BUT INSANE SINCE THEIR RELEASE!  
Kiriko has not been bad a single Season in this game. Sojourn was hard meta and somehow GOT BUFFED. Ana, Bap, Illari, good since their release. Orisa gota a unnecessary buff rn, etc...   
Genji has easy counters and it's so easy to deal with him. All his counters got buffed since he got his HUGE NERF, poor boy? Symmetra, Zarya, Torb, Mei, Moira, Brig, they all got buffed since S1!

- Split up the Change of Pace challenge into 4 separate ones: 15 games of Mystery Heroes, 15 games of Deathmatch, 15 games of Arcade, and collect 4000 emblems in Hero Mastery.
- Change Role Mastery to count for any normal 5v5 mode including Mystery Heroes and some Arcade modes.

Overwatch character concept (healer) Sanguis,"(this was og back in overwatch 1 idea i made, but my audience wants me to post it on reddit) XD so if some abilitys seem off or like they already exist in overwatch now, that is why XD  
 

I loved Blame the controllers character concepts and wanted to make one of my own. I will follow the same idea (with a little less art or alot)

Hero Creation Method: 

Create an interesting ability and build around that. 

Goal for Sanguis

1: Create a 300 hp healer

2: Healing must be based off of damage 

3: be able to peel for her supporters or other allies. 

Sanguis, Talons combat ready healer, Ready to stand and fight or peel for allies. Why fight back when they hurt themself fighting us? Sanguis (concept) originally followed under mercy. Seeing her ways and taking notes. She knew mercy had a dark past and she refused to let anyone, even her friends know about it, even enough to push some away causing Sanguis to find her own answers. 

( selfish and selfless ) Left click and right-click selfish and selfless, selfish restores Health to the user using it, deals 40 damage a second while healing 20 and  selfless restore 40 HP per second stealing half from your own hp, up to half of your HP. you have 300 HP. Red effects come in and out when sucking life from your foes and healing from your allies.

Teather (e): Grabs the target and stops them from moving at full speed (50% movement speed reduction. During this time you cannot use your primary abilities (selfish-selfless). This ability lasts 2 seconds with a 8 second cd (has a 15 yard range activation distance)

(Charmic trap) shift: She puts down a trap that connects with the first foe to walk into it. If thrown again it replaces the first one. It causes no damage but when the attacker deals damage they take 20% of the damage dealt. It lasts for 4 seconds when triggered. It leaves dark red splotches on the person's screen indicating it's on them as it washes off. It has a 6 second cd and recharges after it is thrown out. It has a larger hitbox then junkrat's trap equaling a 2 meter size. 

Ultimately voiceline ""we all die as one "" 

The Ultimate has 2 effects: 

1 : creates a Winston bubble size sphere which shares HP between all Allied players within it to the percent of the lowest player. example;  Anna is at 50 HP and Baptiste is at 150 HP, each of their HP pools go to 100 every ½ second. 

2 : This heals 200 per second divided up per person in the ultimate. (if 2 people are in it, it heals 100 per second, if 4 it heals 50 per second. This ultimate lasts 5 seconds 

(It is blood red and not blue like Winston's bubble. It emanates around Sanguis and when someone is injured you see red particles fly between all the allies in the zone fixing the injured allies.

Passive: when your abilities are in effect you heal 10 per second (ability not primary or secondary)   


please feel free to tell me how to change it if its horrible XD ",Overwatch,1705544911.0,t3_199f50g
What are the best Overwatch Skins? #5 Brigitte,"I'd argue that Brigitte probably has one of the best skin catalogs of any hero. And I'd argue that it is because she is just very easy to make good skins for. She is a woman plated in armor with a mace and shield, which is already a pretty generic template to design skins for. And to Blizzard's credit, they do find a lot of good ways to reskin Brig and add to what she already is. 

Azure Drake does a fantastic job putting Brig in a more ""Fantasy"" aesthetic, and I'd argue is one of her best fantasy skins. Riot Police, despite my distaste for it, does do a good job dressing her up as a part of the police force as I think it fits her pretty well. Mechanic also does a good job expressing how good she is with machines. Her father is Torbjorn, and so I find it very cool that her intelligence and tech-savvy part of herself is expressed in this skin. And Antifragile BB works pretty well as a way to cast Brig as part of a K-pop band.

And while all of these skins are very good and really well executed, nothing compares to ""Sol"" Brigitte. And the reason why is simply because the skin fits really well with her aesthetic. Brigitte to me reads as a stoic warrior ready to aid her allies, and what better way to express that than to put her in some shiny paladin armor? The skin itself is also very well-detailed and does a good job reskinning her weapons to fit the fantasy aesthetic.

Enable mouse and keyboard support for console and add input based matchmaking,"This does not mean anyone on PC would be using aim assist or anything. This also obviously won’t solve the xim problem, as those players would still want to play in the controller pool to keep their cheating advantage.

But still, why not? Both the PS5 and Xbox series x/s support mouse and keyboard input natively. Many games, including some activision games, allow it. Controller players on PC would have an advantage over console players because they can have 300 FPS, sure. I don’t think that’s a good argument against allowing them to play in the console pool, but you can even just make it 1 way for fairness if you want (meaning console players with mnk can play on PC, but no PC players can play in console pool, regardless of input).

I don’t see any reason why you wouldn’t at least enable mouse and keyboard support for console and let them play in PC lobbies. Keep in mind that this isn’t some impossible new and expensive thing for blizzard to do. This is already a thing for MW3 and warzone. Any argument about these players being bad also means you shouldn’t let people on PC with <=120fps play the game either.

Silly Players,"For a group that loves to complain about supports, you folks sure don't try to shoot at them ever, even to pressure them into another position. If I play DPS, I pretty much don't get to play the game. If I am playing support, I not only don't die but pretty rarely get shot AT. 

Now I know I know, ""LeT mE wAlK bY tHe TaNk AnD 2 DpS tO dO tHaT"". I'm not saying you can do that, but I am saying that when I die as support, it is usually because at least one person realizes their guns have bullets that shoot further than their arms can reach and aim for me in the back line. 

Just some food for thought.",Overwatch,1705535938.0,t3_199bw6w

They also both have a charge and a damage mitigation type ability. Could also be a correlation between the flamethrower breath and Mauga setting people on fire. Moji just isn’t a tank.

Is there somewhere I can see overwatch server status to see if people are frequently disconnecting? I keep disconnecting for no reason and don't want to keep getting hit with losses,"The past few hours have seemed really bad with people disconnecting almost every match.

I didn't get hit with it until my last 2 matches. One match I was literally 5 seconds away from an easy win and i get disconnected and can't rejoin - probably because it already ended.

Is there somewhere where you can see if people are disconnecting a lot? I'm not talking about something like [downdetector.com](https://downdetector.com) as the servers are technically not down, it is just one of those days where there are so many disconnects you can't have a normal game.

On brighter side of things we like about OW2...,"On brighter side of all things OW2, I really like that hero progression tracks different stats/things for every hero, so in a long run you can actually kinda infer somebody's or your own playstyle, based on what level you are on each stat.

I'll bring screenshot of my Reinhardt for example, because 1, he is my main ""main"" and 2, I really like the story that this screenshot, and these numbers progression always, tell you about how I play. I'm a data/numbers guy, and I love this shit!

https://preview.redd.it/a6l54cib72dc1.jpg?width=3440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2bf42ef98b8056b8b596d4e9d48e3d0affbc488

I'm an ""aggressive"" but ""good""(ish?) Rein and it comes with its goods and bads!

So the highest stat is, def obviously if you played w me, Charge Pins; it's my strongest suit. I do predictive charges often and often successful! It's my special Rein sense or something and it's totally MY Rein's main thing to notice. Then comes Damage Mitigated and Time Played, kinda going hand in hand; which makes sense, its basically your shield uptime and your beefiness which is your function as a tank and thus comparable with time played. Then it goes to Damage Dealt and Shatter Stuns; this I guess means my damage falls a little behind. but shatter stuns being in my top 5 stats also makes sense; since I usually get big shatters (but sometimes not so well-timed, which is why my shatter kills is my lowest stat, but before getting there..) . Next up is Fire Strike Hits and Wins. Fire Strike Hits makes sense; I pretty much use it on cooldown and sometimes not throw the best ones. Wins being 98 compared to my Time Played being 114, is kinda your win percentage; its not great for me here, but its decent. Then in the end is Weapon Kills and Shatter Kills. I was surprised to find Weapon Kills here; this means I dont use my hammer too much. This screenshot was a few weeks ago and this for example was a good note for me to increase my hammer swinging! And last is Shatter Kills, which I guess makes sense since sometimes I get over excited and hit a 5 man shatter, only then to realize my whole or most team is dead... I know; its a problem.. but therefore, high Shatter Stuns count but low Shatter Kills count.

And Voila! You can literally find my strengths and weakness by looking at that screenshot or opening Progression at any moment. You can use this to find your weak points and focus on those; or to exploit your strong points. 

Anyways, its a cool little thing. I like it!",Overwatch,1705526223.0,t3_19980rr

It’s impossible to believe Overwatch is set 60 years after 2016.,"
I was just getting out of a match in Overwatch 2 and I’ve started to think about it. I’ve been playing the first game since the year it came out back in 2016, and I do know for a fact the devs at one point said that the events of the game takes place approximately 60-70 years into the future. How, exactly?

Flying cars, flying airships, floating areas and the fact that they use this weird, levitational technology on objects with wheels but it seems that the wheels are just designed for show. It’s just hard to believe that the lore takes place 60 years after 2016. I mean, 60 years? Seriously? It seems at least 200 years with all these designs and vehicles etc. I don’t think after 60 years our world would gorgeously look like that.

I’ve always been fascinated by the lore of Overwatch, I think it has such an amazing and interesting universe.

And one of the things that fascinates me the most is the fact that the Arabic language exists in this world, I am Arab myself and seeing an Egyptian character like Ana is so so amazing! Her lines and speaking dialogues are 100000% spot on and it is EXACTLY how modern Egyptians sound today. Not just her voice, even her words in Arabic are just so precise and native. I find it amazing how blizzard truly outdid themselves in terms of getting an Arab person to voice her perfectly. Aysha Selim did such a tremendous job!

Not only do I like the fact that Arabic exists, but it’s so cool to see a woman having a history of being a soldier turned general in the Egyptian military. Today in Egypt, only men are enlisted to be combat or war soldiers in the Egyptian army, armed forces only accept women as civil workers or specialized officers outside of combat missions. A woman in Egypt now can get enlisted as a registered nurse for example, or a medical officer, but not as a combat soldier.

This is why I find it impossible that it’s set only 60 years into the future. I think it’s WAY into the future. I don’t see women being finally permitted to enter the military in Egypt in 60 years from now a plausible or even a convincing possibility. I might be wrong, but as an arab who knows Arabic societies very well, I just don’t think it’s believable.",Overwatch,1705517809.0,t3_1994h7q

I don't think genji needs much of a buff but I do think he should have a small one,"Whenever I play genji I always end up nose deep in the backline or backing off entirely, this is due to one thing, reflect.

I think reflect should be resource based without a cooldown between uses but a bit of time to recharge and if you run out it's a long cooldown

That'd make genji easier to dive in without worry because your sustain isn't a one time use, this would also make it harder to bait but easier to overwhelm.

mauga rework idea,"ok so i see that mauga is too annoying to fight so i have come up with a rework idea for him

 so first i thikn they should remove both of his guns and replace them with pharah rockets. he can shoot 5 rockets a second with both guns but if you shoot both the spread increases and he shoots 10 rockets a second. this removes his fire and crit dmg while making him still good. he has 100 ammo 

then i think they should  remove his cardiac overdrive and instead give him a nano boost type ability. so he heals 400hp and gets 40% dmg reduction and 40% dmg boost for 5s and the cooldown is 10s

then i think they should remove his running ability. i think they should replace it with a genji dash. he will go 20m in 0.1s and it will do a 100 dmg aoe. with 8s cd but it resets everytime he gets a kill

then his ult is annoying so i just make it so that instead of locking everyone in a cage mauga will activate his ult and then he will do a pharah barrage that goes through walls. so you cant use cover against his ult

i think they should also remove all of his hp but give him 500 shields and every second he generates 30 overhp even while taking dmg capping at 500 overhp",Overwatch,1705516023.0,t3_1993qdd

Because of Junkrat's HARD HARD counters, you're basically just trolling if you use him. 

I don't think he needs a buff, but he does need a rework on his frustrating and one sided playstyle. I've had my fun with it, carrying games and all but sincerely most of time it was solely because of people not even trying to counter me with like a Zarya, Pharah-Mercy, Widow, etc.

Discussion about FPS cap,"So I have a question about capping your fps and its been a question for a long while, my means by capping is having the most minimal latency while having no possible drawbacks.

I am atm running uncapped and my fps doesnt go below my monitors refresh rate which is 165hz, my fps can fluctuate between 200-300 depending on what is happening in game.

Coming to the question, is it worth to find out your average fps and capping it to that and not letting it fluctuate so hard? Would it give more consistent results by having a consistent delay instead of it going up and down?",Overwatch,1705512413.0,t3_19926fz

OW2 CORE Problems? 5v5 or 6v6? Support 👩‍⚕️ > DPS ⚔️> Tank 🛡,"Since Devs teased a little (yet controversial) change to the game, let's discuss is it really THAT bad, or community is just overreacting?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/luo4lal921dc1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a282b6224d4c1e60939e704d311b7504ea01cdea

# 1. It's a TEAM BASED GAME

One of the main reasons of mass hate is that everyone out of sudden felt the TeAm SpiRiT in OW2 and got offended that their role (supps) is irrelevant now since there's self-heal for everyone. Let's be honest:

* **Team Based Idea is gone** when OW became 5v5 FPS. One tank is not enough to protect their team properly, now everyone survives as best they can. Second tank was always there to peel or do some flanking engagement when the other was shielding, so the rest of team were REALLY busy doing their respected role jobs. DPS were focusing on doing dmg, supports were pumping heals and E's to enable their tanks. THIS is where team based factor of game was thriving. Other question is was it good?
* **6v6 or 5v5?** 6v6 was incredibly team based but also very stagnant and boring. The amount of shields, cc abilities, GOAT... On the other hand there's 5v5, more amusing, dynamic but self-centered gameplay where any mistake of single player can drastically impact on the final outcome. Each has their own pros and cons. Frankly, it's hard to find a silver lining, and everyone might prefer one or another style (Maybe 5.5 v 5.5 would do better). This is where the core problem lies.
* **Comm Problems**. People point at 'team beased' feature but tend to play with randoms, w/o mic, refusing to switch to counter picks preferring their mains... I mean, guys, be real with yourself. If you're not playing with group of 5 chatting in discord and discussing comp and doing callouts, please, don't stutter about TeAmWoRk. Other than that is just a improvised adaptive play style, where no one switches and blame others anyway.

&#x200B;

# 2. TANK, DPS, SUPPORTS whining complaints

* **TANKS**. Since there's only 1 tank, the first thing is it's UNfun for tanks to experience the game. While other roles can compensate weak parts of their collegue, tanks DON'T have such privileges. They have to switch to counter or to adapt to their own team. Thus, they usually forget about maining DVA or Ball, and switch to counter tank. Second part of the problem is that they strongly rely on other 2 roles, while these roles don't actually care since their high mobility and sustainability. Overall tank experience is great, if you ignore the fact of winning games and protecting your team. Core problem of tanks is the absence of 2nd tank to comfort their playstyle.
* **DPS**. Universally, this role is in optimal state, except maybe some horrible ultimates and overall obsolete ability kit. Main problems of the role lies in the other role (yes, supports). All they can do, supports can do better (most of them), and additionally they can heal, survive, safely disengage. Why you gotta be precise Widowmaker, search for good spot, have 175 hp when there's Kiriko that pops out of nowhere, cleanses your venom mine, two taps you in close distant, parcour the f outta there and then heals herself. Not to exaggerate, but it do be like that sometimes. But actually, it's not even supports' fault, the same reason is that they were designed in 6v6 game mode, and they were mostly busy healing 2 tanks rather than dealing dmg by themself.
* **SUPPORTS**. The problem of this role is that it's 2 edged sword. You either give them powerful abilities so they can survive against crazy DPS role and be immortal, or weaken these abilities but they become easy prey and useless. Non of these changes will make everyone satisfied, buff Supps = DPS and Tank cry, nerf Supps = Useless supps cry. Again, problem is in the lack of 2nd tank to protect them. The Supports role itself hard in OW2 since they have to manage a LOT of things at the same time: to heal, to save, to do dmg, to survive themselves, and everyone blames them at the end. So we got high sustainable heroes that deal (not as good as DPS, but still) decent damage, but the main reason they're good at duels with DPS is their survival abilities that give them extra lives to cover their mistakes.

&#x200B;

# 3. Changes to numbers are not enough!

People HAVE to understand that the sole number tweaking is not enough. There still will be balance problems, some heroes will be thriving, while other gotta be in F-tier.

There should deffinetely be changes, CORE changes to the game. Since the heroes and gameplay initially were designed in 6v6 environment, it's clear now that some roles are hardly fitting in present 5v5 state. They're either OP or trash.

&#x200B;

# 4. SOLUTIONS

In my opinion EVERYONE should have a great and fun experience in game\*, EACH role. You have to stop being egoistic one-role trick main, and think about other people and roles.\*

*Here are some fast ideas of how to solve the role balance problem (just author's ideas):*

&#x200B;

* **TANKS** should get increased base movement speed. Reduced incoming critical hit damage. (These might be good for tank's self survivability, and making them potentially dangerous to get closer)
* **DPS** should get small self healing passive and increased damage boost when they're under 30-40% of their health.
* **SUPPORTS** should agree that their current state is unhealthy for game, but to leave it that way Blizzard HAVE to buff other roles passive.
* Implement new core game feature **""Ult exchange""**. The idea is that every player can exchange uncharged ult-bar points to get some boosts. Limited to 3 times per match, and increasing in cost after each use. Each role has unique boosts when using:-
* &#x200B;

1. Tank. Have their HP immediately healed up to 300\~400 hp-

* 2. DPS. Boost their damage by 10\~20%-
* 3. Supports. Increase their speed of movement and CD reduction timer.

For people that would say it's imbalanced, again, it reduces ULT bar points percentage based, in exchange for such boosts.

Victorian era Widowmaker,"Greetings OW community 

This is my concept art for a Victorian era skin. 

Widow is my second entry for this concept idea.

Below is the description of the skin. Please let me know what do you think? Thank you

""In the enigmatic alleyways of gaslit Victorian streets, emerges the mysterious figure known as Widowmaker, a haunting presence with a steampunk allure. Clad in ornate attire that seamlessly melds the opulence of the Victorian era with the intricate aesthetics of steampunk, she is the embodiment of elegance and lethality.

Widowmaker's eyes, once filled with life, now glow with an otherworldly intensity as she peers through the lens of her infrasight. This advanced optical device, a masterpiece of steam-driven engineering, grants her the ability to pierce through shadows, revealing the secrets hidden within the murky corners of her surroundings.

Her weapon of choice, a steam-powered rifle, echoes with the hiss of escaping steam as it readies itself for a deadly shot. 

Adorned with brass embellishments and intricate clockwork mechanisms, the rifle embodies the fusion of Victorian craftsmanship and futuristic innovation. 

Each pull of the trigger unleashes a precise burst of steam-driven power, leaving her adversaries ensnared in a deadly dance of gears and shadows.

Widowmaker moves with a haunting grace, her every step echoing the sophistication of a bygone era. The cobblestone streets bear witness to her silent approach, as she navigates the labyrinth of gears and contraptions that lie concealed beneath the surface of the Victorian world.

A figure shrouded in mystery, Widowmaker traverses the delicate balance between the elegance of the past and the enigmatic power of the future.

 In this steampunk-infused Overwatch universe, she is the embodiment of a bygone era's allure, a lethal enforcer weaving her destiny through the intricate tapestry of time and technology.""",Overwatch,1705507656.0,t3_19903zk

I didn't play much more Widowmaker after that until recently and  I just had the bug happen again. I played Widowmaker a few more times to see if this was consistent, and it was.

So what’s the incentive or thing to work towards if I don’t have the battle pass or play comp?,"If I don’t want to spend money for the battle pass, or the battle pass has nothing that interests me there’s nothing to work towards there. 

If I play a certain character and want a skin I have to pay for it now instead of overtime being able to purchase it. 

I don’t see a reason to play comp cause still many matches seem to be either steamrolled one sided matches, not all and it has improved since launch but still enough to where I don’t want to work towards it just to gamble each time if this match will be like that or not.

Aside from still enjoying the core gameplay there’s really no incentive for anything (in my opinion) 

I miss Overwatch 1, the loot boxes cause I feel like I’d actually get some reward, 6v6 for the reason of having a group before and now having to leave someone for QP or comp.

What if Iggy became a playable character?,"So, I posted yesterday a question what future heroes you'd like to have in the game. I mentioned I'd like Iggy because she has a very good character design (imo), although I haven't read the London calling comic yet. My understanding of her is that she is a leader of sort for the Omnics in King's Row, but also that she has taste for rock themed music.

I did my own concept of what her kit could look like as I was bored. However I do think it's unique and may fit her character while provide good value to the team.

Name: Iggy

Health: 200

Armor: 25

Weapon: Dual sidearm

Ammo: 15 rounds per sidearm (30 in total)

Weapon damage: 10 per hit (20 if both sidearm hit)

Role: Dps

Ability 1: [60's punk] Iggy amp up her music, increase her reload speed and movement speed with 10% and gains a +7,5hp/s for 6s. 
Cooldown: 8 seconds 

Ability 2: [Electro-rock] Iggy charge her dual sidearm for 7s, each shot deal electric damage which deal 5dmg/s for 3s. As well increase her rate of fire with 5%. She deal 1.3% extra dmg against shields and -0.5% against armor.
Cooldown: 11 seconds 

Ultimate: [Rock 'n' Roll] Iggy create an 10m shockwave which grants her and nearby allies +300 overhealth for 4s, as well increase Iggy's damage x2 for 6s. 

Now I am not very skilled enough to understand the game and all. However with what knowledge I have and what I believe would make a interesting and new gameplay experience for a new hero. I think it could be a fun concept. What do you think of this?",Overwatch,1705502539.0,t3_198y37i

Doomfist Buff?,"TL; DR
Power Block gains knockback resistance. Empowered Rocket Punch gains additonal DoT. Rising Uppercut readded weaker and on a long cooldown.

**To clarify, Seismic Slam and Meteor Strike stays the same, they aren't removed.**

**Power Block**

Any negative status effect received in the state will be applied with half the potency. You sleep or get stunned half as long, you get knockback half as much, among other status effects.

Using Power Block leaves Doomfist in a vulnerable position to receive a javelin in the face, slept, anti-ed, pinned, hooked with other miscellaneous effects. So having additional CC resistance would put Doomfist on par with every other tank which can block CC, with a few exceptions being able to heal themselves instead.

Being the only defensive ability for Doomfist as a tank, it is lackluster. Being CCed out of Power Block usually results death.

**Rocket Punch**

Empowered Rocket punch will deal an additional 20-80 damage depending on charge, over 4 seconds to the first enemy it hits which doesn't include blastback.

The additional damage is capable of dealing 200 damage in total, with a fully charged empowered punch, assuming that they do not get healed over the time of 4 seconds which is an unlikely case and rather should be used as extra damage to help secure eliminations on isolated targets in conjunction with his other damage sources.

It also gives more fear and consideration into playing around his empowered punch as current players don't really care about the difference between a normal and an empowered punch.

**Add Rising Uppercut**

Just the original Rising Uppercut but with no AOE, 30 damage and on a 14 second cooldown, alternatively it can share the same cooldown as Rocket Punch instead. The ability can be bound to reload or jump to prevent too many abilities like in the case of the release of Lifeweaver.

Being the mobile tank Doomfist is, he gains unorthodox strengths and weakness. Less blocking damage for the team, more disturbing and reaching enemy backlines. It is not intended to be a vertical Rocket Punch, rather a tool to traverse the map or in niche cases hold a singular target in place for a short time to get some damage in with Hand Cannon and of course gain minor overhealth.

A necessity or not, a good number of Doomfist players would welcome the additional option in their gameplay. The avaliability of Rising Uppercut should be limited as giving him too much mobility and disruptive ability will make it not great for enemy player experience.

**Conclusion**

While it may be true Doomfist's ultimate is weaker compared to his tank counterparts, where other tanks have ultimates which can change the course of the game, Doomfist has the ability to change the course of the game with his 3 abilities alone, or at least that's how I think he is intended to be.

These changes would likely make Doomfist strong, but I hope that my concepts does not make him oppressive. **Just a fun post by me on what could've been.**",Overwatch,1705490269.0,t3_198u9tc

thank you r/overwatch and r/cow,"the communities on r/overwatch and r/Competitiveoverwatch have meant so much to me. i just wanted to sign off one last time and thank you for all of your inspiration, shared stories and highlights, feedback, criticism and comradery. 

&#x200B;

whenever i think about the reddit communities, i always think of r/Overwatch as ""timmy"" (aka punch kid): bright-eyed, optimistic and r/Competitiveoverwatch as ""brian"" the slightly jaded older brother who realizes in the end that he actually loves overwatch but just kind of forgets it along the way sometimes...

&#x200B;

either way, you're amazing and you made my career better. you made me a better designer and game director.

&#x200B;

please take care of the overwatch team. they are wonderful, caring, brilliant people and they need you right now.

Blizzard please do not treat any heroes in the future like you have with Sombra,"**Note:** To those coming from /r/all user /u/Panromir gave this quick summary if you're unfamiliar with the situation
>To everyone coming from /r/all (where this is #1 right now):

>Blizzard have started a so called ARG (Alternate Reality Game) teasing a new hero for their game Overwatch. In that ARG the hero ""hacked"" the blizzard forums leaving clues that the players could decode. Overall that was a fun experience.

>Now they left those who followed the event a website (amomentincrime.com) with a very slow going countdown that ended today (after several weeks). At the end of the countdown we got: Nothing. People here are fed up.


Let me start by saying some of the ARG stuff is cool. Like the website or small hints in game. However all this Sombra ""hype"" has reached a point where I'm completely sick and tired of hearing about her. Sure, I'm excited for a new hero. But at this point Sombra has become more of a meme than an actual character. And nothing they introduce with her will be able to live up to the, frankly frustrating, amount of hype she's been given. It seems like every time we're FINALLY going to see a release, it turns out to be yet another teaser.

I guess the short answer is I'm sick of hearing about her. And if this is how every hero is going to be treated from now on, I worry every character will be released to disappointment rather than excitement. 

EDIT: Only 20 minutes in and this has already hit number 36 on /r/all. I tweeted this link to the Overwatch twitter, hopefully they'll take this as notice that this has been a horribly handled hero release and maybe we'll get hero reveals more like Ana in the future.

EDIT 2: Annnd number 1 on the front page of /r/all. I think that's all the proof Blizzard needs.

Also a kind stranger gave gold and I felt their message was just too good to keep for myself:

> ""I really really hope someone at Blizzard reads your post. You've said what most of the community is thinking, and hopefully Blizzard won't do this again. With the way Blizzard is treating her, Sombra better be able to shoot lasers out of her ass and turn aluminum into gold.""


**Final Edit**: So I've gotten an inbox full (about 45+ PMs) of people asking me why this post is being massively downvoted. At one point it was up to 11k and now it's half that. My best guess is that once it hit the front page it got hit with bots or something to that effect. It really does not bother me that this post is losing fake internet points. I think the point has been made and hopefully Blizzard heard it! Please don't send me any more messages about the downvotes, thanks!",Overwatch,1476818379.0,t3_585qsj

Blizzard we have 24 heroes now....,"12v12 deathmatch. Large scale arena. I'm thinking a nice circular map with a lot of open space in the center for some intrigue and a more cluttered/covered outer ring. 
  
Edit: **Wow gilded *five* times. Thanks everybody I'm so glad that I was able to provide a discussion we all feel passionate about. I love this community. We all love this game and we all want it succeed so we can keep on playing!! If you are reading this edit, keep talking about this game! Keep discussing how things can improve and what changes you like or would like because this game is worth it (Side note I wasn't trying to spark a revolution here just inspire more discussion). We are a component to this game's life. The developers have made that very clear. Thanks again!**  
I think this discussion proves that there is definite interest in larger scale matches and/or larger scale elimination matches. CTF was a success (even if it isn't a game mode added to the rotation of Quickplay or Competitive). Its something that we can enjoy in the game because the community responded so positively to it. Adding even a 6v6 deathmatch or maybe, in the future, an 8v8/10v10/12v12 match option seems to be what people want or at least what a large majority want.
As a lot of posters have said, some PCs probably would not be able to handle something so large scale. However, this is a niche mode that has a lot backing by the community and I think we would all like to see Blizzard give it a try.  
Personally, I'd love to see a mode where each and every hero comes to play in one match. ",Overwatch,1489075850.0,t3_5yfx06

&nbsp;


####Bug 4.

The Bouncy Bug - Introduced with the Mercy/Dva rework patch. Doomfist bounces off the walls and misses his target which he aimed for, usually resulting in death.

Examples:

* 4.1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWy_YdBml5Q&t= - Extensive testing and showcasing.
* 4.2 https://youtu.be/hBHIYM0pHpA?t=459 - bounced by the left wall
* 4.3 https://gfycat.com/EnviousClosedAsiansmallclawedotter - In-game
* 4.4 https://gfycat.com/ImpossibleThatAdouri - In-game
* 4.5 https://gfycat.com/DapperInformalAtlanticbluetang - DF bounced off the wall on the right

* 4.12 https://gfycat.com/ImpartialInfamousCrow - bounced vertically from the table
* 4.13 https://clips.twitch.tv/NurturingDarlingYakinikuStinkyCheese


&nbsp;



####Bug 5.

Rocket Punch Stun Ignore - some characters like zarya and reaper can sometimes activate their shift midway through the punch knockback.

Examples:

* 5.1 https://clips.twitch.tv/SarcasticSmilingFloofTheRinger - Reaper. Activates the shift miliseconds after being punched, when the stun should be still active. Even if we assume he did it after the stun, which doesn't ware off that fast, but lets assume, the wall splat animation was played. If he was in shift, why did the splat animation got played? if he wasn't in shift when it played, why didn't he take any damage? no matter how you look at it, makes no sense.
* 5.2 https://clips.twitch.tv/VibrantSneakyClipzItsBoshyTime - Zarya
* 5.3 https://gfycat.com/ShamelessKindlyFanworms - going through it frame by frame, moira gets hit by RP, slams into a wall and plays the splat animation, but shifts afterwards and takes no damage from the wall splat.
* 5.4 https://clips.twitch.tv/StupidHedonisticSwallowOptimizePrime - genji uses dash after his supposed death


&nbsp;


####Bug 6.

Delayed Rocket Punch - Doomfist just stops midair for some duration of the rocket jump instead of going forward, or the full duration of it.

Examples:

* 6.1 https://gfycat.com/HarmlessCheapKilldeer
* 6.2 https://gfycat.com/BiodegradableDopeyBluet
* 6.3 https://gfycat.com/WetGoldenBlackpanther
* 6.4 https://gfycat.com/NeglectedCloseChuckwalla
* 6.5 https://clips.twitch.tv/JollyNastyMonkeyVoteYea
* 6.6 https://clips.twitch.tv/AbstemiousDarkClamSoBayed
* 6.7 https://clips.twitch.tv/SleepyAgileEchidnaSeemsGood
* 6.8 https://clips.twitch.tv/BlightedGlutenFreeCodJonCarnage
* 6.9 https://youtu.be/xFx28LN8ofw

&nbsp;


####Bug 7.

Rocket punch does not break destructable objects.

Examples: 

* 7.1 https://gfycat.com/TemptingTerrificAfricanporcupine - in actual match. Slow it down at the impact moment if it isn't obvious.
* 7.2 https://gfycat.com/ImpureFeminineJenny


&nbsp;


####Bug 8.

Mei's Wall <-> RP Interaction - often rocket punch won't punch the person in front of the wall, but will hit the wall behind the person and stop.

Examples:

* 8.1 https://youtu.be/YR3vFJorg1Y?t=273
* 8.2 https://giant.gfycat.com/EveryWindingGartersnake.webm
* 8.3 https://clips.twitch.tv/ElatedFuriousAnteaterDoubleRainbow

&nbsp;


####Bug 9.

Genji's Dash <-> RP Interaction - Genji's dash ignores the stun and the knockback effect, and continues to travel until it stops by itself.

Example:

* 9.1 https://streamable.com/dlyoh - dash ignores the stun and the knockback continuing along its path
* 9.2 https://streamable.com/f5jct - genji pins himself into a wall after ignoring the punch stun and knockback, because his dash ended near a wall
* 9.3 https://gfycat.com/BlackandwhiteIllinformedBats - same as 9.2
* 9.4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6djoZxoF2s - similar to 9.1 but from genji's pov
* 9.5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdwf7bqZVFM - similar to 9.2 but from genji's pov


&nbsp;


####Bug 10.

Reinahrdt Charge <-> RP Ineraction = often Doomfist gets stunned by punching a charging reinhardt from an angle that shouldn't be considered as a pin angle for reinhard, like punching rein from a side/back.

Examples:

* 10.1 https://gfycat.com/CorruptAccurateImago?speed=0.125 - i don't even know if this is a case of ghost punch or a bug with interaction with the charge. Somehow doomfist gets pinned while hitting(didn't actually hit anything btw) rein from the back. 
* 10.2 https://gfycat.com/OptimisticIdioticBear - Doomfist gets stunned by punching a charging rein more than 90 degrees from his face



&nbsp;



-----------------------------------------------
##Seismic Slam Bugs

####Bug 11.

Seismic Slam no damage registration - when the target is in your seismic slam area of damage, it doesn't take any damage as if it didn't get hit at all.

Examples:

* 11.1 https://gfycat.com/CavernousAnxiousGossamerwingedbutterfly
* 11.2 https://gfycat.com/ImperfectFondAquaticleech
* 11.3 https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentPuzzledBulgogiBlargNaut
* 11.4 https://gfycat.com/PowerlessZestyAcornbarnacle
* 11.5 https://gfycat.com/CalculatingLegalAustralianfurseal
* 11.6 https://clips.twitch.tv/BlitheSlipperySandstormDoubleRainbow
* 11.7 https://gfycat.com/ThinBothGavial
* 11.8 https://clips.twitch.tv/DignifiedSpikyVelociraptorWOOP
* 11.9 https://clips.twitch.tv/ZanyHungryOxBatChest


&nbsp;



####Bug 12.

Seismic Slam Cancellation - Slam sometimes is randomly canceled completely and puts it on cooldown, w/o triggering the wave at all.

Examples:

* 12.1 https://streamable.com/2f28b
* 12.2 https://clips.twitch.tv/TawdrySullenSwallowBrokeBack
* 12.3 https://clips.twitch.tv/ArborealCautiousScallionCharlieBitMe
* 12.4 https://youtu.be/-XMQDBFTz_E?t=15
* 12.5 https://clips.twitch.tv/SingleZealousGrassKAPOW

&nbsp;


####Bug 13.

Instant Seismic Slam - in certain circumstances, the skill activates instantly, no honing/small jump, just isntantly, and usually for 11 damage.

Examples:

* 13.1 https://gfycat.com/IncompatibleOldFairybluebird
* 13.2 https://gfycat.com/RealisticAgreeableGreyhounddog
* 13.3 https://gfycat.com/ReliableWarpedKakapo - instant slam on the head
* 13.4 https://clips.twitch.tv/FunRepleteStarGivePLZ
* 13.5 https://clips.twitch.tv/BoredTangentialTortoiseDatBoi
* 13.6 https://clips.twitch.tv/SpineySuaveIcecreamDeIlluminati
* 13.7 https://clips.twitch.tv/HonestRenownedGalagoKeepo
* 13.8 https://clips.twitch.tv/CarefulSavoryAnacondaSuperVinlin


&nbsp;


####Bug 14.

Grounded Slam Output With Aerial Slam Indicator - often when the indicator for a honing slam appears, Doomfist does a grounded slam instead.

Examples:

* 14.1 https://gfycat.com/SolidEdibleAustralianfreshwatercrocodile


&nbsp;


####Bug 15.

Grounded Slam Output From High Altitude - happens if there is a character below doomfist, despite both being at high altitude above the ground.

Examples:

* 15.1 https://clips.twitch.tv/CalmAmazonianTriangleFeelsBadMan - Slam bugs and gives a grounded version because dva is below doomfist.


&nbsp;

####Bug 19.

Slam Crosshair ""Teleportation"" - Seismic Slam Crosshair ""teleports"" back if moved during the impact

Examples:

* 19.1 https://gfycat.com/ViciousPositiveBullmastiff - Seismic Slam Crosshair ""teleports"" back if moved during the impact
* 19.2 https://youtu.be/oG9ksWV0ooY - another example of Slam Crosshair Bug

-----------------------------------------------
##Uppercut Bugs

####Bug 16.

No Launch Uppercut - Sometimes the uppercut doesn't launch the enemy up, or in the direction you uppercut.

Examples:

* 16.1 https://gfycat.com/FairGargantuanJackal
* 16.2 https://clips.twitch.tv/LovelyOilyHorseKappaClaus


&nbsp;


####Bug 17.

Grounded Uppercut - You uppercut but don't go up. I've seen it one time.

Examples:

* 17.1 https://clips.twitch.tv/RockyJoyousTomatoSquadGoals - i don't even know how to explain it. No packet loss, no jittering, low ping. What the hell happened?
* 17.2 https://youtu.be/-XMQDBFTz_E?t=5

&nbsp;


-----------------------------------------------
##Meteor Strike Bugs.

####Bug 18.

Incorrect Ult Landing - Ult lands on an unperchable ledge despite being centered below.

Examples:

* 18.1 https://gfycat.com/DismalDiscreteAnchovy
* 18.2 https://clips.twitch.tv/MoralColdEggnogFailFish
* 18.3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icef4OXBVWo


&nbsp;


-----------------------------------------------
##Compilations

This section containt videos that compiled bugs from different categories.

* 19.A.1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aEvi9A8gB0
* 19.A.2 https://youtu.be/YR3vFJorg1Y?t=44
* 19.A.3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRMUbUD7VKY
* 19.A.4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wQC456kDvI



&nbsp;


-----------------------------------------------
##Other Bugs 

I don't even know in which category to put due to their rarity/unclarity/similarity with other bugs.

* 20.A.1 https://clips.twitch.tv/YummyPlausibleMacaroniRiPepperonis - Slam got stuck on the door somehow. Usually these kind of slams get cancelled completely, which is also a bug, but this one didn't, which isn't normal too. Doomfist shouldn't get stuck on objects.
* 20.A.2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2MZm3ox3Cs - after being uppercuted, genji can dash from midair before reaching ground, which will lock his movement until he touches ground. Not sure if bug or feature, but i'll list it just in case.
* 20.A.3 https://clips.twitch.tv/RealAgreeableFiddleheadsDAESuppy - Junkrat is unaffected by the RP while ulting. Not sure if bug or feature, but intuition tells me that junkrat should get knocked back by the punch, so i'll list it just in case.
* 20.A.4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hj2EO1k_rs - i don't know. Looks like Mercy just ignored the RP stun and knockback.
* 20.A.5 https://youtu.be/lI0nFB1FQhE - looks like a more crazy version of bug 20.A.1. Seems like slam was targeted in the back area inside the ship, but it went under and behind the ship, close to the targeted position but not on the correct side of the wall. 
* 20.A.6 https://imgur.com/a/7pkrB - looks like a case of kings row car, being hit through some object.
* 20.A.7 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2Hu-LtGB4 - using Seismic slam (E) through a teleporter sometimes causes Doomfist to come gliding out of the teleporter at the other side.
* 20.A.8 https://gfycat.com/BlankTalkativeHalibut - a very questionable hit
* 20.A.9 https://youtu.be/4Y5epzAT8gk - something really weird.
* 20.A.10 https://youtu.be/EowluaHRxIY - McCree roll + RP interaction bug

##Lowering Seismic Slam Frustration Factor

There is also one more thing i would like to address, it is not a bug, but it is a massive source of frustration. This suggestion is a tl;dr version of this thread(https://redd.it/7dru1l), where i go with a little bit more explanation.


&nbsp;


I'm talking about the situation where Slam lands directly into an enemy and completely whiffs, despite being right on top of him. I suggest making a small area around doomfist, in the point of landing, to also be considered the slam area.

Example:

* 21.A.1  https://clips.twitch.tv/DelightfulArtisticGrouseTwitchRPG

-----------------------------------------------
##Removing Inconsistency From the Shotgun

Doomfist's shotgun has a completely RNG spread, and it makes it inconsistent for no reason. The RNG is so big that it makes the shotgun have high variance in results.

&nbsp;



See this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J18bsHeoRc4

&nbsp;



RNG introduces a variance in the TTK, from 2 shots to kill to 4, which is double the shots. This is bad and leads to inconsistent results. Nobody plays doomfist atm because his bugs make him inconsistent and frustrating to play, having a built in inconsistent tool is just beyond me. There is no good reason to have this RNG, especially in a eSports oriented game. 

&nbsp;



The RNG spread should be removed and made into predetermined spread, that is always the same, with every shot.



&nbsp;


-----------------------------------------------
I will be adding more examples with time, if you have more bugs not posted here or more examples, please post and i will add it.

"There is a stupid community on PS4 who climb to just throw games and stream it. Blizzard, help pls.","I came across a kid on PS4, who gets to Diamond and just throws. Had to play with that account for two consecutive matches and it was so frustrating. He has the SAW movie like automated message which he plays at the start of a match asking one of us to leave before the timer expires else you'll lose the match. He either plays mei and door blocks or picks mercy and dies repeatedly. I followed the account and found a community which he's a part of which does just throws. I also watched the stream, on which he selects ""Prefer this player"" for the people who react to him by t-bagging or talking shit against him on the voice chat.

I've video proof, twitch channel, profile screenshot. Is there a way to report this to Playstation or Blizzard to get this account banned?

EDIT: This is the audio which he plays

EDIT2: This account which I encountered has 200hrs of total playtime on all modes together. I guess he has been doing this sometime.

EDIT3: Thanks for the gold. For the people who PM me asking their twitch id/psn, I wanted this post as a communication to Blizzard. Giving out their id means they get more attention and I don't want those idiots to feel encouraged.

This is the biggest argument i've seen and the most entitled and pathetic one. If you bought overwatch after the summer games, would you still hold this idea? Nope. You get a year of exclusivity and that's way more than enough.

**2.""I spent money trying to get this skin and blizzard is spitting in my face.""**

Nobody forced you to pay. They're cosmetics. It's not fair to keep them locked out to everyone else because you shelled out some money. Besides, if they bring back the skins they'd get lots of money. They're a company. 

**3."" The skins should retain their rarity"".**

They did, for an entire year. If blizzard allowed no way to  get them again it would be a slap in the face to most of the community.

- - - - 

TL;DR stop being entitled and go play some lucioball.

A solution to Sombra's DPS issues:,"^^^^^^^` A lot of people have complained about Sombra's DPS. Some say that she isn't supposed to win straight-up fights, that you have to use stealth and hack to gain the upper hand. That's true, but no matter how good your positioning is, she still struggles to secure kills (unless you have godlike tracking).

^^^^^^^^`
Both sides have a point: Sombra is an offense hero, and needs decent DPS. At the same time, raising her DPS overall would encourage people to play her as a skirmisher--a knockoff tracer--instead of the stealth flanker she was designed to be.

^^^^^^^^`
I think the solution is a compromise between the two views: **increase Sombra's damage to hacked targets.**

^^^^^^^^`
In the PTR, Sombra's hack cast time has been reduced to .8s, making it more reliable. This is a good start; it encourages players to flank instead of going in guns blazing. But it needs more:

^^^^^^^^`
When you hack, you've expended the element of surprise hacking instead of doing damage. Sure, they don't have access to their abilities now. But Sombra doesn't have any combat abilities *either.* **All you've done by ""outplaying"" them and securing the hack is to even the playing field: Their left click vs. your left click.**

^^^^^^^^`
So, to be a decent Attack hero, Sombra's left click needs to be able to win fights--if she has earned it. She earns the upper hand by landing the hack, just as Roadhog earns the upper hand by landing the hook.

^^^^^^^^`
If Sombra plays correctly, flanking and hacking as intended, she is rewarded with extra damage to secure kills without changing her playstyle to that of Tracer. Note that this damage increase is only for Sombra; it is not a global debuff like Discord.

^^^^^^^^`

"Mercy's changed in the last patch, but you won't ever notice","FiNAL EDIT: there is an official blizzard response somewhere in the comments, apparently it was a bug, and it will eventually be fixed, (i'm also taking this as a sign the control scheme mouse+controller is safe)
so one last time my deepest gratitude toward all of you wonderful peeps who helped  bringing this tho blizz's attention, thanks to you i'll remain able to enjoy overwatch, thank you


i'll be up front about this, this is a post relating to disability, accessibility so it will most likely apply to no one but me but i'd still like to post this

as you can guess i'm a disabled guy, normally i'm not really able to play any shooter, (or at least not in anyway decent) because i'm incapable of using wasd on a keyboard consistently or aim with a controller. but! overwatch is weird in that it allows me to use both a controller, (which replaces a keybords wasd) and a mouse (which replaces a controllers crappy aiming )in tandem because it allows for seemsless switching between input modes. that means what basically happens is the games is constantly switching between controller and keyboard so fast it registers both.

so using this weird amalgam of controll methods i have been been actually able to enjoy overwatch, usually playing mercy beaming and boosting with the mouse

however, the latest update has made it so that the game stops registering right click mouse input as soon as the controller activates.... so basically the boost beam is unusable now (unless standing still being easy pickin's ) 

i know this is extremely specific and nitpicky but i'm just afraid that if this was just an oversight  they'll eventually patch it out completely and that would mean the end of my overwatch fun

TLDR i'm disabled, thus use a really weird controll scheme that may have been an oversight and the latest patch made mercy not really playable with that scheme, and i'm kinda afraid they'll eventually patch it out completely
 
EDIT: Ok i didn't expect this kind of reaction, thanks y'all, 
i've been messing about with the options like toggle beam, played a few matches it's clunky and makes me even more inacurate ,(before this update the beam had the tendency to stick to a target sometimes and not let go, maybe this was a side effect from my weird setup) but **at least i'm able to buff again, and hey i'll take what i can get :D ** Aside from that i've been checking out other heroes with a similar button held ability (rein walking with shield, zarya's beam and symmetra's primary fire, ) and none of them have this so it's a weird mercy only thing (it seems) anyway thanks to you all and although i realise it's a bit nitpicky seeing as sticky beam (kinda solves it, i still hope its something that can be fixed, and that they don't patch this out intirely

again thanks for the support everyone",Overwatch,1490282370.0,t3_612h95

I apologize, but at this point you couldn’t pay me to play Mercy anymore, I’m sick to death of it. If you really want a Mercy to win you’re free to switch to her. You don’t want to, but neither do I. The fact that I chose a healer doesn’t make “being Mercy” my responsibility.

"After this latest example of Doomfist being adressed and fixed, It's quite clear that if you structure your post correctly and actually provide constructive feedback, You're post is a lot more likley going to get the developers attention.","Now, We've all seen the posts. **DOOMFIST IS BROKEN** or **DOOMFIST NEEDS A BUFF** that provides little to no actual constructive feedback and is structured horribly.  
  
We all saw the post made by u/iSinner_ recently, this post was well structured, with examples of every bug and how it effected gameplay along with video evidence of each bug, and presented in a way that it is easily read and is clear on what is being provided.  
  
Well, As you must have seen by now the points have been addressed and some have been fixed. However we all know the posts that said **FIX DOOMFIST** coming up everyday, but it was addressed properly when a user put time and effort into their post.  
  
**TL;DR**: If you are going to make a post on how a character needs balancing or needs bug fixes... structure it properly and provide examples of the problems, do not simply say **OMG FIX PLS**, because if you do structure your post correctly you have a **much** higher chance of your post having an impact.

"Blizzard, it's NOT fair to send out an update 5 hours before the comp season ends, forcing disconnects and -50 SR on players.","Exactly as title says.

With just 5 hours to go, I was grinding my way back to Diamond Rank before season 11 ends. Middle of the game, everyone begins disconnecting. I soon realise Blizzard have pushed out a compulsory update for D.va cosmetics in the middle of my competitive game.

We now all lose 50 SR for leaving the game, despite Blizzard pushing this loss onto us themselves.

This is not fair and completely nonsensical. Wait until the competitive season ends before you push out an update and crash the servers by advertising it all over Twitter.

Is this a rant post? Definitely. Do I want Blizzard to learn from this as it is utterly hypocritical and unfair? Yes.

We have tons of creative people in this community, so we could also do contributor cards for best Overwatch related OC like fan art, cosplay, song, or video.

We could also give out some prizes. I know it's kind of late, but it would be really cool even if its just a gift card to the battle.net store for some loot boxes. 

If it catches on, we could have much nicer prizes next year!

**Edit:**

#I have created the [[Overwatch Play of the Year Discord.]](https://discord.gg/9KpdVsT)

 Join up if you'd like to be involved in planning this event out! I sure as hell don't know what I'm doing!

Some points/suggestions from people in the comments:
-------
* Have categories for highlights so that a funny clip doesn't beat out something really unique

* Have a weekly or monthly contest so that the end of the year event next year has a smaller, but still quality pool of nominees.

* Some people are very mad that I suggested this because there are too many PotG's to choose from, and/or they don't trust the community to vote. (I don't know what you want from me. I have gold elims.)

* I agree that there a ton to choose from, so, at least for this year, maybe we should limit nominations in certain ways? Maybe people who at least have reddit accounts? Also, that they can verify their account in the nomination thread. Also, we should have a nomination thread.

* Mod's will probably have to get involved.

* a good place to start looking for [**Play of the Year might be in the /top/ tab**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/top/)  ",Overwatch,1480775058.0,t3_5g9rc4

Hello, I'm Kolorblind. I'm a colorblind Bastion player and currently ranked #1 in competitive, and was the first Bastion only account to reach top 500 with Solo Q.

I'm here to beg for a fix for the colorblind mode in this game, it's awful.

I have protonopia, which means I can't see red hardly at all- it looks gray for me.
Take a second to imagine how hard this game would be if the enemies didn't have outlines at all, just dark characters against a dark background.

It'd kind of suck wouldn't it? That's how it is for me, and it fucking sucks.

""But Kolor, this game already has colorblind support! It's in the video options, Blizzard thought of everything!""
Yes, I know, but those options fucking suck.
Why do they suck? Because they're filters, not colorblind modes.

----------------------

Here's what a good colorblind mode would do, it would change the colors of enemies outlines, UI effects, and in game effects such as Mei's ice wall, Winston's bubble, and so on.

That would be radical, and would let me play the game correctly without walking past a widow just standing against a wall because I couldn't see her.

What does the colorblind mode in this game do? It's a filter, so it changes every single color on your screen do a different color- for example, one of the colorblind modes it called the Tritanopia mode, in theory, it makes the bad guys purple, and makes the good guys a vivid green; perfect, right?

If only; because it doesn't just change the enemies to purple, it changes all red in the ENTIRE GAME to purple- meaning outlines, UI, and the entire fucking map. Everything. It also changes all blue to green, so the game looks like a totally radical acid trip.

Example: http://i.imgur.com/chG6kb1.jpg (credit to /u/minisusoend)

--------------------

Using this mode is very disorianting and chatotic, I've used it for a few months just because using the normal mode is legit impossible for me because I can't see red. I'm forced to play like this, and I hate it.
I want to see the game like it should be, I want to see the green grass and blue skies and radical skins without it being fucked up by all this purple and green. 

Not to mention it means I still have trouble because yeah, the bad guys are purple, but so is everything else in the map- so it's still hard as fuck to see them.


Blizzard, you're OW development team is fucking amazing at fixing bugs, patching up shit, and getting updates out all the time, so why have you ignored the colorblind support since launch?

I'm begging you, please at least tell us why you refuse to fix it.

I'm Deaf. Please bring subtitle for all voice lines.,"I know some of you guys may think it is distracting but it brings a viable information, for instance, a character might say ""There's a turret over there."" Or ""There's a teleport over there""... How would deaf people know?

Maybe it would be nice to incorporate voice line subtitles into Chat window. I am not saying we should have ""footsteps"" notification, most of the deaf/hard of hearing community relies visual elements and notifications in the game. 

Updated:

This started when I was playing with my hearing friend a night before I created this post. We communicated via in-game text chat. Not by voice chat.

He said my character was saying something rude about killing other people. I wasn't sure what's he talking about because I haven't said anything in the game. He said it is my voice line in the game, or it could be an automatic ""talk"" in the beginning of the game. I wasn't aware of this.... There were no subtitles in the beginning. He said few characters would ""talk"" each other, like if you have two Tracers in the match, they will say something funny to each other, etc.

Speaking of subtitles, there aren't any subtitles or closed captioned for all Overwatch short animated films, why is this? If you look at Valve, not only they started captioned all their games in Half-Life, Team Fortress. It is a shame that Valve did an amazing job than Blizzard. 

I have posted this over Blizzard support and gotten huge support.

While Blizzard is known for caring for their employees, working in such a large company is definitely hard and exhausting. Some people work in small and friendly companies, just to avoid such pressure which comes from working in large companies, with a large income. For Jeff and some others on Overwatch team, it's even more exhausting, because of the constant connection with huge playerbase. And yet they still answer to so many forum posts with positivity, and listen to our feedback.

I don't want to return to the topic Jeff vs. ""rude forum poster"". I just want to say, that while there may be some trolls or toxic people on the forum or Reddit, it's just a minority. The vast majority of the forum and r/Overwatch is kind, helpful, and we deeply appreciate what you are doing, even when we don't say it out loud, and we know how difficult your work is.

Even a terribly arrogant person like me has to say: **""Thank you Overwatch team, I love what you are doing, I'm proud of you all, and if you are feeling down, I do care.""**

EDIT: RIP inbox. I noticed that a lot of people call this a circlejerk. You are correct.

So I read through [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/9ufrbk/doing_the_maths_why_the_overwatch_world_is_in/) and saw that he was doing things wrong! Because [Duty Calls](https://xkcd.com/386/), I had to correct them, and slept no more than the recommended amount of <4 hours in the process -_-. The first day, that is (I may or may not have spent an entire week on this post, only to correct some random person on the Internet). It may also have something to do with that OP got 16k upvotes for not doing math, so i may be able to get... 7? upvotes for doing things properly.

Most calculations can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13weMik940EOIUB5eVfQVNb9hlQIHs1_dLjIOFaDCj98/edit?usp=sharing).

So anyway, what do we know?

# Measurements

My FOV is 103°, which results in an actual FOV of 90° because Overwatch is weird. My screen is 1920px wide, which makes the pixel radius 960px. I took screenshots of the Moon from Dorado and of the Earth from Horizon Lunar Colony [as you can see here](https://i.imgur.com/uiVVr4H.jpg). The Moon height over horizon from Earth was such that the moon just touched the top of my screen, so the radius is 1080/2=540px.

| Object                              | Pixel radius |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|
| Moon                                | 70.5px       |
| Earth                               | 323px        |
| Screen                              | 960px        |
| Moon height over horizon from Earth | 540px        |
| Earth height over horizon from Moon | 259px        |

We also know the radius and mass of the OW earth from [these screens](https://i.imgur.com/jpnv5MP.jpg) on Horizon.

# Pixels and angles

We are interested in the angular radii of all our objects, but we only have the sizes in pixels. So how do we convert between the two?

We can visualize the situation with [this figure](https://i.imgur.com/irDgDQM.png) where `x_o` is the pixel radius of the object, `ɑ_o` is the angular radius of the object, `x_s` is the screen radius and `ɑ_s` is the angular radius of the screen, which is half the FOV, so 45°.

If we [remember our trigonometric functions](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/imgmth/ttrig.gif), we notice that

      tan(ɑ_s) = x_s / z
    z tan(45°) = x_s
             z = x_s    (Because tan(45°)=1)

We can also use `tan` to calculate ɑ_o:

    tan(ɑ_o) = x_o/z
         ɑ_o = atan(x_o/z)

Using this formula on the known pixel widths, we get this table:

| Thing                               | Pixel radius | Angular radius |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Moon radius                         | 70.5px       | 4.20°          |
| Earth radius                        | 323px        | 18.60°         |
| Screen horizontal radius            | 960px        | 45°            |
| Moon height over horizon from Earth | 540px        | 29.4°          |
| Earth height over horizon from Moon | 259px        | 15.1°          |

Because I will use it later, also note that `cos(x + 90°) = -sin(x)` and that `sin(x + 90°) = cos(x)`.

# Where things get complicated

First of all, the symbols I’ll be using are:

| Thing                               | Symbol | Unit  |
|-------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| Moon radius                         | x      | km    |
| Earth radius                        | r      | km    |
| Moon angular radius                 | α_m    | °     |
| Earth angular radius                | α_e    | °     |
| Moon height over horizon from Earth | h_m    | °     |
| Earth height over horizon from Moon | h_e    | °     |
| Earth gravity                       | g_e    | m/s^2 |
| Moon gravity                        | g_m    | m/s^2 |
| Earth jump duration                 | t_e    | s     |
| Moon jump duration                  | t_m    | s     |
| Angle of Dorado from Moon-Earth line (see edit 2)                 | φ      | °     |
Our situation is [this figure](https://i.imgur.com/2uzYQOs.png) where E and M are the center of the Earth and Moon respectively and that D and H are Dorado and Horizon Lunar Colony ^(remember this, I will use it a lot). The lengths of `f` and `g` are derived from that

    sin(ɑ_m) = x / f
           f = x / sin(ɑ_m)

Using the [law of cosines](https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/law-of-cosines.png), we can write d^2 in two ways: using the triangles △MED and △MEH. [Moving things around](https://i.imgur.com/wpiz1Sw.png), we get a quadratic equation. Solving this equation yields the value of `x`.

Now knowing `x`, `d` is now solvable using the law of cosines on either △MED or △MEH. (I used △MED in my spreadsheet.)

All this yields the following table:

| Thing               | OW       | Real      | Ratio (Real/OW) |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Moon radius         | 1203 km  | 1737 km   | 1.444           |
| Moon-Earth distance | 16428 km | 384400 km | 23.4            |


# Acceleration, mass and gravity
The position of an object under constant acceleration is `s = 1/2 a t^2 + v_0 t`.
Plugging in the numbers at the end of the jump on Earth:

    v_0 t_e + 1/2 g_e t_e^2 = 0
          v_0 + 1/2 g_e t_e = 0  (dividing by t_e)
                        v_0 = -1/2 g_e t_e


Plugging in the numbers at the end of the jump on the Moon yields:

      1/2 g_m t_m^2 + v_0 t_m = 0
    1/2 g_m t_m - 1/2 g_e t_e = 0        (substituting in v_0)
                      g_m t_m = g_e t_e  (multiplying by 2 and adding by g_e t_e)
                          g_m = g_e t_e / t_m


Using Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Newton’s second law, we can find the mass of the moon. The only problem is that the effect of the Earth's gravity is non-neglible, and to make things worse, not pointing straight down. We can use the previously mentioned laws to calculate the strength of this force, changing the name of g in the figure to r to avoid cofusion.

    g m = G M m / r^2
      g = G M / r^2

Which turns out to be about 0.9986 m/s^2, compared to the lunar acceleration of 2.43 m/s^2, see table below. 

So if the moon's center of mass is straight down, you should accelerate slightly towards the Earth when jumping on Horizon. Since the player doesn't do that in Overwatch, Overwatch BREAKS THE LAWS OF PHYSICS. Bet you didn't see that one coming.

Anyway, I'll just ignore this force because Blizzard ignores it.

    F_r = g_m m + g_e m = G m M / d^2
           g = G M / d^2
           M = g d^2 / G

Plugging in the numbers yields:

| Thing        | OW          | Real        | Ratio (OW / Real) |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Moon gravity | 2.43 m/s^2  | 1.62 m/s^2  | 1.5               |
| Moon mass    | 5.270e22 kg | 7.342e22 kg | 0.7178     |


# The rest of the maths
Using the [law of sines](https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/law-of-sines.png), we can calculate φ, ~~the latitude of Dorado~~ the angle of dorado from the Earth-Moon axis (see Edit 2), remembering our figure:

    sin(φ) / f = sin(h_m + 90°) / d
             φ = asin( cos(h_m) f/d )
which turns out to be ~44.78756°, ~~which is around the latitude of Minneapolis, US or Bordeaux, FR. Not exactly Mexico...~~ SEE EDIT 2.

Anyway, the thing OP ~~thought~~ correctly thought was the big deal. [Tidal acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force) is calculated using the formula `2 G m r / d^3`, so calculating [the effect of the moon on the earth](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+*+G+*+5.27037e22+kg+*+\(6371+km\)++%2F+\(20325.2+km\)%5E3) and [vice versa](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+*+G+*+5.972e24+kg+*+\(1203.23+km\)++%2F+\(20325.2+km\)%5E3) yields this:

| Tidal acceleration on | OW          | Real    | Ratio of OW/Real |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| Earth                 | 5.338e^-3 | 1.10e-6 |  **4853**^(this isn't good, like really bad)           |
| Moon                  | 0.1142      | 2.44e-5 | **4680**^( this isn't good either)             |

# The effects
~~As you might imagine, the Earth will be just fine with smaller larger tides which will only result even in higher and lower tides basically the exact opposite of OP:s conclusion, but nothing on a cataclysmic level, but the tides will probably exceed 40 or 50 metres in places. So don't build on the shore in the OW universe.~~

Actually, the Earth (or at least life on it) is probably not fine. I mean, tides hundreds of metres high and way more volcanic activity, earthquakes, and more. But I don't think the result would be cataclysmic, just really, *really* bad if you live on the shore or near a volcano. 

The Moon is in bigger danger, but it will probably just result in tidal heating (albeit a lot of it) instead of something cataclysmic, but I really do not know^(^Scott ^Manley ^plz).

I spent way too much time and effort on this post, but it was totally worth it just to say that OP was slightly incorrect.

# TLDR:
The Earth probably fine even though things are really bad, but Mexico ~~is in Minnesota~~ is actually just in Mexico.

EDIT: as [/u/Ozoriah](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/9w81ld/doing_the_maths_properly_why_the_overwatch_world/e9jizcl/?context=3) (and others probably) correctly pointed out, I made a mistake when calculating the mass of the moon and not calculating the Earth's gravity. This has now been fixed and the conclusions updated.

EDIT 2: as a few other people have pointed out, you can't calculate the latitude of Dorado using this approach. The angle of ~45° that I get is the angle between the Earth-Moon line and Dorado, so Dorado could, in fact, be in Mexico. :(

One Tricking Isn't Bannable but doing this as a one trick is,"Well this one trick banning discussion started with a post by XUL here https://redd.it/7c5gvh.

He claims that the only reason he got banned was for one tricking torb. Me and my friends played with him and got steamrolled on the payload map since they were heavily countering torb.

My friend Activates picked torb on attack to see what XUL would play after we asked him kindly to swap to ANYTHING else as we were flexible on our picks.

XUL responded by saying he's just gonna afk then. Rather than picking another character and playing the game he decided he would just sit in base without picking a hero. He kept timing out and back in so he wouldn't get banned from competitive afterwards.

From his actions in this clip shown if another torb main was on the team and picked it first he would've went afk in the base and just lost the game for the team since he was unwilling to pick anything else. This is the problem with some of these one-tricks, it's not the one tricking itself, its the player. XUL got banned for griefing or delibrate inactivity.

PROOF: https://streamable.com/hh7ro

EDIT: To clarify we let him play torb on defense and got crushed as he was getting super countered. The team made an effort to play around his pick and you can see by the time on the top right it didn't work.

Jeff Kaplan's justification for the Roadhog nerf was that one shot kills were bad. Doomfist can one-hit kill 18 of the 25 heroes.,"**I do not think Doomfist is OP. I do not think Hanzo is OP. I do not think one hit kills are bad. For (what I hope is) the final time, this thread is about the inconsistency with Jeff implying that one-shot combos are bad and then leaving several others in the game. If Blizzard thinks OHKs are bad, then they should take issue with all of them. Roadhog's nerf being about his one-shot kill makes no sense.**

**The reason they gave for nerfing Roadhog isn't good. That's what this thread is about. This thread is about the double standard of allowing other frustrating one-hit kills but nerfing Roadhog into the ground and using the OHK as the reason.**

EDIT 4: Putting \^this^ straight at the top since everybody is ignoring it. I'm a little flabbergasted that despite every attempt in the OP of this thread to make that abundantly clear, I am getting literally **thousands** of responses in my inbox explaining that Doomfist is not OP and that Hanzo is not OP and that I'm an idiot because I think those heroes are OP. Heavens.

EDIT 5: Also yes, I know Roadhog is a tank and Doomfist is not (well over 1,000 comments repeating that to me). Again, not relevant to what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that there are several characters left in the game with frustrating one-shot kills/combos, and only Roadhog's was removed. And spoilers: Roadhog is now a completely useless hero because they didn't give him anything to make up for it.

------------------


> Players think that every change we make to hero has the intent of buffing or nerfing that hero. Changes to heroes are usually made to make the game better. **That’s what we were trying to do with Roadhog. Our goal wasn’t a nerf – our intent wasn’t a nerf. Our intent was to try to remove a behavior that had become “not ok” with our player base – the one-shot combo.** 

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20757706588?page=2#post-24

For proof of what heroes he can one-shot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbSUIlySac

Also as u/DarwinMoss points out, Hanzo can still OHK 21.5 heroes (.5 being zero suit D.Va!) from a distance with no risk to himself. To everybody saying that ""risk"" is the reason Roadhog was nerfed, Hanzo can scatter from a safe distance for easy one-shot kills.

**EDIT 2: Fellas, the point of this post is not that Roadhog was flawless before or that Doomfist is bad. I am not against Doomfist having a one-shot kill or combo. I do not think Doomfist is OP. I am not against one-hit kills.** My point is that when the entire justification for nerfing Roadhog into complete and utter uselessness is ""one shot kills are bad"" and then a month or two later you debut a hero built on the back of one-shot kills and combos (that heals himself when he uses his abilities), that is not a truthful reason for the nerf.

**This is not about Doomfist specifically. This is about Jeff's reasoning for nerfing Roadhog into the ground clearly being false.**

EDIT 3: Moving \^this^ to the top since everybody thinks I hate Doomfist or think one-hit kills are bad (spoilers: I don't).

I find it highly strange that the motivation of nerfing Roadhog was that the one-shot combo had become not okay with the players, and it wasn't how they wanted the game to play, only for them to turn around and immediately introduce a hero that is built on his ability to OHK high-priority targets through barriers. It's true that they need to be relatively close to a wall, but that is an extremely common occurence on most maps do to the inherent amount of walls and cover. A Doomfist player who minds his positioning can usually find the right angle to hit their target in such a way that they will hit the wall and be killed immediately.

Furthermore, the heroes who Doomfist cannot one-shot kill are the same heroes that Roadhog couldn't one-shot (with the exception of Bastion).

Where is the consistency? Are one shot kills okay? Are they not something they want in the game? Do they only want Doomfist to be able to do it?

I find it far more likely that, as many people have come to guess, that Roadhog countered Doomfist too hard so they nerfed him into the ground to make way. 

What do you guys think?

EDIT: Hog's utility was picking. Every hero has an intended utility, and since day one Roadhog's has been high-priority picking. He has never been effective as an actual tank (much like Winston, who is a great hero but not great at actual tanking), and is notorious for his lack of defense turning him into a walking ult battery. Roadhog went from one of the best heroes in the game to completely useless because they took away his utility without actually making him good at anything else. I can respect it if they want to make Roadhog into more of an actual tank and didn't like his dependency on picks, but they can't remove his only selling point without replacing it with something equally good because they say that one hit kills are bad, and then immediately debut a character who uses one hit kills and would be immediately invalidated by Roadhog.

And for all you people informing me that clearly Roadhog was never supposed to one shot and that it's not a part of his ""intended design"", I will remind you that his one-shot combo is in his trailer. They may not want him to have it now, but it was always the core part of his design and you can't just take that away without replacing it with something.",Overwatch,1501257139.0,t3_6q4okt

"If a person who is AFK at the start of the match doesn't pick a character, and does nothing until they're kicked, the match is still allowed to continue 5v6. I find that stupid.","Why are matches even allowed to happen if we have a 6th who's kicked before even picking a character?

The last game I just played we had a person who was AFK from the start. The round starts and he still hasn't picked. Eventually he's kicked but enough time has passed that the game is able to continue. Why is that even allowed to happen? 

While I was waiting for the timer to countdown so I could leave, I tried sending a message to one of my teammates, but in that 30 second process I GET FUCKING KICKED. What the fuck is blizzard doing with these AFK timers? If a person hasn't picked a character 60 seconds into the start of the match, kick them and end the match. 

Its not fair for everyone else, especially the now 5 man team, to even try

Hell, if Blizzard isn't willing to add people into competitive matches to take the place of leavers, like in quickplay, don't kick people who have already picked characters that stand still for 30 seconds. Maybe I'm contesting a point while sitting and no one sees me, maybe I'm sending a message on PSN and can't type everything into the teamchat like PC.

I'd rather have a 6 man team with one person who MIGHT start playing again than to kick a person from the team and NOT have them replaced.

**UPDATE:** Thank you guys for the responses, I didn't expect this to get so many votes, I was happy at 400 thinking people were annoyed by the AFK system too. But having 8000+ tells me there is an issue here that actually needs addressing. [Yes there are some confirmed bugs in the system getting fixed](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20753195117?page=2#post-36), but overall, things still need to change regarding leavers and AFKers",Overwatch,1485533224.0,t3_5qhx1t

My Zenyatta change. Orbs of Peace.,"Simple. Get rid of Zenyatta's right click charge up and replace it with Orbs of Peace. His orbs instead circle around him and deflect (not reflect) attacks. This consumes his ammo at a high rate. 


I felt giving Zenny mobility was against his character design but giving himself a couple moments of peace made perfect sense. This would allow Zenny to move more freely through open areas, and give him some much needed survivability. Would also allow players to choose to use ammo either offensively or defensively going well with his Harmony/Discord theme.

Tell me what you think.


Edit: Well this is weird. It seems I have no possible way to defend myself if somebody had a similar idea and claims I stole it. I understand the users frustration if he seems to think I took his idea but to me the only parts that were similar were the idea of an on demand defense based on ammo usage. That's where the similarities stopped.

I'm amused that the top comment for this idea I had became a mod sticky inciting a witch hunt but I suppose such things are sometimes unavoidable when ideas are tossed around; people sometimes have similar ones. It's really sad that the fun idea I just wanted to share became this and now my inbox is full of hate. Thanks moderators.",Overwatch,1467903034.0,t3_4roxx9

Blizzard revealed at Ana and Reinhardt's relationship as an easter egg in their skins.,"*Hi, Polygon.*

*And 1-UP.*

*jesus christ do you idiots do any actual journalism?*

Alright. This theory is going to get a bit weird, but bear with me. First of all, let's establish something: the four 'rare' skins each character have are, as a rule, based around a theme - usually their language or colors. For example:

**Widowmaker (French):**

* Ciel
* Nuit
* Rose
* Vent

**Zenyatta (The Elements):**

* Air
* Earth
* Leaf
* Water

**d.Va (Flavours):**

* Blueberry
* Lemon-Lime
* Tangerine
* Watermelon

**Junkrat (Destruction Adjectives):**

* Bleached
* Drowned
* Irradiated
* Rusted

**Genji (Minerals):**

* Azurite
* Cinnabar
* Malachite
* Ochre

---

It applies for a lot of skin groups (some are a bit of a stretch), but we can see that, generally, there's a theme. Now, let's took  at Ana and Reinhardt.

**Ana (Jewels):**

* Citrine
* Garnet
* Peridot
* Turquoise

**Reinhardt (Metals):**

* Brass
* Cobalt
* Copper
* Veridian

Okay, I hear you say. Jewels and metals, Deci. That's a bit of a stretch, isn't it?

Then let's look at Pharah's skins.

* Amethyst (Jewel)
* Emerald (Jewel)
* Copper (Metal)
* Titanium (Metal)

Ana and Reinhardt subtly flirt in their quotes and clearly have a relationship. (Ana? How could this be? I thought you were dead/You are looking as lovely as ever.) They both served at the same time, at the same age. Also, judging by official art, young Ana and young Reinhardt were pretty fine.

But, more importantly - Pharah is 50% Ana, and 50% Reinhardt. 

Ana and Reinhardt fucked, had a baby, and she inherited half of their skins, each.",Overwatch,1479896872.0,t3_5egn14
One of the top 500 players on PS4 is a well known hacker and Blizzard doesn't give a damn about it.,"I can't mention his name because it would count as witch hunting but he's a hacker who DDoS attacks his opponents and then wins the game by holding their connection down, so they are unable to rejoin to the match. He is able to do this because the PS4 system has a bug: if someone joins to your party (voice chat) you are able to get his IP. So basically at the beginning of the match he creates a party, invites all six enemy players, and if one of them accepts the invite, nukes his connection. 



After finishing the last season on 4200, his placement matches in season 5 put him to 2800, and I got to experience a match against him last night: http://imgur.com/a/IVHlg




I have lots of proof I can't post here because of the witch hunting rule, on /r/OwConsole we have posts about him almost weekly. There's video proof of him on youtube:



* threatening his teammates who decided to throw the game because they didn't want to support a hacker (everyone knows his name in grandmaster for doing this, he is like an infamous celebrity), telling them that he's going to hack their account and expose their IP's on his website 



* in another match, bragging about his hack on voice chat, saying that all enemy players accepted his party invites, and asking his teammates which enemy hero he should disconnect (a minute later he disconnects 4 enemy players).


* countless videos from different uploaders, where he DDoS attacks the enemy and makes at least one of their players leave 





And the best part: he was never banned. Not even once, he is still playing with his main account. He is doing this since march, every single day, and he hasn't received **any** punishment. On console we don't have a report system in Overwatch, and Sony tells us that we should contact Blizzard about it. 





Blizzard, what can we do about him? Me and other players sent e-mails about him, there are countless videos of him on youtube, yet, there was no action taken, and none of us got a reply to the e-mails. Cute junkrat plushies and memes get official Blizzard responses every day, but the hackers are completely ignored? Where should we report him? What should we do?

"Suggestion: Left clicking during Deadeye makes McCree shoot left to right, right clicking makes him shoot right to left, Q again cancels","I've been playing a fair bit of McCree in QP recently, and I noticed today that a lot of my deaths during Deadeye are from Genji's reflect. Now I know that is on me, but if Genji is on the right and reflecting when you left click your Deadeye, he is the first one that gets shot at.

"I met one of the Dev's at my bar, and he sent me this.","A few weeks ago one of the dev's came into my bar (I'm a bartender). He was wearing an Overwatch hat and I asked him where he got it, he laughed and said he worked for Blizzard.

I actually hold a ""goal card"" in my wallet that I made a few years ago on a particularly bad day that says, ""I will work for Blizzard Entertainment."" And has a date and my name signed. I've been holding it for years and have shown no one. 

So I showed it to him, to show that I wasn't just fanboying but I really did want to work for Blizzard, and bought him a beer. I told him I really appreciated what he did and he told me some cool insider stories, then asked for my email. I didn't expect anything, but a few days later I got this in the mail.

Looking for the Tracer I saw at IHOP after blizzcon.,"This is a long shot but if you were a tracer and were at IHOP in Anaheim tonight (November 5th, the last day of blizzcon) and I told you and your friend group the story of my friend and his love of dabbing and thus you told me of the genji dab in overwatch and we exchanged faces outside of the IHOP I forgot to ask for your number!

My blizznerds group has told me to post on the blizzcon subreddit and this one. It's also now apparently being shared on twitter as #helpkylefindtracer

I never expected it to get this big. I just thought she was really cute. 

Edit: Okay WOAH I just woke up to a lot. So to answer some questions. What I mean by exchanged faces was that as we were walking out I just straight up gave her a face, Like I probably looked like Xul from Heroes of the storm because I was so tired from the con, but she ended up making faces back at me and it was just a cute exchange nothing more, nothing less. As far as people are concerned about it being creepy and whatnot. People seem to think I need this person in my life for some reason. Truthfully I dont. I have the internet as a resource to possibly talk to someone who seemed like a lot of fun. But If I dont find them, my life is no different then it was before, people. I never thought people would find this sweet to any degree so I appreciate all of you wonderful people. I'm just glad I could bring smiles to faces. As I said before life is far to short for negative energy.

Second Edit: Okay so people are asking that I post a picture.

This is me. My Twitter picture is a picture I used for streaming. So It wasn't the best for identifying me. Some of you have already found me on Facebook.

You need to STOP immediately. We all have a right to our privacy. I am not asking you to hunt her down. The polygon article was slanderous and turned this into a perverse situation. If she wanted to contact me that is her own business. She owes me nothing. As I have stated I do not need a response. I am NOT head over heels, I am NOT infatuated. This has become sick and twisted. Thank you to those who have defended me and continue to defend me and are not twisting this into something it isn't. If you all want to rally behind something rally behind taking down that polygon article. It absolutely pushes something that I am not okay with. Women deserve our respect, If a woman says no.

Antinade makes tank un-fun to play,"Getting hit with an anti-nade is pretty much a death sentence with quite a few tanks. Getting hit by it is completely outside your control. (If you are playing Roadhog/JQ/Reinhardt/Mauga). You are doing what you are supposed to do (being a tank) and the moment you get hit by the purple juice you are pretty much done for. This is simply un-fun. Period.


I don't think it's a coincidence that Zarya and Orisa are so strong at the moment because they aren't affected to much by the all-mighty tank killing grape juice jar as their other tank counterparts.

McCree's Tumbleweed And Why Overwatch Competitive is Doomed.,"In this post, I will be covering the game-breaking crisis that is Jesse McCree's **tumbleweed**, and why it can't coexist in the competitive realm of Overwatch. It will contain factual evidence and in-depth analysis as to why Blizzard needs to alter the **tumbleweed** in some way if they have plans to surpass popular e-sport League of Legends, an MMO FPS shooter known for its fantastic game balance and friendly community.

I will begin by highlighting the facts - *The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly*. Upon declaring > It's high noon, time seems to stop as the star of this post, the **tumbleweed** springs into action and discretely wrecks havoc upon unsuspecting victims on the map. The real kicker here is that this desert variety plant's strength is masked by the revolver, who would actually be useless without the assistance of aforementioned **tumbleweed**.

Most people cry and moan over how McCree's flashbang + fan the hammer combo is what makes him op, yet underdog **tumbleweed** proves time and time again that he is a force to be reckoned with. The following clips show the effectiveness of Clint Eastwood McCree's high noon [with](https://gfycat.com/SelfreliantScentedAgama) and [without](https://gfycat.com/EnergeticOrderlyGangesdolphin) the presence of this cheeky little bugger. As you can see from the first clip, the ravenous and bloodthirsty **tumbleweed** rolls in front of the enemies, completely blinding and terrorizing the two. The second clip, however, demonstrates how a hero is nothing without his sidekick.

The following equation shows us the physics equation that Blizzard has implemented to make this little ball of hell a rolling nightmare. The enemy blindness is due to the angle at which the ball rolls, deflecting the yung sunrays at the enemies.

The fact that people expect this game to go competitive in its current state is top keks. Fix your game Blizzard. Literally unplayable.

Edit: I guess ill just put it here because somehow people found the original post made a year ago, the original post that was made a year ago was worked on by me, brian ( ProningWalrus ) and gage ( UnderEgag in the clip ) we posted it through his reddit account.

Thanks for participating, let's see what Sombra does next.

---
Hey guys, let me explain.

So we've been having one hell of a discussion on the Discord chat.  Myself and a few others have agreed that, perhaps the percentage stopping at 5% is because of us.

Back when we first realized the site was changing, there was very little traffic on the webpage.  It was jumping from 2% to 4% pretty fast.  This was when the revelation that the website was changing was fairly new.

But now, it's slowed to a complete halt at 5%.  

*We theorize that this may be because we're refreshing/trafficking the site.  It's almost fact now that the website is being changed manually.  Someone at Blizzard HQ is monitoring the website's traffic, seeing how high it is, and not adding to the percentage because of it.  So now what we're trying to do is to get as many people to ignore the website, and not refresh or even open the page at all, to see if the number spikes at all.*

So we're asking everyone here, personally and in hopes of getting this ARG out of the trench.

Please do **not** visit the website and refresh it.  Don't even open the website if you can help it.  Let the percentage grow.

We're aiming for at least a day of leave-alone time, and we're really hoping to reduce traffic in this 24 hour period.

This is what we're trying to get done, if we can get a heavy sum of Reddit and the Discord chat to follow along, something may happen.

Thank you guys.

EDIT:  Spread this around as much as you can, we're really trying!

Also:  **Sombra told us to wait.**  We should listen to her, she who has the information has the power.

EDIT2:  Cooperation is the best thing we can ask for, guys.  We don't know if this will help.  Remember; **This is an experiment, not an answer.** We're trying to see if this will improve anything.",Overwatch,1472193099.0,t3_4zn8ju

It's Finally Official: Playing Off-Meta Heroes In Ranked Is Against The Rules And Will Result In Penalties,"https://postimg.org/image/bh8of05oh/

I got reported for playing off-meta heroes many times. I got silenced many times based on these false reports. I got these silences overturned as I never abuse the chat. But now I got *this* reply instead. It's from a Game Master that actually consulted the issue with his supervisor so it's as good as an official announcement because it's how Blizzard treats these cases now, as opposed to how they treated them previously. Why the change? Beats me.

The relevant part is:

----

""One player stubbornly refusing to adapt can be a significant source of frustration (...), negatively impacting the experience of other players on the team and their enjoyment of the game.

In other words, actively refusing to switch character can and will have just as negative an impact on your team as if you were trolling and insulting them in the chat.

As such, and after discussing the case with my supervisor, I'm upholding the silence penalty.""

----

Well, it sure is nice to know that playing your favorite hero is not allowed as long as there's a single person who doesn't like it, and that Blizzard will let your account stay silenced to prevent you from doing that. Oh wait, it doesn't actually prevent it, I can still play the hero I want and I'm planning to. But with a silenced account, because it makes perfect sense.

Good job, Blizzard. Good job.

I'm sure with the ""updated"" report system, this silence will soon become a ban because who cares if you make your favorite hero work? If little meta-crazed Billy and his friends get upset by it, it's as good as trolling because the effect is the same, i.e. little Billy's upset! And the fault is not his of course, lil' Billy's the victim of the evil troll who dares play off-meta heroes in defiance of lil' Billy's commands! Unbelievable.",Overwatch,1479901324.0,t3_5egvcr
Unpopular(?) Opinion: Mercy isn't that OP; you just suck at targeting supports.,"In literally *any* other video game, when a boss suddenly spawns sub-bosses that heal it, the rule of thumb is to take out the supports before attacking the boss, right? So why does that not apply to Overwatch? 

I watched Mercy go through nerf to nerf to nerf, practically nerfed into the pavement including an entire rework. Everyone complaining about her just sound like they haven't been playing this game very long, probably only since OVW2 dropped. Yall would shit yourselves if you had to play against a 2016 ""5K Rezz"" Mercy. Ofc anyone getting pocketed by Mercy isn't going to go down easy-- you have to target Mercy first, if not the *other* support first that's helping her pocket so much. 

Can't get close enough to her? Learn a long-distance DPS (Widow, Ashe, hell even a Soldier can pick her off at a distance with enough accuracy.) Throw yourself into some AI games and learn how to fucking aim so you can pick her off more reliably, learn how to land those headshots more frequently, get more familiar with the maps so you can predict support positioning more accurately, learn to remember when the enemy has certain cooldowns to calculate the best time to flank the support in the backline-- literally do anything but just landing half-assed body shots on the Rein she's supporting and complaining ""WHY WON'T HE DIE???? MERCY OP!!!!!!!!"" 

Nowadays yall cannot even *fathom* that maybe, *maybe* your lack of understanding and familiarity with the game is to blame, and instead blame Mercy due to overexaggerated community bias and bandwagon-jumping. Sure, she could use a tweak here and there, but some of yall calling for an entire rework thinking it'll fix the whole game are delusional lol. I won't even touch the topic of some heroes being broken, because even if no heroes were broken, y'all would still complain about her because *you still suck at targeting support.*

You don't need *every* cosmetic,"I am seeing people in this sub bellyaching about the prices of the Overwatch 2 cosmetics. Have some of you never played another Free to Play video game? ( Fortnite, Apex Legends, Warzone, ect ). You are not supposed to buy every cosmetic. In fact, you are not even required to buy a single item in the item shop. 

At most, you should only buy the Battlepass and maybe the Starter pack. While the overwatch battlepass will not give you premium currency, the starter pack will actually give you 500 premium currency. Couple that with the 500 currency you will get from completing season challenges, and you will have enough currency to purchase the Season 2 battlepass for free. 

The era of Overwatch 1 lootboxes is over. We truly had it too good for many years. Now we are in the current era of live service games. We have 3 choices:

Don't give me the ""oh they dodged the question so that confirms payed heroes!!!!!!2111!11!!"" No it does not, the answers sounded pretty clear to me and I think everyone is reading way too much into it. 

This is Blizzard's first entry into the FPS market and they even said that now that the heroes are done, they can focus on showing us the other content that's going to be in the game. They seriously sound like they don't have any kind of set plan for what they are doing post release so lets stop jumping to ridiculous conclusions.

Perhaps I should preface since I didn't expect this to get any attention.  This is my opinion, that is something that should go without saying. You might really like this game if you were really into TF2, but as a classic shooter fan I enjoyed this game less than I expected.

Kiriko's suzu doesn't need a nerf.,"You heard me. Kiriko's suzu doesn't need a nerf. it's *you* (not you the reader) who needs to pay attention to her cool down of target her. As a Kiriko main myself I have had many times where I can't clense this or that. it's not as overpowered as you think.

as for the invincibility again, it really doesn't need to be nerfed any more. it takes 0.1 second to cast AND only gives 0.85 seconds of invincibility. not to mention you have to account for the time it takes the suzu to get to the ground. It takes alot of skill and timing to hit those suzus correctly. 

Now, I know it's annoying to have her cleanse a shatter or mei ult but nerfing cleanse is not the answer. The player base just needs to learn how to keep track when she uses the suzu and how far apart the members are and where Kiriko is.


Edit: Okay so, after going over the comments I can agree that maybe it could use a longer cool down, but still, my point still stands, it's really not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.",Overwatch,1673838747.0,t3_10d3gyb

"Can we make sure Overwatch doesn't become ""Safe Space Gaming""?","Hey folks,

I've been watching the forum over the last few weeks since open beta, starting with the ""can you not ""gg ez"" after wins?"" type threads, and trying to gauge what's been going on not only in my own games, but what folks have been posting up here.


A brief history for myself: I've been playing PvP for around 10 years now in various forms, be it TF2/COD:MW and sequels/Battlefield/Street Fighter IV/DOTA 2/LOL/CS:GO/H1Z1/Rocket League, and have grown up listening and being subjected to torrents of abuse in online matchmaking, from the standard ""git gud"", ""gg ez"", to being slandered for being Irish (""you little Irish c!nt"" the most recent one), to having all sorts shouted at me in various other languages, and have heard others get cut down in lobbies pretty nastily.  I have on more than one occasion met that ""12 year-old on XBox Live that said he's f*cked your mum"".

Online is never always the utopia we expect it to be.  Game creators have taken the necessary steps with report functions, game bans, mute options, and other measures, for us all to try and create a better atmosphere to play in, to develop our skills, and to enjoy our money's worth as a consumer and as people who may not be fortunate enough to be pro and play for a living.  You shouldn't have to come home from work or from wherever to flick on your game of choice and suddenly have every discernible insult possible rammed down your earpiece, it's not cool, it's not fun, and it's not needed.

That being said, especially with competitive play now upon us, I would give a gentle reminder to people that, as with sport in the world offline, tempers can flare, competition brings out the combative and sometimes nastier side in us all, and it IS to be expected with human nature.  If you've ever played in a team sport, especially as a kid, people becoming irate at each other, or blowing a gasket in the heat of the moment, is part of life.  You only have to look at the English Premier League, as a notable example, to see it happening.  Look at the gifs of Cristiano Ronaldo blowing a fuse as his often-outstanding run of scoring has diminished in the Euros.

This isn't me saying don't report people, by any means.  Just like online, IRL sports have consequences for continued dissent, racism (see Patrice Evra/Suarez case), prejudice (see Eva Carniero case), and taking things too far.

Be that as it may, I would implore with the community not only to watch your tone in game and recognise when you are in the wrong, but also ask that people don't get ban-happy with the reporting system, setting a precedent with Blizzard who may further lock down communication until it turns into over-arching molly-coddling like Nintendo, with only pre-assigned messages available, or the disturbing psychoanalysis-like reports toxic players are given in LoL, not to mention their clamping down on employees for in-game toxicity without an identifiable/definitive carry over on a broader sample size.

Remember, competitions have winners and losers, people can be nasty as well as nice, and whilst it's pleasant in hindsight to ask people to re-word their intended statements in-game, it would be wholly unexpected, in the middle of a clutch firefight, or when one mistake can swing a match, for people to do so.

Please watch your tone online, but please do not turn this game into something where our communication is dictated for us.

EDIT:

To try and address a few points mentioned below without resorting to individual replies in there interests of time:

a)  I understand people think this is a long-winded post, however any nuance/depth to the discussion cannot be easily summarised and it was to avoid any misunderstandings arising or things being taken only at face value. Also, for the curious, we now read differently:[link on F-Shaped Pattern for reading](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/)

b)  Whilst there is no punishment for repeatedly reporting people, I would make people aware that there may come a point where Blizzard staff may be tired of having to resolve circumstances of reporting and abuse of the system, and simply get rid of open channels of communication such as text chat and voice chat.  Anyone who has played Mario Kart 8 will know what the future may look like.

c )  Sportsmen may indeed, at the end of the match, leave things on the pitch, and let bygones be bygones.  In rugby, for example, they may form a tunnel for the opposing team to walk through and applaud them for a good match, and apologise, and that's cool, I've seen many teams shake hands after nearly destroying each other.  But, during that match, not only will name-calling arise, but fists will fly, kicks may be thrown, chokes placed, and too many men have been brutalised from whole teams going to war with each other, such is the nature of the sport. The British Lions on tour havw seen some atrocities, as a prime example.  This however, is expected. It is not taken as an inevitability, but a strong likelihood as 30 men come together in dangerous physical contact.  You are dealing with humans that, when pushed to a certain limit, will break.  This is no different from in game.  We as humans have limits, and just as we have limits to how much we will take before reporting someone, we will also have limits to how much pent-up frustration we hold back.  Both sides should be aware of this before going in to a game.

d)  ""Don't be a dick"" is indeed a valid rule, but doesn't take into account a host of other factors.  Humans aren't simply wrapped up and explained in buzzwords and quotes, we're a lot more complex than that.

e)  Language is subjective, what offends one may not offend another. Everyone from every background should remember this, and furthermore should realise the best thing you can do as a person is to challenge what you believe is unacceptable through structured discussion and debate with others, not by shouting at them or simply muting, which only exacerbates the issue or patches over it.  C!nt in the US is highly offensive.  In Australia it's an endearing suffix.  ",Overwatch,1467370098.0,t3_4qr4d0
I don't think the ten dollar battle pass is outrageous,"I don't mind paying ten bucks for a new hero or a bunch of rewards.

What I don't get is how a new hero, and a bunch of small rewards is $10, and a single skin can be double that price. As a value proposition, I can't wrap my head around that.

Ok. It's time that I finally state what's been on a lot of people's mind. Please don't post that obviously fanserviced mercy fanart here. I'm sure we have some NSFW sub for you to post that stuff, however, let's not forget that r/Overwatch is a SFW sub. Most of us are browsing this sub at work or school. I really don't want to see all the great artists out there start focusing on this kind of fanart. **Don't get me wrong, I like that art too, I just don't see it's place here.** I love the Overwatch subreddit and community and I don't want to see us heading toward these kind of things.

Edit:xArDDe put it best
> I don't mind it but it makes the image of the community worse. If this gets out of hand, it will turn into r/Anime and r/Undertale.

Another great quote:
>Wow, these commentors really didn't read the OP. It's not about his viewing the posts, its about community culture. As NSFW material is upvoted, those who find it distasteful leave, and the subreddit becomes that much less diverse. Not to mention the game is rated PEGI 12, so the game's community has plenty of kids. We could certainly stand to be a bit more kid-friendly.

churrmander summarizes:
>I agree, and I'll admit, I like the NSFW stuff, too. However, a wise man once said, ""There's a time and a place for everything,"" and that place is the NSFW sub for Overwatch.

You all have a warped perspective of how much the average player cares about heroes being locked. The vast majority don't care.,"It's literally standard procedure for these types of games to lock heroes behind something, whether that be time, money, in-game currency, or a combination thereof. Blizzard's own MoBA (yes, it still exists 😢) does this, as does LoL. 

The silent majority of players don't care about locked heroes because they typically only play 1-2 heroes anyway. Using myself as an example, I have 5 days of playtime on DvA, and my next highest played hero is Ashe at like 30 hours. It's not even close. 

Now, this kind of one tricking was discouraged by Overwatch's design of hard counters and ability to switch during rounds, but according to the devs, they're shying away from the hard counter design for OW2 - likely *because* they know most people play 1-2 heroes and don't engage with optimal switches during rounds anyway (confirm this for yourself by...literally just playing the game).

Will I want to dabble with the new heroes? Sure. But I'm also not too pressed about them. As with HotS and these other games with similar systems, I'll play them if I want to. And holy shit, am I looking forward to less smurfs.

TL;Dr all your protestations mean nothing to the average player. You're denying yourself from what will likely be a very fun game over a system patterned off of stuff that's been around for like a decade.

Dataminers found information about the upcoming hero and it's release date in the recent patch!,,Overwatch,1488205134.0,t3_5wgy9j
A comment about the state of the community,"Let me just start off by saying I’ve been a fan of this game since beta and have an ungodly amount of hours logged. I have stood on the mountain tops and have furiously shook my fist at the blizzard gods just like everyone else. I also have personal opinions about certain business practices.

Having said that.. let’s take a look at the history of the game.

Originally the game launched 6 years ago and was 40 dollars a non-premium for what I consider a AAA quality game(considering how well it plays).
It has 

-dedicated server support (not p2p) / free
-quarterly consistent patches / free
-character releases / free
-map releases / free
-seasonal content and events / free 

Not only were they patching the game but the game is almost unrecognizable from when it first launched.

Now they are releasing overwatch 2 (finally). Something that’s way overdue and everyone has been waiting to play considering how stagnant the game became for us all. With it comes free content to the original owners of the game and basically an entire remaster of the core game and its characters and general gameplay direction with change of team size. Yes, the PvE content is pay walled but is.. lets be honest kind of like a flavor project and has nothing to do with why anyone does or has ever played this game so it’s an optional purchase.

So here we are OW2 around the corner. They are releasing a battle pass instead of charging anyone for the next few years of continued service in all of the above listed areas which is quite expensive mind you let’s be honest. In this battle pass you get the content you actually want without paying ( the character ). And you can continue to play ow2 and all its service and releases for what it seems just for years to come without them asking you for anymore money.

After all this waiting, fanboying, thousands of hours, memories with friends being silly in quick play or crazy sweatlord level plays and wins in competitive. They are releasing the game in full, and designed a non-mandatory way to create funding for development. And lets be honest you’re going to play it. 
The biggest thing everyone is doing is grabbing pitchforks with flavor of the month witch burning and doomer statements like youre all being tortured and robbed of your innocence by a battle pass after 6 years of the game not getting with the times to make revenue for real content development. 

Tl;dr.- MAYBE the best thing to do just before a rush back to the game is not create hate, animosity, doomer outlook, and toxicity between eachother and the game. The only people stopping you from enjoying OW has been and always will be YOU. Maybe it hasn’t been that bad this whole time.",Overwatch,1663331595.0,t3_xfq33m
Can we please stop saying stats don’t matter?,"In OW1, this was absolutely true. We had a metal system that didn’t give all the information, and was really terrible. However, having the amount of stats we have in OW2 is a great thing. Of course, it’s not the whole story, but the stats DO matter. Healing, mitigation, and damage numbers are all important, and I love that I can see our teams stats AND the enemy teams stats. Other important stats are deaths, weapon accuracy, hero specific stats. I’m just tired of hearing people say the stats don’t matter, as if THEY know the game but YOU don’t. If the enemy team is out healing you by 6k…it’s a problem. If the enemy tank is mitigating 2K less, but doing 4K more damage, you’re fine. If the dps has 1k more damage, but 6 more deaths, that’s a problem. Just saying…

Edit: So that I can cover multiple responses at once, I’m not saying stats are all that matters. I am saying that’s stats are an objective way to tell your efficacy in the game when things are going wrong. Saying “stats don’t matter” is giving the wrong impression to the player base as a whole. If you’re saying, “stats matter, but…” or “the only stat that matters is…” I have no problem with that. You are still using the statistics. My problem, is that we’ve given a huge excuse to people who can’t self-reflect. As of right now. Stats are the only objective way a player can do that.",Overwatch,1673549302.0,t3_10a78o3

Blizzard way of doing beta = bad.,"I really cant comprehend how blizzard thinks its a good idea to enable 5% of the community to play the game and having 95% beeing frustrated and annoyed? The hype that you create with the initial streams and whatnot doesnt last long, immediatly after that comes annoyance, frustration and even anger sometimes. Now please some ELI5, how is it a good plan to annoy and frustrate 95% of the community? I think blizzards way of doing beta is mindblowingly bad. We saw that with HOTS, many people (my self included) were hyped for HOTS, but after waiting for so long when i eventually did get my access i didnt care for it anymore, im pretty sure this will happen with overwatch to a alot of people. Sorry for the rant but this is the last thing i wanted to say before i hop off the hype train =/

Everyone in the pug attacked me, telling me how bad I was at the game, before I could even have the chance to really learn the character. I don't play overwatch to be ridiculed for not knowing how to play my character, let alone completely grasp the game yet.

Am I the only one who actually likes OW2?,"I get that people are upset about losing OW1, but this game really isn't that bad. All games in the last decade or so have had problems at launch. In order to compete in today's live service game industry there has to be some form of monetization scheme that allows the devs to keep working on it.

On top of that, the 5v5, to me, feels a lot better. No more blaming tanks for being bad. More accountability for dps and support. It feels way better than just having teams that sit behind shields and spam damage into the enemy team. And the new game mode, characters, and maps are great.",Overwatch,1665009805.0,t3_xworh0
The new OW2 role passives are all on the wrong classes.,"I’ve seen a lot of people complaining about the new role passives since the beta dropped, and I can’t help but agree. The current situation gives Tanks reduced knockback, Damage a speed boost, and Support a health regen. I think all of these passives could help improve the game, but the way I see it they are all on the wrong roles. 

Tanks get reduced knockback, but it doesn’t seem that substantial to them, several have a quick way to recover, and Rein already has that passive. Supports get health regen, but most supports already have a form of self heal, it does nothing for the burst damage that normally kills supports, and mercy already has that passive. And by far the biggest complaint I’ve seen is the new speed boost to damage. Several damage already have substantial mobility, and the new buff just enables them to be particularly oppressive. 

I think the role passives are a good new feature, but I think they should have been done as:
-   Support get speed boost, giving them a better chance to avoid that burst damage and to reach teammates quicker.
-   Tanks get health regen, giving them more sustainability to act as a “tank” without necessarily a need for a pocket support.
-    Damage get reduced knockback, giving them more control over their plays and reducing the CC that dps have been having issue with.",Overwatch,1651346690.0,t3_ufi42x
Supports Deserve Compensation,"We are done with this. I do not care how crazy this sounds. I do not care who disagrees with me. Support mains deserve compensation for the mess Blizzard has created. This last patch has been awful. The McCree aim bug, Mei freeze, and the on fire calculator for supports. Are you serious, Blizzard? Are you actually serious? Support is already the most frustrating class to play, but now you are discouraging people from playing it because you think the only way to be good at the game is to get kills and use ultimate? I would still be in master right now if it were not for this stupid on fire change. Every win would be a maximum of twenty SR. I could get 25k heals with 50 assists, look at my on fire meter, and still fail to attain that. Want to know why? Healers are now DISCOURAGED from doing what they are supposed to. If you are not ulting every team fight, well, tough luck 'cause you suck. You want people rezzing for no reason and nano boosting for overkill? 

The frustration has only increased. We already play the most unrewarding class in the game. Now you actually take away any reward. A 50% winrate should stall you not drop you 130 SR after 4 losses! I play support because that is what I am in any game, sport, or anything. I played Centerfield in baseball; I sat in the back and covered for my star players' mistakes. I played left back for soccer; I made up for what my midfielders' and keeper's mistakes. I played medic in BF4, and I heal in Overwatch because it is what I enjoy doing. Everything about this system is negating that enjoyment.

I do not understand why more people are not as mad about this as I am. Actually, I am lying. I do know why, If this were flipped- If the on fire meter did not care for a DPS's damage, kills, and final blows, there would be a rampage. There would be people screaming at Jeff Kaplan right now, and there would be changes in a day. 

Go ahead and try playing healer. Log on to your game, and instalock mercy right now. Watch in horror as your fire meter never passes fifteen percent full until you rez. Then, when you lose (you will because your frustration will be to the max), watch your SR drop 20-50 points. After that, ask your DPS counterpart how much he or she lost? I absolutely guarantee you that he or she will lose less 9/10 times. 

This is the most unacceptable thing to happen. We deserve compensation. My idea is that every player who has played 80% of their time should have all of their games where they have lost reverted. This means all support SRs would increase to where they should be. I would propose a compromise, but it is more than just losing SR from just losses. We lose SR from wins too. We are missing 20SR per every win. It is only fair to us if we have all our losses reverted so we regain our SR.

Criticize me. Call me a crybaby. It isn't fair, and you know it.

Blizzard deleted my 183 upvotes,"TL;DR: Blizzard deleted my upvotes and changed the up/downvotes in the replies, in a thread about Hanzo's ""Okami"" skin.

EDIT: Somebody on the blizzard forum told me about ""votebots"". If this is what happened to the thread (let's say a Hanzo user or any angry forum user wanted to bury the case), all my excuses to Blizzard.

EDIT 2: Okay guys, let's assume what I said in EDIT 1 is what happened, Blizzard is innocent and that's it. I don't want them to be wrongly accused because of me. /thread

So on June 21st I created a thread on the Blizzard Forum to talk about Hanzo's ""Wolves"" skins that make his Ult harder to hear in some situations.

http://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20745434425#1

Some of you may have seen it since it got quite popular (183 upvotes, which is very high and shows that many players experience this issue.)

But as other ""less upvoted"" topics got blue messages from the Blizzard staff, mine was ignored by them. But I just kept believing.

And right now, as I open the thread to see how it goes, I see that Blizzard simply DELETED THE UPVOTES of my thread.


Fortunately, I was smart enough to see this kind of sucker punch coming and I had made screenshots of my thread beforehand:

And here is my thread currently:

http://imgur.com/MJwWsMx



To add insult to injury, not only did they delete my upvotes, but they also modified all the up/downvotes of the early replies. (I cannot prove that one because I did not take screenshots of the replies, but it is becomes obvious if you consider all the upvotes I got plus the size of the thread).
They even upvoted a previously mass-downvoted reply that tells that I'm wrong and the problem does not exist.


So why would Blizzard change the up/downvotes on such a thread? The only goal I see here is to make me less credible and hide the issue about this Hanzo skin.

And here I am. i come to you on Reddit because if I make such a thread on the Blizzard forum, they would immediately delete it. Whereas Blizzard has no power in here.

I cannot let Blizzard get away with this. This is way too big. What would you do if you were me?

To be honest I don't care about the Hanzo skin imbalance now. I just think that modifying the up/downvotes to make a thread less credible is pure manipulation, and unethical. This is why I expose this ""case"" here.",Overwatch,1467834366.0,t3_4rkdeh

To all of those arguing that there needs to be a unique hero restriction,"EDIT:**""...Overall, Overwatch is a game about switching heroes. We feel like the dynamic gameplay and the core systems of the game are all tuned around this fact of team play, and counter play. Switching heroes is a part of this game. We see your threads when you say on the internet ""I think you should lock into heroes"" and our answer to that is, *That is not what Overwatch is about*"" -Jeff Kaplan <Game Director & Vice President, Overwatch**

   A CORE fundamental part of the game is the counter system. It is the key mechanic. Without it, there is no Overwatch, only some repeat of the games you have already seen before. If you believe that character stacks are a problem, you have no idea what Overwatch is and you do not understand how to play the game the way it is meant to be played, so allow me to inform you.


   You start off playing as Attack. You think, well we need an assault so I'll pick Soldier 76. The game starts and you see a Winston coming across the screen. The first time you die, you had BETTER switch to Reaper if somebody else hasn't already, or you are a burden to the team. If you see a Bastion, you IMMEDIATELY get a Tracer. All of the people crying that Bastion kills them all the time, are playing Overwatch like its a MOBA or a TDM shooter.


   Your goal is NOT to kill the Bastion. Your goal is NOT to sit at the back and snipe people. You're NOT trying to get kills. You have to get YOUR TEAM's payload, to THEIR base. However you accomplish that is a means to an end that you get to work out with your team. 


   I'll tell you this, you take ANY 6 stack of characters against a team of devs, it doesn't matter how incredibly amazing you are with those characters, you're going to get stomped. The other team picks 6 Winstons? You pick 6 Reapers. Done, you win. They pick 6 Bastions? You pick a Symmetra, Pharah, Tracer, Reaper combination. I notice when I play that people tend to stick with who they want to play and that is the WRONG way to play the game. When you see people picking 6 stacks, punish them for it, it won't happen in the higher tiers of play because its suicide.


   You should find yourself changing characters 3 - 5 times per game, along with the other team. You have the entire arsenal of characters to play with!! With a unique character limit, you have a Winston that is wrecking everybody and your reaper is failing to take care of him, you now have to say, ""Hey uh.. can you get better at reaper and deal with this Winston?"" instead of just hopping on Reaper and shutting down the Winston yourself. That's a core dynamic of the game just eliminated.


   That's another thing. People still are trying to kill whatever is in front of them. STOP doing that! You're not going to kill that bastion with your Soldier 76, leave it and move on to a class that you counter. Pick your battles. This is why Tracer is so strong because she can choose to engage with the things that she counters.


   Are you a Pharah? Your only job is to kill turrets and support. You can screw around after but if there is a turret or support around, you ignore everything but them. Does your enemy have a Tracer or a Reaper? Don't pick a Bastion. If they switch off of Tracer and Reaper, go Bastion, FORCE them to deal with your team comp, THAT is how the game is supposed to be played. The first thing you should do when you see the enemy characters is go, ""Okay, our reaper will shut down their Winston, our Pharah's got the Torb, our Symmetra's got their Torb and Reinhardt, our tracer has their bastion, we're good"". And if every player is good, they will know exactly which character they are meant to engage and when the enemy team switches because they're being wrecked, you switch to compensate.


   In conclusion, if you think that Blizzard is going to limit characters to unique ones, even for ""ranked"" play, you are sadly mistaken and you'd better just suck it up and learn to play the game correctly. They'd be eliminating one of the best mechanics that Overwatch has that keeps the game incredibly dynamic and organic the entire way through. I don't think most of you have wrapped your head around how often you need to be switching characters and how fundamental to the game it is, and the ones who haven't are that way cause you're stuck at the bottom of the MMR list running around with Widowmaker trying to rack up all ""tha killz"".


   I'm sorry for the frustration but I'm so sick of hearing people shit on one of the best parts about this game because they keep trying to label it or compare it to things they already know and its not like that. There are similarities, sure, but this is Overwatch. Get the fuck out of here with your boring ass MOBA/classic shooter shit.

===TLDR=== Having no restrictions only leads to more freedom and more options. Adding the restrictions benefits noone, doesn't solve any perceived problems, and only presents the possibility for toxicity and player frustration. The ""Real"" meta game is about knowing the counters, so even in ranked play - that is a mechanic. **Overwatch will NEVER have a unique character requirement because then the game would not be Overwatch.**",Overwatch,1446697896.0,t3_3rl88b

Why I requested a refund today. [not a rage post],"Today I requested a full refund for the pre-order Origin Edition. I will most likely purchase the $40 game at a later point in time, but not the $60. Why should I pay upfront $60 when it serves me 0 benefit or early bonus? The game doesn't come out for half a year! Initially my hopes was that I would be treated as a priority for getting into the game and the community. When I pre-ordered StarCraft2 I was given a beta code and a friend invite! Now that some of the hype in my mind has died down, I am beginning to realize that I will ultimately want to try the game before I buy it and I probably won't care about the extra special skins and I probably will have a lot of time to decide about that anyways. That is why I have requested a full refund. I don't feel duped, or lied too. I understand the beta is random. I just don't see any reason to give out my money this early (6 months) and feel like there is 0 incentive for me to not want to get a refund.

TL:DR; I paid $60 way to early for a promise of a game and nothing else. Why shouldn't I hold my money and wait until something else is on the table?

Edit: Pre-ordering used to be a $5 down payment at gamestop for a reserve on the box copy of the game!

"Good morning, Bliz. Your community has some concerns regarding the latest cosmetic items.","You may have been expecting this when you went to bed last night, or perhaps since before then.

But large portions of the community, myself included, are, pretty unanimously, unhappy about the way you're handling these ""Summer Games"" themed items and lootboxes.

Basically, large portions of the community, myself included feel exploited and lied to. I realize you probably never said the exact words ""We're not going to release limited-time items that you can't buy with in-game currency"". I realize that technically, you can get away with calling this free. 

But it certainly goes against the spirit of what we've been told. You must have known large portions of the community wouldn't be happy about this. Or else you'd have told us about it, instead of us finding out from some middle-of-the-night European PS4 store leak. You've been proudly trumpeting about a bunch of awesome, free content for the summer. To discover that your definition of ""free"" is so under-handed is only going to create distrust within the community. 

What will you backpedal on next, one has to ask? What hoops will we have to jump through to unlock the next hero or map so that you can technically call it ""free"" while blatantly trying to exploit us into buying something on top of our $40-60 game?

I don't want to be this upset with you. I don't think any of us do. Especially when compared to certain other developers I could mention as of late, you guys have been responsive and caring towards the community. I've been extolling you guys as an example of what other studios should aspire towards in terms of openness and communication. But trust is tossed away much more easily than it is built.

What do we want done about this? There's no consensus, but the safest way would be to simply make this all a standard extension of the items we already have. In other words, there ought to be no time limit, and in-game coins ought to be able to buy these new items normally, perhaps at a slight increase in price.

At the very least, large portions of the community, myself included, would like to see one of those steps taken as a half-measure. Or as an absolute last-resort, allow us to buy certain summer games-themed items instead of having to buy boxes and pray. I'd personally still find this to be a bit of a scummy practice for the reasons I've outlined above, and I don't think I'm alone in that, but at the very least this would allow us to get the items we want out of this deal.

There's a lot of anger going on about this. I'm trying to be more polite here, but I also don't want to mince words - Large portions of the community, myself included are deeply disappointed in you right now, Blizzard. But it's not too late to fix this. You guys have been super-cool so far, and I think I can speak for large portions of the community when I say we can forgive this if you're willing to cooperate and change.

I got my first ever promotion since I started playing and I cried.,"This is my first time posting, so please forgive any mistakes. I've been playing Overwatch since fall of last year, I started on console and quickly moved to PC to play with my friends. I've been shifting between 2300 and 2400 consistently and only yesterday I reached 2515. 

When I started playing Overwatch it was my first ever multiplayer and one of my first shooters. I had a very lonely playstyle. I come from a different country where videogames aren't available to most children and my mechanical skill is definitely not on par with the best of players. I am a girl, and I've been harassed online before, so I was scared of joining voice chat. People on this subreddit reassured me Overwatch-- while not perfect-- was better than most multiplayer games out there when it came to toxicity. They were right. I can count in one hand the number of times someone's been truly hideous to me, and my teammates usually come to my defense or reassure me I shouldn't listen to that person.

I love Overwatch competitive, whenever I play QuickPlay for too long I miss it. I love teamwork, I love when a group of strangers or a couple of friends get together and really push themselves for the win. 

On the game that promoted me to Platinum, a Genji player mocked me for what he perceived to be my poor playstyle as I was the only Gold in a team of Plats. The other half of my duo told me not to listen to them, but I felt sad that this game would be the one that took me into Plat, a game that was less than the ideal I had learned to expect from Comp. But instead of fading quietly into the background I continued making callouts and informing my teammates of my needs and how I could assist their's. I pushed through for the team, and when we won I cried because I was so happy. That lone Genji didn't matter anymore. After a couple months of Comp I was exactly where I wanted to be. 

I am perfectly happy to be an average player, so long as I continue playing with people who want to have fun truly working together and win in the process. I think it's really easy to put yourself down when watching Overwatch League or much better players' streams, but it helps to remember we all have access to the same community and it can be wonderful at absolutely any skill level. Thanks, guys. You're the best. 

Because you listened to my silly little story here's a drawing of my main and my other half's enjoying the end of the season.

The Overwhelming Negativity Surrounding the ARG Scares me for this Game's Future,"Okay, look, I'm not gonna be an apologist for this ARG. It was poorly themed and managed, and I think people had the wrong idea of what it was going to divulge(that being lore, rather than gameplay). Overall, it wasn't the most positive experience for the community. This would be a fine, learning experience, if it weren't for the community's extreme negativity.

From the almost unending slew of posts talking shit at Blizz's handling, to people leaving the community and game altogether, to discussions on plans to fucking boo Blizz at Blizzcon, the reaction to the ARG scares me somewhat. Blizz obviously tried something different here, and from this reaction, it could be interpreted that that isn't what we want. No, I'm not advocating for what we got here per say, what I'm saying is that this backlash could discourage cool promotions like this for future heroes. This Sombra ARG may be the last thing we see of this nature because of the backlash, and wouldn't that be a pitiful little tumor sticking off OW's record as more heroes are dropped right from buttfuck nowhere like Ana was.

I get discorded and my health gets shredded like I'm a squishy if I so much as peak the enemy team. As a DPS and Support main, he honestly feels like the Tank version of Widowmaker - You're pretty much boned unless your team commits to full dive or you also have a Zen.

I used to be agitated at posts saying Zen needed to be reworked or nerfed, because of how easy he is to dive and kill. After my experience honestly, I totally get what Tank players are saying. He's not as easy as people claim he is too dive -  If I dive solo, as long as he so much as a little bit of peel I'm forced to dive out because my HP drops like a fly. He does a shit ton of damage and his kick is surprisingly useful. The only true success I've had against his is when I convinced my team to go full dive.

I get this subreddit heavily favors supports, but I suggest you try playing Tank in competitive against Zen - It is the worst experience and least fun I've ever had, even worse than season 1 support with the DPS passive. The amount of value he gets for pressing one button is ridiculous, and he completely ruins everything that makes tank fun. Any game against a Zen I spend most of it not being able to create space, instead hiding behind walls like many on this subreddit claim is the answer to discord - ""Just don't LOS for 3 seconds!""

Let's get this OW2 info straight.,"I am sick and tired of seeing all this misinformation spewing about, and I'm not mad at the people, this should have been done by the OW team but their communication skills seems to be crap.

*Edit: This information is for people who already own OW1.  People coming to OW for the first time after OW2 is released has a much different experience which I am not addressing here!  I'm also focusing on the information that people usually gotten wrong.  Stuff like people being locked out because of their choice of cellphone provider is an issue that's pretty clear.*

*Edit: So apparently I've come off as more positive then I intended.  So I'll add my own concerns and doubts as some commentary as italicized text.*

*Update: We got a look at the shop and battle pass.  Doesn't look great.*

**What are we getting with OW2?**

Over the next 2 years and at the release of OW2 we will be getting 9 new heroes and 9 new maps.  These have a delayed release because its a lot healthier for the game to try and balance new heroes one at a time then trying to sort out a mess of them.  *The OW team is simultaneously brilliant and terrible at balancing the game, so they need time and player feedback for each one.*

**What do you mean heroes are locked?**

Yes, they are ""locked"" inside the battle pass.  But they're not really ""locked"" completely.  When a hero is locked you can't play them in quick play, unranked, and competitive modes.  Any locked hero is still available to you in arcade or practice modes.  Meaning if you only play mystery heroes, you'll have access to every hero without ever unlocking them.  You can also pull them out in practice to see if its a hero you want to spend coins/cash on in the first place.  *Take them for a test drive before you purchase! That's nice.*

New heroes come out every even season (2,4,6,8...).  Every odd season (3,5,7,9...) we will be getting a new map that does not have to be unlocked.  Season 1 doesn't follow this since its the launch of the game and we're getting 3 new heroes and 3 new maps.

**How do I unlock new heroes?**

There are several ways to unlock them.

1. Pay $10 to instantly be able to play them, but you'll still have to wait two weeks to play them in comp.  This is to make sure they don't pull a Brig again.
2. Play the game until they're unlocked for you in the free battle pass.
3. You can earn up to 540 coins per season and buying a battle pass is 1,000 coins, so if you save up enough coins just by playing the game, you can unlock heroes instantly every other season.  And Heroes come out every other season so it lines up perfectly!
4. You can unlock old heroes by doing challenges
5. You can unlock old heroes by buying them in the shop with coins.

*The potential for all this to be predatory bullshit is high.  If the free path to unlock heroes requires more time than a full time job, then its predatory.  If streams haven't finished the BP in like the first two weeks, there's a huge problem and its just corporate greed veiled as options.  They haven't released how much exp is needed and how much you gain from doing things so that's a big worry.*

**Can I play Competitive with heroes still locked?**

Yes you can!  Having heroes locked does not stop you from playing competitive.

The Devs came out and explained their reasoning.  People only play a small number of heroes in competitive play.  And the higher rank you go, the smaller that pool is.  So it doesn't change the game play at all if you have a hero locked that you wouldn't play anyways.  They showed the data that on average people play around 5-6 heroes in competitive and the higher ranks have the smallest pools.  They have the data that people just don't switch.

*And this makes sense, with a growing roster trying be good at all the heroes is just stupid.  Not even OWL players are that good on the fly.  OW coaches have always said to play what you're best at and not what's meta for the 90% of the player base.  So having a hero that you're not good at locked in comp doesn't really change anything.  Hell, DPS arn't getting a new hero for like 6-8 months?  Why would they be locked out of comp because of a locked hero in a different role?  Are DPS just suppose to wait around with LONGER queue times while the tanks and support finally unlock everything? It makes zero sense.  So if they do that, scream at them.*

**Where is the promised PvE?**

Its coming in 2023 at some point.

*They're taking their time with it which makes me happy! At least I hope they are.*

**How much does OW2 cost?**

At the low end, nothing, $0.00, you can unlock everything playable just by playing the game.  You'll earn enough coins to even instantly unlock heroes when their battle passes come up.

At the high end, $60 a year.  $10 every 2 months.  This will unlock all heroes instantly and open up new cosmetics that free passes can't access.

The cost to unlock all playable content without waiting would be $10 every other season, so every 4 months.  This works out to $2.50 a month or $30 a year.  Minus any battle passes you can unlock with coins just by playing the game.

If you compare this to a box release instead of a live service, that $60 over the next 2 years will get you 9 new heroes, 9 new maps, a ton of cosmetics, and everything else that they could release instantly.  Events are still a thing too; a new and improved Junkenstein is happening later in October.

*Again, this is fair assuming the free path is decent. It could be predatory FOMO corporate BS, but we'll have to see.*

**Won't free to play mean there's a ton of smurfs?**

No, you need a non pre paid cell number in order to play OW2.  And then in order to get into comp you have to WIN 50 games in quick play, after you actually unlock quick play as an option as new to OW players will unlock things slowly.

In order to smurf, you'll need to buy a whole new cell phone plan, go through all the tutorial stuff, some how win 50 games in quick play without letting the system know how you good you are, and then if you do all that, then you'll be able to smurf in low ranks in competitive.

*I understand that no barrier is inpenetrable, so there still will be dedicated smurfs, but this should make it a lot harder which makes me happy.  What doesn't make me happy;*

This however is causing a problem with people who just have a prepaid cell.  Legit players are being locked out of the game.

*Which sucks, big time. I'm assuming that they'll have a work around for this because I doubt the suits will turn away paying customers.*

**Do I need to buy the Gabralter Pack?**

No, that just gives you the season 1 pack, 2,000 coins which you can buy 2 more season packs, and some skins.  You do not need to buy this to play the game.

*Stop preordering shit.  Do not buy this, let them show you that they made a decent product worth your time and money before you open your wallet.*

**Is this good for the game?**

*In this day and age of this capitalist hellscape, yes.*  Battle passes are just the norm for online games, they're easy to understand for non OW players and don't exploit people with gambling problems.

*For people who pay money, it help fund development of even more content.  For people who grind, it keeps the player base high.*

*I hate to say it could have been worse, but it could have been a lot worse.  This is the same company that just made all the money with Diablo Immortal and the worse thing about it is heroes are in the BP? Like shit man, OW got hit with nuke and only got a sprained ankle.  Its not ideal, but I'll take it.*

Its been called one of the best battle passes on the market.  Not my words.

*And looks like the free battle pass is pretty bad and looks like you can't get any skins unless you pay money or earn coins for the shop.*

The cost to completely unlock the battle pass can cost hundreds of dollars.

*There is where the whaling has kicked in.  People probably won't drop that at the start of the season, less their streamers or something, but the predatory aspects kick in near the end because of a sunk cost fallacy* *wanting to get your BP's worth even if it costs you an extra$100.*

Edit:

**Are you Blizzard fan boy?**

*Absolutely not.  This whole battle pass is on thin fucking ice.  If a person with a life outside of video games can't reasonably unlock the hero through the season, then this whole thing comes crashing down.  Suddenly its demanding you pay for that battle pass or else you're shit out of luck.  If a player with a full time job/family is constantly left further and further behind when it comes to hero unlocks as time goes on, then this BP just a wolf in sheep's clothing and I'll be glad to help hand out the torches and pitch forks.*

*Message to the devs from Barret: Don't fuck up.*

I hope that clears up some misconceptions!  And if I got something wrong, let me know, and I'll make edits!

Was Illari Overnerfed?,"No one seems to be talking about her now after the most recent primary hitbox and Pylon nerfs. Many players and content creators (mostly the ones that play DPS and Tanks) were very loud about her being too strong before the latest nerfs (primary hitbox reduced by half and Pylon health reduced to 100 and cooldown increased to 15s). Since her release, she got nothing else but nerfs across her kit, from Ult and primary to Pylon and secondary healing. Do you think that overall Illari was overnerfed or she is fine how she is now?",Overwatch,1700160747.0,t3_17wudug

Unpopular opinion: The Roadhog nerf wasn't that bad.,"I mean he got a clip increase, fire rate increase, and a smaller headshot hitbox and all the Hog would have to do is to get some follow up from your team, which even the worst teams I've seen atleast know to shoot whoever the hog hooks.

I feel however the buff on the PTR right now is very fair and lets hog actually assume the role of tank.

Tell me I'm wrong though.

Edit: Im not great of a hog player but I can shred tanks and squishies a like just by spamming fire. Get good, the nerf just made it so he needs to play with his team.

The Torbjorn buff on the PTR is bad because it promotes a bad playstyle,Torbjorn is my second most played with 30 hours and I felt like he was kind of balanced. That is because I actually used his gun a lot more than other Torbjorn players do. His gun has really high dps if you have good aim with it and know when to use m1 or m2. But what they basicly did to Torbjorn is buff his attack speed with the hammer so he can reapair his turret faster. Already lots of people were making him feel underpowered because they just sit at the turret smashing it not using him to his full potentional. Now that kind of playstyle is promoted with that attack speed buff. They also decreased the reward for being a better player by giving him less scrap from bodies. You can sit in one room smashing your turret whole game and if u take dmg sometimes just drop down some armor you don t even have to go out. Make his armor work like an ult or just change him in some way so he has to actually move around to be effective.,Overwatch,1477067831.0,t3_58o6k5
Ana is not a high skill hero,The biggest myth of overwatch 2 is that ana is a super high skill hero. In overwatch 1 yes id agree she was a high skill hero because it was significantly harder to land her abilities between 2 tanks and there defensive utilities especially against coordinated dive tanks. However in overwatch 2 with only 1 tank it is not difficult at all to constantly anti-nade or sleep the solo tank which is arguably the best use of her kit. I'm so sick of people defending this character cause she is high skill. Her anti nade provides ridiculous value for being stupid easy to land. Sleep dart is the strongest CC in the game and 95% of the time it's just spammed on tank. I don't know why everyone complains about cass nade when anas sleep dart literally makes it so you can't play the game at all and are completely at the mercy of your team and the enemy team. Also sleep dart takes 0 skill to land on a tank. Ana is about 75% of the reason  that the tank role is so miserable to play and I'm sick of watching the tank role and it's pool of players get smaller/worse by the day because nobodies willing to touch their precious ana who has 2 of the strongest abilities in the game in a single character and who has had the highest pick rate and has been dominant in the meta for literally years because those abilities are so strong.,Overwatch,1696706552.0,t3_172ejbw

This subreddit needs to calm down,"Ok, i just had to create an account after reading through some of the posts in here. I come from the r/LoL subreddit and it's awesome to gather new information about the game, but if you are familiar with the subreddit there's also lots of circlejerking going on. I always felt sympathetic for the game developers, i cant't imagine how hard it must be to go through all the hatefull comments and get to the ones that are actual constructive criticism.
But compared to what's going on here right now, circlejerk over at r/LoL looks like a joke.
Did everybody just abandon the concept of logic? I read phrases like 'voicing our opinions matter' but is it really YOUR opinion you are voicing? Did you actually gather all the information that's available right know and think through it or did you just conveniently follow the circlejerk?
Some of the more popular 'opinions':

**If i preorder the game it is my right to get a beta invite.**
Did you ever preorder movie tickets before the movie came out and complained that some people at selected test screenings could watch it before you? Or did you get invited to a test screening because you preordered a ticket?

**I can not play in the beta so i wont't preorder, because i don't even know what i'm getting for my money**
I don't even know what to answer to that. There are so much videos, streams etc. out there that should be enough information to build an opinion. Also according to this, games without public betas can't be sold anymore?

**I don't get anything for preordering this game, why would i do it?**
Well that is just plain wrong. Everyone preordering will get the widowmaker skin. *But i don't care about skins!* And nobody forces you to do so, also nobody forces you to preorder the game. But to return to my movie example: 
Why do you preorder tickets for a movie that hasn't come out yet? Because it's from your favourite director or your favourite actor is starring in it and you trust them to do a good job. How will you find out if they did a good job? Either you look up critics' opinions before the movie, come to the conclusion that maybe this time the actor didn't that well and don't even watch it or you just watch the movie and find out that way. 
Why wouldn't you trust Blizzard to do well too? Why not for once show the developers some love and support and that you are hyped for the game through preordering it? [You have until 14 days AFTER the release to get a refund.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/3ruj5u/psa_if_you_preorder_through_blizzard_you_have/)
If they somehow **** up along the way you are free to go your way.

**I want to know the future payment model before i preorder this game.**
For me this is the only valid argument out there. But let's be honest, if they would introduce a P2W hero release model later on, i think the game would be dead really quick. They would also lose the trust of many players and fans. This doesn't seem like a logical outcome. It would also undermine the whole concept of counterplay by swapping through heroes, which for me is core to the gameplay and also seems to one the reason that they opted for the B2P model. 

I totally understand that game developers sometimes have to be vague. Nowadays if a game developer tells the community **A**, they see it as a promise that absolutely has to come true. But during development he finds out that **B** would be much better or **A** is just not the right option. Guess what, the 'community' doesn't care, cause the developer **'promised'** them **A**. Sometimes i feel like despite all the technolocigal achievements we are back to the Stone Age where anything you say is set in stone and you have to be careful what you say in the first place.

I'm not saying that developers or gaming companies are always right and many of them screw with their customers. But i think Blizzard so far gave us some great games and Overwatch so far looks like it will be right up there.",Overwatch,1446911609.0,t3_3rwc7a
Kiriko's Design Does NOT Match Her Personality,"Ever since Kiriko's launch Blizzard has been adding more content to tell us who she is much like every character in the game. Thing is, for most of these characters, these contents match their design and backstory or origin. That's not the case for Kiriko.  


As it seems, Blizzard is trying to push that Kiriko's personality is based in the recent Hypebeast culture. Proof of this her small snipet in her origins short that show her ""Justice Squad"", her interactions with Lucio, her line about her Bike, her new skin and the worst offender of them all: her dance emote that's a refference to how Trippie Red/Playboy Carti acts.  


What doesn't match is that her base design and gameplay don't shine any of that. Her base design has her wearing shrine kimono with leggings and thats it. Yes she does wear basketball sneakers but it's such a small part in her overall model that you can totally miss it. Her gameplay has nothing to shine it too. Kunais don't make you a Hypebeast, a protective suzu is ancient tech and doesn't make you a hypebeast, teleportation doesn't make you a hypebeast and summoning a spirit fox definetly doesn't represent as well.   


In comparison lets check the other shimadas. Genji throws Shurikens because of his ninja training, he does a quick dash and reflects due to his cybernetic enhancements and swordsmanship and summons a dragon due to this shimada heritage. Hanzo shoots detections arrows and an array of arrows in his skills to further enphasize his huntsman personality and precision, also Shimada dragon. All this is represented in their designs perfectly, something that doesn't work with Kiriko.  


Imo, the only to fix this would to either change her personality to a more formal shrine maiden (too hard and would definetly be boring) or change some of her attacks and animations to reflect her modern personality and emphasize her design (which btw i think jacket kiriko FITS WAY MORE WITH HER PERSONALITY).",Overwatch,1671019419.0,t3_zlp771
Can we agree Scatter Arrow is an unfun ability for everyone but Hanzo?,"Being headshot by a sniper is okay, there's skill to it (in most cases) and headshots don't kill tanks in one shot.

Being shot in the toe by a 10 sec cooldown ability that deals up to 450 damage and oneshots tanks does not feel skillful and does not feel fun to play against. That's 6 guaranteed picks per minute if the Hanzo can aim.

And before you mention that not all tanks get oneshotted at full health by Scatter Arrow, if the tanks are doing their jobs, they'll probably have some health missing from protecting their teammates, even 100 to 150 HP is enough to oneshot every tank in the game but D.va.

Scatter Arrow looks like an ability designed to kill enemies who were bodyshot by Hanzo and have fled around a corner. The nature of the arrows' ricochet against walls and multiplying upon hitting surfaces and having exactly 75 damage per arrow to compliment a 125 damage bodyshot shows that the developers had in mind an ability that was meant to kill 200 HP targets who were already low health.

It was NOT meant to one shot 90% of the game's heroes, including tanks. It doesn't even make sense for a sniper to oneshot a tank. The whole point of playing tanks into snipers is to give your team a hero that the snipers Can't instakill so your squishier teammates can actually fight against the sniper without instantly dying.

Hanzo throws that idea out the window with his Scatter Arrow. Of all the abilities in Overwatch, having a shotgun on a sniper makes the least sense to me. It lets him win 1v1s with characters who successfully closed the gap / flanked him despite being a sniper who, by nature, should be MORE vulnerable in close range combat.",Overwatch,1501089709.0,t3_6ppkuq
"DPS & Snipers: It's not your Supports' fault you misunderstand LoS, map positioning, and team awareness.","This is a slightly rant-y/vent-y post, but I'm still currently in the process of getting back to my correct SR range due to placements and dropping due to the influx of early season leavers and toxic players that think they're GM players but have egos and attitudes actual GM and Top 500 players don't. (Obviously this is all from a competitive view point.)

In gold, plat, and even up to diamond ranges, my friends and I have noticed that people rarely use the I Need Healing button and like to shout ""I need heals!"" over mic without their actual location in relation to the point/payload/etc. This is extraordinarily frustrating for very obvious reasons. But, the absolute worst in these ranges are those DPS and Sniper players that don't understand when to pull back or demand to be healed while in cover and completely out of LoS. Even Lucio requires LoS to heal you, you dingus. If your Ana/Mercy/Zen can't see you, they certainly can't assist you.

A recent case for example was on the middle section of Hollywood, the payload was under the bridged buildings towards the back original defense spawn, our Pharah was overly aggressive and often flying near the original defense point and then hiding on top of left building while our Widowmaker was on the opposite right building and often ducking back on the roof. Both of these players would call for heals *after* ducking out of sight and then yell and complain when both their supports would tell them that they have no vision on them. ""You have WASD, use it."" was the Widowmaker's reply from ontop of a roof that'd have to circled and then an elevator ridden while in full sight of the enemy team instead of using the bridge or going to the back of the roof so their team's Ana or Mercy could assist them. ""You have a scope and Guardian Angel."" was the Pharah's reply that was always behind a building and so far out from the payload and their tanks that even GA couldn't reach them. ~~These players complained nonstop about their support players for their own failings. Honestly, people say support players are the whiniest when they're not being ""babied"" but have you heard some DPS players?~~

Being a DPS/Sniper doesn't change the fact that this is a team game. Your positioning knowledge, knowledge of when to pull back, and knowledge of where your team is at or most likely to be at to assist you or be assisted by you is part of your job *period*. You're not risen above this as any certain class or character. Please don't be this type of player in competitive.",Overwatch,1489168485.0,t3_5ynju1

Like what? I seriously doubt those 11 kills were that consequential to the game. If you have triple the kills and triple the damage of your teammates you are better, you are literally providing more than they are and it’s shown in a clear numerical form

I literally think it’s only people that are ass at the game that say this. “Yeah my other DPS quadrupled my damage and kills, but I had 7 kills and 3 of those were the Widow that was making it hard to move up so I basically carried by taking her out!”",Overwatch,1698717450.0,t3_17ka3bj

And what’s the deal with hit-scan in general? I can’t even play Pharah anymore because it takes my rockets so much longer to hit the enemy Cassidy than it does for his bullets to hit me. With one less tank on my team this is literally a game-breaking advantage.

Blizzard really needs to fix a lot of these balance issues. I just can’t believe I never noticed how bad it was until now. Maybe just make every character a soldier with a assault rifle and some frag grenades? That should make this game finally fair again.",Overwatch,1673421071.0,t3_108yhca

Why 6v6 would have worked.,"Most people (including myself) remember the crazy oppressive metas that double tank created.

But 6v6 could have worked if the game simply had more heroes with counter abilities. More anti healing could have dealt with goats. Had they been willing to give a dps a shield piercing attacks then stacking shield wouldn’t have been as viable. Before you say that these would create their own oppressive metas, consider that this would just keep going. For every stacking oppressive ability there would be a counter and options to swap to.

Let's have a constructive conversation about Mercy and her design flaws.,"Because I feel like almost every time this hero gets brought up the conversation devolves into ""just delete her"" or ""bring back mass rez"" or some other bizarre off-shoot. 

&#x200B;

Okay, so as usual, context. I'm Halex. I'm a top 500 support and DPS player, I was originally a Mercy OTP (but since I've pretty much dropped her because Brig and Lifeweaver became viable). I feel like conversation within the Overwatch community gets really muddled and no one really wants to talk or look at both sides of the conversation. Things get dumbed down, misinterpreted, and whatever-else super quickly. In my experience as someone who has played Mercy, and someone who has played against her, I actually think there's a lot of common ground between both Mercy players and people who dislike her, and I think a lot of this could be discussed. 

&#x200B;

So before I say anything else, I want to say that I think EVERY hero has design flaws. When I say ""let's talk about Mercy's design flaws"" I'm not saying ""Mercy is the most flawed hero in the game"" or ""Res is the most flawed ability in the game"" I'm just saying that there \*are\* issues that may or may not be worse than other heroes. If you ask me, the worst designed heroes are Pharah and Lifeweaver but that's an entirely different discussion (though one I will open up people to ask me about because I love to talk). 

&#x200B;

# Res from Mercy's perspective

&#x200B;

If you've ever been high elo, talked to a high elo player, or looked at the game competitively, you'd actually know that rez is not that strong of an ability (but it IS frustrating ---we'll get to that). Purely defensive abilities that provide zero aggressive potential are *usually* not that strong at a high level. As you go up in elo the playstyle of the game shifts from punishing mistakes to pushing advantages. Defensive abilities are good at relieving pressure and undoing mistakes, but in high elo (where people make less mistakes) they become somewhat less valueable. That is not to say that they AREN'T valuable, rather that aggressive abilities such as speed boost, anti-nade, or discord simply become more valuable. 

&#x200B;

Here's the thing about rez: About 90% of the time it's a neutralizing ability. It removes an enemies advantage while not providing an advantage for your own team. A good example of this is rezzing an ally who was killed by a sniper. It doesn't provide an advantage for your own team, but it does neutralize the advantage that the enemy team gained. In situations like this, rez generally feels unrewarding, uninteresting, and unfun to use (as well as play against BUT WE WILL GET TO THAT LATER!). The other 10% of the time rez is being used mid-fight to bring back an ally that enemies had to invest resources into killing. These are your usual ""around the corner"" type rezzes. These feel far more rewarding from Mercy's perspective and they DO provide a significant advantage, but they are highly inconsistent and often risky. 

&#x200B;

It's not uncommon to see Mercy players say that they neither like nor dislike rez. I mean, an ability that's only fun 10% of the time, that you only use \~5 times per 10 minutes is not a very interactive ability. 

&#x200B;

Mercy players, in my experience, are actually not all that fond of rez. Usually the reason that they become argumentative with people who want rez removed is because of the arguments being made about the ability, which I'll get to now.

&#x200B;

# Res from an enemies perspective

&#x200B;

Res is an ability that removes the kill you worked hard for, and understandably that is going to be frustrating. The ability feels very free, it feels like a lot of unearned value, and sometimes that true. It can feel unfair. **These are all very valid criticisms**, and I can understand a lot of them even if I don't necessarily agree. 

&#x200B;

The specific talking points that I dislike (and other Mercy players also seem to dislike) have to do with requesting an LOS requirement, a movement requirement, res getting cancelled by any damage, and so on.  

&#x200B;

The issue with these requests have more to do with what they're asking rather than the reasoning that fuels it. I would be ecstatic to see res replaced with another ability (because I simply do not like it), but currently the fun part about res is entirely about being risky with it. If you remove the parts of it that allow risk, I'd rather just see it go all together. I think it's a lot more acceptable to ask that res just be removed than ask to add a bunch of stipulations that don't make it feel any better to play against in 90% of situations while also making it feel much worse for the Mercy player. Asking for these changes are a net negative: You only make the ability feel better to play against in 10% of situations (probably less because Mercy players will still figure out ways to pull off risky resses) but you make it worse to use in 100% of situations. 

&#x200B;

# Mercy's neutral game

&#x200B;

So ""neutral game"" is a term from fighting games (I think) but it's also applicable to Overwatch. Think of ""neutral"" as the poke phase, or the phase before a fight happens. A hero like Mercy is VERY strong during this phase because of how her value works. 

&#x200B;

Every hero has value, they all get it in different ways. Let's look a Winston, for example. Winston has no range and very little damage mitigation giving him a very poor neutral. IN RETURN he has an EXCEPTIONAL ""active game,"" or in other words, when a fight is really happening, he is quite strong due to his consistent AOE damage, incredible space-making abilities, and low cooldown mobility. 

&#x200B;

Mercy, on the other hand, is a hero who has almost ALL of her power in her neutral game. The amount of value that a Mercy is getting is highest when a fight hasn't happened yet. During this time she is able to provide the most damage boost, she is able to stay in the safest position, and she is able to get the most resses. When a fight has started, Mercy cannot provide anything extra that she wasn't providing in her neutral. Brig, for example, is quite good in the ""active"" phase of a fight because she provides a lot of AOE healing, some AOE damage, and provides a strong ""safe zone."" Mercy only provides damage or healing, which she already does in neutral, and she does not do this any better during a fight. 

&#x200B;

For this reason, Mercy is pretty much the worst support when a fight starts. She can survive, but otherwise she provides very little. Your goal as Mercy is to prolong the neutral phase of a fight for as long as possible by providing consistent healing, threatening damage, and undoing enemy picks for as long as possible. She's effectively the opposite of Lucio, who's goal is to shorten the neutral phase of a fight by as much as possible by providing the single best gap-closing ability in the game (yes better than Sym TP because unfortunately Sym is just a weak hero).

&#x200B;

If there is anything I've learned about overwatch players, they HATE the neutral game. When neutral is strong (poke metas) people complain a lot. Here's a short list of heroes who are usually strong/create neutral/poke metas: Roadhog, Mercy, Zenyatta, Baptiste, Sigma, Pharah, WIdowmaker, Hanzo. These are some of the most universally disliked heroes in the game. On the other hand, here are some heroes that create active/brawl metas: Lucio, Reinhardt, Genji, and so on, some very beloved heroes. 

&#x200B;

**I think Mercy could go from a hero that a lot of people dislike, to a hero that a lot of people enjoy IF her power was shifted to provide more value during active fights rather than neutral fights.** 

\-

&#x200B;

I think a lot of Mercy's issues come from a sense of ""unearned value."" Overwatch players love to talk about hero difficulty, who's harder who's easier, who deserves to be good because they're difficult... y'know. I think a lot of this discussion is kinda stupid (and also coming from people who haven't actually ventured outside of their either ""easy"" or ""difficult"" hero pools), but I can agree that when it comes down to it some heroes get more value for less effort... that being said, most of these low effort/high value heroes are also getting a lot less return on investment: The kind of value a Mercy player is getting from 1000 hours invested isn't as much as an Ana player is getting. So, when talking about changing Mercy to remove some of her free value, we also need to talk about giving her room to get MORE value from MORE investment. 

&#x200B;

If res is removed, I think it is ABSOLTULY REASONABLE to expect a new ability that provides more power at a higher ""cost"" (a stronger ability that is harder to use, in other words). 

&#x200B;

Well, what could that ability be? An ability that shifts power into Mercy's active power, an ability that provides more skill expression, and an ability that still preserves Mercy's identity as an entry-level support. Well, I'm not a game designer so I don't really know... BUT I do have some ideas and concepts. 

&#x200B;

The biggest of which, I'll quickly detail now. 

&#x200B;

**Adaptive Boost** (which takes the place of rez). 

* Adaptive Boost is a resource which Mercy gains by healing or boosting damage. It passively loses charge when not healing or damage boosting an ally
   * This is to ensure that she is using it most often when a fight is actively happening rather than during the poke phase of a fight. Since less damage happens when in neutral it would charge less during this time.
* It has a maximum duration of 3 seconds, and a minimum duration of 1 second with a 1 second cooldown between uses.
* Some minor DB/Healing nerfs accompany this introduction, but nothing major (I'd say DB down to 20% passive and healing down to 50... maybe 45 HPS seems okay, but seriously just keep reading before you write me off

&#x200B;

Now, I know this is going to make Mercy players groan, but hear me out... Add a resource to damage boost. **WAIT! Don't leave yet**. Damage boost CAN and STILL will be usable freely. If you hold down RMB damage WILL be boosted regardless of if your meter is full or not. Adaptive boost is ENTIRELY tied to it's own ability and will not inhibit the usable of Mercy's beams. 

&#x200B;

So, what will Adaptive boost do, then? 

&#x200B;

Adaptive boost increases the power of Mercy's current firing mode at the cost of a resource that is built when not using AB. 

&#x200B;

**Adaptive Boost: Healing** 

&#x200B;

* When Mercy activates adaptive boost when healing an ally she provides that ally with biotic healing for the duration.
   * Biotic energy increases healing received by 50% (does not stack)
      * *The goal of this addition is to provide Mercy with utility that SPECIFICALLY incentivizes her to heal her tank. Healing increases are less effective on lower healthpools due to their vulnerability to burst, so providing Mercy with some tank-centric utility should take some power away from pocketing DPS and move it towards sustaining her tank. Assuming Mercy's HPS was lowered to 45, this would mean that she would provide 67 HPS (same as Moira) when using this ability.* 

&#x200B;

**Adaptive Boost: Damage**

&#x200B;

* When Mercy activates adaptive boost when damage boosting an ally she provides that ally with enhanced power for the duration
   * Enhanced power increases damage boosts damage bonus from 20% to 35%. Additionally, it provides a surge of movement speed for the selected ally.
      * *The goal here is to encourage Mercy to pivot to allies depending on damage windows. For example, with this change, while you may still default to your most consistent damage ally (a 76, for example) you would be encouraged to damage boost an ally who is currently in a ""major damage window."" A few examples of this would be: Sojourn when she has her rail charged, Hanzo when he uses storm arrow, Torb during overload, Winston when he jumps on enemies, or Tracer when she's in range to do damage. The overall power of damage boost when paired with hitscan/ranged allies (who generally have stagnant damage potential) would be lower, but when paired with DPS who have burstier damage windows the power would be higher. This further removes power from pocketing and encourages Mercy to look for key damage windows. Encourages active and observant gameplay.* 

&#x200B;

**Adaptive Boost: Blaster and Staff**

&#x200B;

* When Mercy activates adaptive boost when holding out her blaster or staff (without any input) she provides herself with a burst of Valkyrie justice
   * Mercy gains infinite ammo and slightly increases fire rate for the duration. Removes cooldown penalty from your next superjump GA.
      * *Encourages Mercy to fight back against enemies (if she chooses). Provides more movement to Mercy players if they choose to use it (which I know Mercy players love), and provides a reward for Mercy players who are active about swapping weapons.* 

&#x200B;

**Adaptive Boost during Valk**

* Adaptive Boost during valk, instead of providing boosts to ALL allies, only provides the boost to the primary beam target. 
*  Additionally, the rate at which she builds resources is accumulated by all affected allies (meaning she builds it incredibly quickly during ult) 
   * *This gives Mercy more of a reason to choose the best beam target rather than the one closest to the center.*

A Mercy Main's Opinion on the Recent Healing Nerf,"*throw away because of internet feelings

As someone who has mained Mercy since launch and through all the buffs and nerfs, the rework, and additional nerfs since she was too op and as someone who will probably continue to play her, I feel that Mercy is just plain boring to play now and with the 17% decrease in her healing output, what else is left for her? 

After everything was said and done, she was always one of the most reliable healers in the game and she can’t even do anything else while she is healing. If she wants to attack, damage boost, or res, she can’t heal anymore. I always felt that her inability to do anything else while she was healing was her trade off for her insane healing output. 

To all the people saying other healers are more viable now, I laugh at that. Try solo healing as Ana. Her main defense against flankers/dive is her sleep dart and if you miss that since most of us do not have god-like aim, you’re pretty much screwed or you have to waste your grenade to try to scare them away. If you get hit by more than one enemy, which is most likely the case, you’re done. Most teams can focus down targets even IF you hit all your shots because of her long reload time and while you were busy keeping the tanks up, if you have tanks at all, your dps are wiped out crying no heals.
 
Right now, Moria is the best candidate for a new solo healer. I like her kit and she has a high survivability with her fade that can be used to escape any ult, she can heal multiple targets at a time, and can protect herself more reliably. Personally, the only reason I don’t play more Moria is because I LIKE MERCY. Her mobility and raw healing output have always drawn me to her.  

All these people complaining about Mercy being a must pick don’t complain when they have a Mercy on their team. The problem with Mercy is her Resurrect, which is what makes her popular in the higher skill levels and OWL. At this point, I am tired of all the Mercy nerfs that do NOTHING to address the true issue.

**JUST GET RID OF RES AND LEAVE HER HEALING ALONE. I’m done with it at this point. Give her something else that fits with her kit that is more interesting than bringing back a player who was probably out of position and doing something stupid when they died. I have always felt like res gives players a feeling of invincibility, Like they have this get-out-of-jail-free card reserved for when they screw up. All res does is reward bad plays and poor positioning.**

Hell, here are a few ideas that can replace it with some angelic made up names. 

1. Blessing - a heal over time, something for teammates in the backline that are taking damage but are not a priority. Think smaller Harmony orb with a duration.  

2. Invocation - something that gives a teammate a few seconds of invincibility frames.

3. Favor - a debuffer - something that can wipe out Zen’s discord orb, Ana’s grenade, crowd control, or stuns on a teammate.

4. Divine Knowledge - something similar to Sombra’s passive Opportunist - something that lets her know for a brief window who is at critical health and where they are - an ability that ties into Mercy’s role as a shot caller.


^Blizzard, ^please, ^take ^your ^pick. ^Really, ^I ^don’t ^mind.

P.S. if you have any cool abilities you think would be better suited than res, I would like to hear them. 

tldr: stop messing with her healing and get rid of the real problem, res.

*edited for formatting :)

*adding comment I made below about why I think this is a huge nerf *Why I feel it is a big deal is that her healing is tied to everything she does. This means she won't generate ult as fast because she is not healing as much and she won't be damage boosting as often because she has to keep up with healing. Most of the time, people you are healing are being targeted by more than one person. So while you can't negate Winston anymore, that was never really the problem. It's when you have a Winston and a D.va dive bombing the back line when you have a problem but most of the time you could get away with it because their aim was shit and you could out heal their accuracy.*",Overwatch,1532003096.0,t3_905doh

Your account can be banned based on the number of reports alone.,"If you can remember me, yes I'm the guy who posted Attack Symmetra on this very subreddit. During my play since then, I've been having a bad streak of games, and at the end, I have received 7 days ban. Let me be clear now that Blizzard did not disclose the specific reason or occurrence that prompted this ban. I was engaged in appeal process for the past 2 days until I was given this response (exact copy and paste since, for some reason, I cannot take a screenshot): **Please refer to Edit 7**

**[Redacted]**
I do not know why game license only shows me WoW1, since I don't even play the game.

The issue still stands that you guys banned me based solely on my choice of hero, attack Symmetra, and that is simply absurd. Long story short, here's my reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4rz48m/attack_symmetra_works_surprisingly_well_thoughts/, and it currently has 92 upvotes with only 4 dissenting opinions among 29 comments. As for the gameplay itself, I played, I didn't played in style that'd put my teammates on intentional disadvantage, and most of all, I've played based on what best suites on maps and situations. I played most as Symmetra, yes, because that's something I can safely say what I'd be most confident with, what I know to be effective based on my assessment of the moment, and most importantly, what I can benefit the team the most with my experience with the game. I don't know what exactly compelled you to incur this ban, but tell me what it is and I can give you a very reasonable explanation and in no way I deserved this ban, not especially as this ""gameplay offense.""

Hey there!
An additional review of the action has been completed. We have confirmed our initial findings, and the action will not be reversed or changed.
We understand that you may still have concerns regarding the action, but we must reiterate that it was taken to address a violation of the Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/), which all players accept before logging into the game.
We understand that these policies may seem harsh, but they are in place to ensure that every player is able to enjoy their time in our games. Thank you for respecting our position.

Please, as I have voiced my dissent last time similar issue arose, if you do not clarify what exactly prompted as violation of this user agreement, I can only assume I have nothing to fault myself for and your decision is arbitrary, thus only can continue my said behavior without a hope of fixing it, though I cannot think of anything I might've done between silencing and this one to deserve any of this. So to clarify, as far as I'm concerned and my knowledge of the situation goes, this punishment is to retaliate my choice of hero and play style of the game, regardless of its effectiveness or strategy behind it or the manner I've played the game with full participation and effort. And I will still get punished because the mass who thinks they got all the knowledge in the world to judge other's decision deems my hero unfit for whatever they're claiming. Again, please you have to clarify if I got that wrong.

*This ticket was marked as Resolved.*

**TL;DR** on that exchange, ""This action has been taken in accordance with our Code of Conduct (http://battle.net/support/article/7525)""

Aside from the fact that I was never given a slightest reference of my conduct that warrants the ban (and save the argument Blizzard don't have to disclose that information), that Code of Conduct which the representative referenced consists of violations regarding usage of vulgar language in chat or in ID tag, or any use of third party program that gives unfair advantage.  None of them I've committed as far as I can tell, with a good reason to believe myself so. I rarely engage in conversation because 

* 1. I don't have microphone, and
* 2. due to the fast paced nature of the game, I find simply playing than engaging in chat more productive, so I actively avoid chatting if I can help it, and 
* 3. I was a long time player of LoL, and I have it engraved in me altercations are simply no-no and that it's better to mute and move on. The cheating part is not even worth mentioning. I DO NOT CHEAT, period.

Naturally, I couldn't accept this and move on, since 7 days ban is not something to get killed over, but it is a punishment nonetheless that was given to me based on, as far as the reference I was given, something that I couldn't have violated.

So I made further inquiry using customer service. This is the exchange: *http://imgur.com/a/SwQAN*

**TL;DR**, and because the upload somehow distorted the image,

* 1. the moderators simply check if the reports are not compiled in abusive manner. Example;)a pre-made makes arbitrary reports on one guy to troll him. 
* 2. The rest is automated system that makes decision based on the number of reports compiled, only. Hence, the claim: ""the community decides on whether a conduct is legit or not.""


On detail, the system currently underlines that Overwatch punk-busting relies heavily, if not entirely, upon the number of reports compiled, and the actual conduct or content of a gameplay is not considered. In other words, this whole exchange translates to, ""Even if you make your decisions based on the legitimate assessment of situation, and your capability, efficiency, and proficiency justifies your choice, you will get punished regardless.""

Let me be very clear, and I quote myself on this, 
> ""I didn't played in style that'd put my teammates on intentional disadvantage ... I've played based on what best suites on maps and situations ... something I can safely say what I'd be most confident with, what I know to be effective based on my assessment of the moment, and most importantly, what I can benefit the team the most ...""

Furthermore,  I have not made any comments with expletives, I have not engaged in any arguments, and most importantly, I have not made any play that would render me as a troll since I was corrected the last time similar happened.

The guy at Blizzard CS was stubborn enough to notify me I cannot get the penalty removed regardless, but he still passed on the note to higher ups so I can get some clarification on the issue.

That all said, let me tell you why this is such a problematic situation that potentially affects all players. It is in no way a valid punishment, let alone a valid system to begin with, when it entirely relies on assumption, **""whatever the case maybe, anything to earn this threshold of dissent must've done something wrong.""** In this particular case, I've gotten so much negativity because of my unorthodox choice of hero in certain situations, which, by the way, seems not entirely out of touch based on 92 upvotes and 25 positive comments on that specific pick. Anyone know, when people deny the fact that others might be simply doing better than them, they are prone in seeking a scapegoat, and what better to blame than that guy playing something unheard of? It is an unfortunate side effect of playing something unorthodox, but that does not warrant a punishment in any way, and any sane moderator of any game should avoid punishing anyone based on that unless that's exactly what you as a game moderator and designer specifically want to enforce on your player base. It got really worse fast in my case because I play Overwatch in solo que. Imagine one guy says ""it's all this guy's fault,"" and you are on your own to defend yourself. You will be overwhelmed, and don't lie to me or yourself by thinking otherwise, especially when you get in a team with premade. Even if you aren't punished now as I got for playing something unorthodox, it is simply something that's bound to happen sooner or later, because what Blizzard sees is the number of reports compiled, not the actual conduct that prompted the report.

In the exchange, the rep acknowledges my claim, ""the community can voice dissent and make that shown through reports, but it is still Blizzard that make those dissent valid by passing on the actual punishment, I.e. community claims, Blizzard confirms. Then it is simply unfair to make that final verdict only based on number of reports compiled,"" and suggested I post this on the official forum to get the feedback going(which I cannot because ban extends further than games to official forum).

Look, in the end, I'm not trying to vilify anyone or calling out ""the community"" to be wrong. As I have acknowledged in the exchange with the rep, the community can voice their opinion and dissent, regardless of how mixed up that opinions are. But the case and point still stands in regards to my innocence of the issue; since I cannot get access to my account I don't know where my stats at, but last time I checked my win rate on about 30 hours Symmetra was 59%, and that should at least give me some credit over my claim that I choose her because I believe I can play better, the situation allows it, and my tactics do work for the most. I also confirmed Blizzard server do keep the record of individual plays, so that should clarify I have not engaged in any activity that would place my team at an intentional disadvantage. It also should make it clear that I have not violated ANY Code of Conduct.

This should come as a legitimate feed back, if not a legitimate plea for reconsideration. There's an inherent flaw to your system when it relies on number of reports, or when you simply let the throng to decide the validity of others conduct. This is a competitive game, and people are inherently frustrated due to that nature. And you simply cannot let frustrated individuals to make judgement nor should you rely on such judgement since they are more likely to be skewed and irrational. You don't even have to bring up science to know that's not a basis of a sound decision. I'll be sticking around to see if I can get an actual reply of moderator on this, and shed some light in to the issue. Most hopefully, I get my ban repealed. If not, I still do hope to see what I actually did wrong so I can correct my behavior, and that's obviously other than simple, ""Because this many people claimed so.""

**Edit1:** Here's the link to my Attack Symmetra post: *https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4rz48m/attack_symmetra_works_surprisingly_well_thoughts/*, simply as a reference to upvote and the ""community"" opinions toward it. out of 29 comments, 4 had voiced a dissent to my choice of pick, which half of them are written in understandable manner and makes a good point.

**Edit2:** Perhaps I should add **TL;DR** to the entire post.

* 1. I play an unorthodox hero for certain maps and situations, based on my judgement of the situation, map, and need. To claim that I have my own base for the judgment, I have win-rate of nearly 60% last time I checked with that hero.
* 2. I've received a ban about 2 days ago, so I've been appealing the penalty. In the end, my case was forcibly closed, and no explanation or reference to my conduct was given. I was referenced to Blizzard's Code of Conduct (http://battle.net/support/article/7525), but none that the code governed could be applied to my case, as far as I was concerned.
* 3. So I moved on to appeal through customer service, and during the exchange, I found out Blizzard was penalizing based on the number of reports compiled (hence the representative claimed, ""the community decides the action"").
* 4. To my argument, and I quoted:
>""the community can voice dissent and make that shown through reports, but it is still Blizzard that make those dissent valid by passing on the actual punishment, I.e. community claims, Blizzard confirms. Then it is simply unfair to make that final verdict only based on number of reports compiled,""
The representative told me that's a valid feedback and I should post that to a forum where moderators monitor for those kind of things.
* 5. Hence this post.

**Edit3:** You are rightfully skeptical, but let me be clear to everyone. During my playthrough between my latest ban and the one before, which I was punished for already, I have not engaged in any conduct that should flag me as a troll, and I am very confident with this claim. If I were to be proven wrong, then I gladly accept the consequence and WILL correct myself on this post and all my future game forward. As much as I understand mistakes can be made with Blizzard, I understand that I too can make mistakes the same. I do not claim to be 100% right, and I also do not claim Blizzard is 100% wrong, as well.

**Edit4:** I feel the need to clarify a bit. I do not claim that I am always 100% friendly and explain EVERYTHING before a game starts. **However, I don't simply instalock.** If I can help it, most of the times, when in maps that I suspect enemy Torb or Bastion, I tell my team I will switch if they don't have those heroes set up for defense. **STILL** most of the times I get harassed. Also, as I said before, I have my own base for judgement and it should be backed by the win rate to at least certain degree. I don't claim to be the master, but I still do claim to be a journeyman at least among many.

**Edit5:** Please, you are indeed entitled to your opinion, but if you want to claim Symmetra is a bad pick, do so in my other post. **This post is mostly about giving Blizzard's punishment system a feedback and I mention my Symmetra in hopes of shedding some light to the case and to use it as a reference to show I had my reasons to play her and it was not out of will to troll my teammates. This is very important you guys realize this.**

**Edit6:** Regarding those who suspect troll plays, I already said no I didn't do it since the previous punishment dealt with it. I make it clear in the live chat exchange, so please stop cherry picking. Also, you can doubt if it only happened twice or more. As far as I remember it, the one that I made a mistake happened at the back stairs on Hanamura A, and even my teammates acknowledged that it was a mistake, and later I believe my team won the game with me winning silver for most time on objective. The other one yes I did it on purpose after learning you could actually troll with that. Again, I don't hastly rule out the fact that I could be wrong. However, I've already got punished for it and this has nothing to do with those as far as I understand from my exchange with the Live chat representative. Also, I've never claimed I'm the most innocent person in the world. I had my shameful moments, and frankly I did not hide that anywhere in my post. If you think I did, please point out and I'll gladly rephrase. Again, please refer to **EDIT 5** and **EDIT 1** if you are really compelled to talk about Attack Symmetra, and how you feel it works.

**Edit7** Rebooting fixed my screenshot issue. Here's the link to the ticket exchange: http://imgur.com/a/VXThK

**Edit8:** I found out my post was tagged with *misleading*. I subsequently sent r/Overwatch moderators that my post is not, and wish to know at least why it got the tag. Here's copy of the message:

>I've got my post on misleading for saying, ""You can be banned based on the number of reports alone,"" in the title. That title is not misleading, as that information was received directly from the Blizzard CS Representative. 

>AGSHEKELOH 10:51:24
Gotcha, I apologize if this situation is a bit vague. With Overwatch penalties, though, **those are essentially an automated system as they are applied based on reports from other players.** We essentially allow the game community to govern itself. So on that note **the most I can really comment is that there was an excessive number of reports on this account concerning griefing / trolling / non-pariticipation.**
At the end of the day though, a player can report some one for any reason they feel is valid. **We have checks in place to prevent abuse of the reporting system, but ultimately like I said, the community governs itself.**
Correct, we review those reports to ensure the system isn't being abused to specifically target someone unjustly. **But aside from that, we allow the community to decide what they feel should not be in the game.** Like I said though, upon review of this situation, this penalty will not be removed.

Those requests are a bit difficult to nail down. **Like I said, penalties are applied on a threshold. Even for chat violations we need multiple reports from multiple unique accounts. A single report for a single situation generally won't result in anything.** But, with that being said, based on what I see in these reports, the community as a whole seems to disagree with both your style of play and your refusal to change it in light of the matches veering towards losses. **Again, that's based on what these reports are mentioning, we in customer support cannot see what exactly transpired in a particular match.**

I could pull out a very few other references upon your request, but I think those are the most prevalent statements to disqualify the *misleading* tag. So I'd like that tag to be removed, or if not, I would like to know, at least, why that tag was attached to my post.

Why don’t some supports realize that their healing stat is a function of the enemies damage output?,"It boggles my mind how many supports will claim they “carried a game” because they had a high healing stat, or that they’re not at fault because they had more healing with the enemy healers

Like dude if our DPS are widowmaker and hanzo, and the enemies are bastion and junkrat - they’re just going to do more damage to our tank, while our DPS will be looking to make execution picks on the squishies. Of COURSE you’ll have more healing 😭

A support carries the game by using the utilities they have (e.g. huge anti-nades, stopping ults with rally or trance or beat, saving with immort, or getting key rezzes). Just because you pumped heals into the tank all game doesn’t mean you carried or are not at fault for a loss",Overwatch,1682343630.0,t3_12xg6nq

Nothing can be more centric than Genji meta was. Also, how will bastion be any more centric than Reins shield, or Ana, or lucio speed boost, or graviton. Of course there are going to be centric tools and heroes. Fucking duh. The only difference is that it takes more than 3 damn seconds to figure out a way to deal with bastion. 

Learn how to counter him. Its not impossible. Bastions Sentry is a gimmick, and like every gimmick, there are ways to beat / stop it. Maybe instead of crying and bitching and moaning when hes been live for LESS THAN AN HOUR, you could actually put in some work and figure out how to deal with it. Current bastion is in no way, shape, or form worse than pre-nerf Genji / Genji meta. Genji meta was LITERALLY ""whoever has the best Genji wins"".

"Unpopular Opinion: Roadhog is not dead, he is exactly where he should be","Most people will downvote this without reading, so for those of your who stick around to read it, I appreciate it. 

Roadhog's new nerf makes him more team reliant for his hook to consistently land kills. Everyone and their brother seems to be complaining that this has ""killed"" Roadhog. In my opinion, this is exactly how a character like Roadhog should have been from the get go. 

Sure, he alone cannot one shot people but tanks are not meant to be that way. Do people not understand how powerful the sheer ability to displace enemies in the midst of a team fight is? On a map like Oasis, getting pulled into the enemy team's cluster will result in eminent death. Roadhog just now HAS to have other people to do it. 

I always thought Roadhog's initial design was a mistake, but Blizzard somehow managed to find a middle ground that allows him to stay the same and fit the narrative of a team based game. The only complaints I see about this nerf are people complaining that they can no longer get a free kill every 8 seconds. 

I feel you. I used to use Roadhog to easily dominant in games where my DPS and Support skills weren't cutting it. I got drunk one night and dominated as Roadhog. Anyone who can dominate with a character they have 1 hour on while drunk is not good. 

People also always seem to bring up the fact that he isn't heavily played in tiers like GM or on the pro scene. Well, most players are not at that tier of play. Some people have multiple accounts up there so the amount diminishes even more. Roadhog' design was hostile to what Blizzard has promoted as a team game, so this nerf suits him as far as I'm concerned. ",Overwatch,1498060870.0,t3_6imr2y
Lucio is now boring. Please here me out. Blizzard made a huge mistake.,"*Hear me out. Here. Thanks. x)

Hey guys, Science here.

I.. um.. i played a lot of Lucio. Really, a lot. I was one of those aggro-Lucios you see since day one. Literally, since day one.

So.. Blizzard just gutted his range by factor 9. He now heals in 10m-range. Thats nothing. **Meis beam are 15.**

At the same time they upped his heals, but his heales never mattered in high-level-comp. At all. Like, in master+, you always used tempo in 85% of the time. And now here is the thing. When you used 85% tempo, you actually had to land a lot of shots with him, to get that ult in time. Due to the projectile-nature of his primary fire, you'd try to engage closerange with him.

Thats what he has the wallrides for. So he can get out of too-close-situations.

Thing is: He can't afford to leave his team now, anymore. At all. Ever. All he is supposed to do now, is get to the point fast, and heal. Well, thats not what Lucio-mains *always did*. You went out there and contributed, distracted their ana, did whatever, *while helping your team*. If you are **just** distracting their ana, you do nothing but feed ults for every shot they land on you. 

He brings no value into a team-fight situation where you use him as solely dps. Which you would do in a range his gun is effective in, because all your other teammates aren't as mobile and must stay midrange-ish behind.

If you played Lucio for hundreds of hours, you didn't sit next to your ana and idle for the timespan you'd play the game in. And it doesnt make sense to incentivize this playstyle. But thats exactly what Blizzard does. His Boop-Buff, his wallrides, his self-speed, thats all incentivizing gameplay that is **bad** the way ult-charges work.

You'd already play a more passive Lucio in the very high end of the ladder, because you can't afford to dance around GM-McCrees. But you'd *make use of your kit* whenever you could.

This passive 'i'll stand next to people and heal them', that *was never fun*. So, to incentivize a more interactive playstyle.. Blizzard now forces us to do exactly that? What the hell?!

I don't understand this. I don't understand why you buff Lucios heals. I don't understand why his musics affective range is 2/3 of meis freezing-beam. You *destroyed* him, and people are cheering up for it.

You shred the Lucio-main experience, but **in favor of what? Of a MORE passive healer who is MORE restricted**. 

#the people who found him boring to play before will feel exactly the same way now, and the people who enjoyed playing him before, will now be a burden to their team if they don't change their playstyle.

#Here is what you do in Master+ as Lucio now: You stand behind your tank and use e on cooldown. Until it says 'Match complete'. Wow, much skill required. Thanks for these changes. Amazing.

Overwatch is one of the most toxic games I have played.,"For reference, I'm a GM support player and I have boosted handful of accounts for fun. In my experience, from Silver to GM, (Never played bronze games) toxicity has been a problem, more noticeably in Platinum, Diamond, and Master. 

I had my fair share of thrower and tilted players in my GM games but my god, is it common in the lower SR. I think that's a problem with Overwatch that needs addressing. The game is fun, but I personally do not enjoy playing after a year. Each season, it just gets worse.T here's nothing in place to limit the toxic nature in people who do not want to play to win. 

I hear from friends that told me there are more toxic games out than Overwatch. Mainly, the MOBA games like LoL, DOTA2 and Smites. Is this what we should expect Overwatch to be because it's MOBA/FPS?

People are grossly overexaggerating how bad the battle pass is,"The popular opinion on this sub seems to be that the battle pass (more specifically having heroes on tier 55) will completely ruin the game.

There are a lot of reasons why this is wrong.

&#x200B;

**Completing weekly challenges will literally give you enough overwatch coins to get the battle pass every time there's a new hero.**  

You can earn up to 60 OW coins by completing weekly challenges. The new content every season (9 weeks) alternates between a new map and a new hero. Meaning that it will take 18 weeks from when a new hero comes out to when another new hero comes out. 18x60=1080. You can literally get the premium battle pass every time a new hero comes out, instantly unlocking them. I do not know how to simplify this more. **Simply completing the weekly challenges will allow you to unlock the premium battle pass when a new hero comes out, instantly unlocking them.**

&#x200B;

I understand that this won't work for Kiriko. But it still changes nothing. 99.99% of people reading this are already owners of overwatch 1. This means that you will unlock Kiriko instantly! But what about the new people who don't have overwatch 1? Well, they still have **THIRTY-FOUR** characters to play. Everyone always ignores this. If you're a new player, sure- you'll have to grind for kiriko. But if you're a new player, you *also* have 34 characters to play that you've never seen before. By the time you will have tried each character for 30 minutes, you'll have grinded enough to unlock her.

Discussion: Hidden Matchmaker Patches Create Win/Loss Streaks,"Hello my friends, I am back and wanting to inform you of something suspicious I am almost certain is happening in Overwatch for over six season now, specifically after patches implemented causing issues with the matchmaker. I will do my best to be specific and avoid any type of speculation, I will tell you what I believe is happening and then ask for user feedback and we can see what truth comes out. If this thread is locked as my previous thread was where I explain to you exactly how matchmaker work:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7hb05p/i_have_finally_done_it_i_have_understood_the/ 
  
 then we can draw our own conclusion to what that means, they do not want us talking about it.  
  &nbsp;

Here we go: We all know that the matchmaker is calibrated at the start of the season with placement matches, which help move people more quickly to their appropriate rank if they play better or worse than last season. So now I am saying  to you that I strongly believe that the matchmaker is calibrated at end of season with hidden updates in the patches that **force win streaks or loss streaks based on where a player individual statistic deem they should be before the season ends**, let me go further and explain exactly what I mean by this and how you can identify it yourself, because I understand at first this is hard to believe.  
&nbsp;
 
To be specific, I believe the patch that was release on 04/10/2018 included matchmaker calibration. **Do you recall that there was big problem with matchmaker after patch on 04/10/2018 when you would play competitive match and no gain sr for win?** Here are links to prove this was happening for around 8 hours:

There are many more reports (at least 20, each full of people verifying this to be true). A problem like this could not happen unless changes to matchmaker occur, yet no changes to matchmaker are listed in patch notes. This by itself is strange, however **many people even said that matchmaker indicate they were in placement matches**. This point I am saying is that changes were made to matchmaker to recalibrate players ranks in competitive much faster than by just playing regular competitive matches, **and now many people report huge loss/win streak [800-+ SR) is happening**, here are just a few reports:

There are countless posts creating claiming the same **happening right after patch**. Here it goes further. Just yesterday 04/23/2018 there is a new patch, here is the input I need:  
&nbsp;

- Did any of you notice a significant loss or win streak after patch on 04/10/2018? Describe this for us.
- With the new patch released yesterday 04/23/2018, please play some games and see if you have sudden streak in opposite direction and let us know below.


&nbsp;   
I am almost certain that these hidden matchmaker updates force you to a rank by creating scenarios of huge streaks where you cannot lose, or huge win streaks where you cannot win causing so much frustration in players. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
I want to ensure you that I am not saying that this is somehow evidence, I am speculating based on many reports from people and what I have observed, however I am quite confident that this is happening. Now let us hear the feedback and see if we can find the truth of this.

Blizzard has ruined my favorite hero.,"I didn't realize the changes to lucio were so extreme. I feel ridiculously strong with the new damage/projectile speed and faster wall-riding but the hero is boring to play now. With the new radius it's basically impossible to do any cool wallrides anymore. Whenever I wallride over a measly 10 meters my team stops receiving my aura. What kind of crummy aura range is this? At least give it infinite vertical reach so we can use our abilities properly.

Stop complaining about counter-picking,"The overwatch community complain about a lot of things but the thing I have heard some of the most stupid complaints about is counter picking with things such as:

“I hate when people counter pick me, I’m just trying to have fun”

“Counter picking is admitting someone else is better than you”

“It’s stupid that people counter pick me and swap off their favourite character just to make me have less fun”

I have heard loads of other things as well but these are the main three I have heard and although some of them have a basis, people whine and exaggerate these ideas sometimes.

1. Hating being counter picked is understandable and wanting to have fun is great but the other person also wants to have fun and if playing their hero into yours isn’t fun for them, then swapping into a hero that they think would be more fun to play into you makes sense.

2. No, just because someone swapped into you that does not mean you’re better than them. In some cases it does mean your skill is better on your character is better than them on theirs but like sometimes your character does just counter theirs. Some may argue that if you can’t beat people playing your characters weaknesses then that’s a skill issue but then that logic has to go both ways, especially if you hate counter picking.

3. I hate this last one. “Counter picking is admitting someone else is better than you”, so? Like ok sure you can say that but what’s your point? If Im against a player who’s better than me Im gonna counter pick because overwatch games are more than just battles of skill but battles of choices so Im gonna make as many choices as I can to get the upper hand especially if Im against a better player.

1. It’s simplifies the game in a way that both teams have to rally around their singular tank. We’ve all played games with teammates breaking off without solid execution. 

2. Tanks are going to be stronger based off buffs and the fact 2 healers are focused on them. Which means they can get much more creative with the tanks. Double shield will be a thing of the past and maybe characters like Orisa can be buffed without fear of becoming the Meta again.

3. Other characters like Brig could benefit from this. Her and Rein joining shields could be fire",Overwatch,1621549726.0,t3_nhdda3

KIRIKO's health should be NERFED 200 > 175,"As a support main myself I should admit that flanking as Kiriko feels extremely safe and forgiving. She has high vertical mobility due to her passive. High horizontal mobility due to TP. Invulnerability that cleanses your mistakes. She also has thin hitbox, maybe similr to Tracer.

It's actually simple to engage someone from off-angle, 2 tap HS in close range and give yourself extra chance by throwing suzu. Welp, if I haven't succeeded I simply TP the f outta here. Repeat.

My take is that her health should get lower. This way she'll have to think twice before boldly engaging others. Instead of nerfing her crit dmg or suzu, let her be glass cannon support.

Then you get the hero options, for the rebels you have Winston and Hammond (terrible options for the style of mode) ashe and tomb (on ATTACK) and then for support you have Baptiste and lucio, baps fine, lucio sucks

Many people on that sub defend xQc, because they understand that he is a very passionate player who wants to win games. A lot of people on this sub need to realize that Blizzards actions are very unfair.

xQc has been witch-hunted on this sub two days ago because of that Reddit post and if it weren't for that post, he would not have been suspended. xQc is being scapegoated because he is ""one of the role-models"" of the game.

Unpopular Opinion: I don't mind the new Hog,"Personally, he feels fine to me. It's true he doesn't have the same omph to him that people liked about him, but I think these changes make him a much more fluid. It changes his role a lot, and personally, I think it's for the better.

He used to be very burst DPS based. It used to be that you had high value kill potential every 8 seconds, and the rest of your time was just spamming until you could hook again.

Now, his kit doesn't revolve around the hook as much. It's still a major part of his kit, but without the one-shot potential, it's more of a clean up tool for lower health enemies. He now has a lot more focus on using his scrap gun. The quicker fire rate and higher ammo means its a much better strategy to spam the hell out of shields and chokes, and you're much more effective at it too considering the higher fire rate. So he is in a different class now, much more focused on the spam and consistent damage, but I think it's closer to the kind of role the devs originally wanted Hog to play.

Saying that I do agree his damage feels a touch low, but it's a step in the right direction.

tl;dr I have nothing wrong with the new Hog. Yes, he is different from the current one, with a lot less focus on the hook. His damage may be a bit low. But I think it's a good direction for the character.

Edit: as many of you so tactfully put, he does have lower dps so ""He's worse at spamming chokes and shields"" but it's not that he provides more damage int them, but the damage is more consistent.",Overwatch,1498042847.0,t3_6il38v
Unpopular Opinion: OW2 is great,"Since most I've seen in this subreddit is people complaining about how bad the game is I thought I'd share my opinion.

The Beta hasn't even been running for a week, and yet so many strongly believe they have gathered enough information to definitely say that the game is bad. The amount of people saying ""I've played two games of OW2, then went straight back to OW1"" is just mind boggling! How on earth do you think you have a well-informed opinion after two games of quick play? It's very possible you got unlucky and your teams were just bad and you can hardly blame the game for people going Pepega trying out new/changed heroes. But rest assured, the game will (have to) go through huge changes until the final release. 

Next, the support dilemma. Yes, supports are underwhelming right now and difficult to play. But it's simply not enough anymore to stand out in the open, click heal onto your Tanks and ult every once in a while. You have to position yourself in a way that allows you to support your team but doesn't expose you too much. I've often read that support mains miss the off tank peeling for them. They did that? I've played a lot of Ana in my time and usually my off tank was in the enemy spawn feeding. I think now at least one DPS has to care for the supports. For them it's also not enough anymore to blindly click on enemies, but they have to support their supports if they want to win games.

Which brings me to my main point. A lot of complaints I read were ""but my Tanks are overextending, but my DPS are not peeling"" etc. This is not your fault and I want you to understand that. You can be a god tier player, if your team mates play the game wrong, you'll lose games. I've learned to be critical with myself but also to see when my team just didn't wanna win and that helped me deal with tilt I was experiencing a lot. Overall it seems to me like in OW2 teamplay is going to be even more important than in the live build. Is this a bad thing though? I think not, since if you just want to pop off individually you can play COD or similar games. Overwatch is, was and hopefully always will be a team game. Enforcing more teamplay can hardly be a bad thing then. People will slowly learn that they cannot pop off individually as much anymore and general gameplay will change with time, I'm certain.

Other than that, I think Blizzard did an amazing job with this Beta. It runs fairly stable, I've only had crashes once (which for a Beta is amazing). The updated visuals are nice, even though I will say that I'll have to get used to them since sometimes I just can't see the enemy. But with time and experience that'll change too. The updated sounds might just be my favourite thing though. Clicking heads as Widow has never felt better. Hanzo's Bow now sounds like an actual bow and with Ana I just feel like the most powerful Assassin on the battlefield, just because the gun feels so nice. Blizzard managed to make every hero, even the rather unchanged ones, feel just a little bit different and I've had a blast figuring out their new place in this new game.

Money side of OW2,"I am a finance major, have audit experience and I will say that 99% of people here seem to have 0 clues on how businesses operate.


Overwatch 1 spoiled all of you, and died because of that.

Overwatch was a single purchase 50$ game with too generous lootbox system. It had limited opportunity to generate funds for further development. This model is not good for games that require long term support, since they need constant money inflow. 

Videogames do not have significant variable costs. They have enormous fixed costs. Servers, salaries, rent, software license just to name a few. So even after initial sales, the costs stay the same.

This model is great for single player games, because they don't need much support after release, maybe some bugfixes and that's it.


But games like Overwatch cannot survive long only on initial sales funds. No matter how much money it generated on initial sales, eventually the costs will exceed the sales and they will have to cut costs. This means less people working on the game, less  updates, less care for the game.

This is why OW2 was launched initially. To bring funding to the team. Akin to how Call of Duty instead of supporting 1 game, launches 15 cods so they have constant flow of money. I believe you would not want Overwatch 3, ow4, ow5 in cod fashion.


Then they decided to adopt F2P model, which is a MUCH better model for long term support of a game like Overwatch, because of constant generation of money. They don't need to cut costs, they are incentivised to work on new content, new skins, new modes, they are incentivised to engage players.

They give you Constant updates, new heroes, new maps, new modes, new events not because they owe you something. But because f2p model allows them to do so.


New team so far has been great. Jared is a very down to earth guy and is able to keep Aaron from making the same mistakes Jeff did. He insisted on dev blogs, community engagement and did a lot to make the game better managed.

Tl.dr.

F2P model is necessary for long term support of the game and constant updates. OW1 was destined to fall.",Overwatch,1699109994.0,t3_17nnfxi

So would the Mcree skin be as cool if every single game everyone has it? I don't think so.

Anyone Else Think Hammond Is Stupid & Cheesy?,"I might be in the minority but I was really hoping for something cool like the Omnic champion gladiator robot from Junkertown or the Junkerqueen. Everyone was calling for a hamster and now that it is revealed it seems like it's all a joke.

I am finding the direction in which the game is going is kind of dull and cheesy. I know this game is more focused for kids, but I feel like the Overwatch world would have a lot more potential if it went a slightly more darker/noir route. I find a superhero world would be much more fascinating and realistic if it had that Christopher Nolan vibe. Most of the characters seem all uppy or happy, like Mei, Tracer, Lucio. There's nothing wrong with that, I enjoy playing those heroes. But even the evil characters or the darker ones, seem just, really, unexciting/cheesy/generic like Reaper or Junkrat.

I'm sure Hammond will be fun to play with his wrecking ball. It is really cool concept, and the hamster/wrecking ball combo can work but I feel like they need to add some more dark/ominous characters into the game to balance everything out. The villains don't even seem like villains. I would have never guessed Sombra was a villain.

I also think about how OW can potentially turn into some big thing like Marvel and get into movies or TV series down the line if they build it up right, but I don't think that can happen if they stick with their current vibe, unless they want to get into cartoons.",Overwatch,1530218484.0,t3_8un7it

in 5v5 it is so much easier to synergize and be on the same page. 12 to 10 players is so much easier to get the information you need to execute a plan. where 6v6 feels like too much information and visual clutter and all you can do is react to all of that being in your face. i think 5v5 gives a lot more space to come up with a plan and execute it as a team even in lower lobbies

Out of the 100+ players in Overwatch League there are Zero Women.,"I don’t care that this will be downvoted to oblivion and that my account will get spammed with vitriol, this needs to be said. 




For everyone who is going to comment “show me the women who should be in the league”: 


1. They are out there, if you were even remotely paying attention to this game since launch you would know of the legendary incident with Geguri destroying as Zarya with an 80% winrate. 


2. There is nothing innately gendered about the skills it takes to be good at this game, so even if there was no women who are qualified to be in the league, it’s not because they are not skilled enough, it’s because for one reason or another they are not pursuing a career. 


3. Saying women “don’t want to play this game” is objectively untrue. There are a plethora of reasons that women did play this game but stopped and nearly zero of the reasons why are that Overwatch isn’t appealing to play to women. I mean come on, half the characters are women! While it’s anecdotal evidence, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say most women who play this game have faced some kind of harassment based on their gender which absolutely contributes to women turning away from playing.




I know plenty of women who play this game and plenty of women who would like to play this game but don’t because of the constant harassment. It’s like every other week we see a video of a woman streaming in competitive and they are just faced with a barrage of insults. Overwatch should be for everyone; it prides itself in the diversity in it’s characters and lore, but in real life this game is still dominated by the same toxicity that other gaming communities are consumed by. This is another example of that; by selecting exclusively men for overwatch league there is a subtle implication that women are not allowed to take gaming seriously as a career, and are not allowed to play Overwatch in the same competitive way that men are. 




In short, women are not respected in the same way that men are in gaming. 




This is a chronic problem that we talk about all the time here on the subreddit, but I don’t see any improvement. There are a ton of factors at play here, but we need to work together as a community to rectify this because this kind of nepotism and gate keeping in the pro scene is not just preventing Overwatch’s potential, it’s inhibiting eSports in a larger scope as well. By being exclusionary we are really stopping ourselves from becoming a crazy huge juggernaut phenomenon that I want to share with everyone because I love Overwatch, and I want all my friends and other people to love it too.

Dear OW2 Community…,"Why do so many players post screenshots of their losing streaks, acting like they are victim of some big conspiracy against them? When I was a kid and I was losing in a video game, I didn’t go cry to my parents all the time, let alone the internet. I just tried my best again, and again, and again and eventually I would win. In that process my mechanical skills would improve, I developed new strategies and I deepened my understanding of the game and looking back, it was that sense of personal growth what kept me playing, not just winning.

I’m not a fan of the matchmaking myself and I felt screwed over more than a couple times, but I can’t wrap my head around why anyone would want to post their losing streak of 4 with the title „Dear blizzard f you“.
Maybe you just had bad day? Unlucky? Enemy team got lucky? Or they also lost 3 games in a row and also really wanted to win and it was a gg?
If you can’t take the losses and even expect people to feel sorry for you, you also rob yourself of the joy of winning games… because then surely the wins must be rigged too?

Now a question for everyone who’s not triggered by my opinion and already typing an angry response:
Do you think maybe the core gameplay style of Overwatch, we all like so much, just breeds this kind of behavior? I think being so dependent on your team and not having all the information at all times, tends to make players, who don’t understand that, feel like they are either carrying or their teammates are throwing.

Flats even started a whole YouTube series spectating bronze players, basically mocking people who claim to be “stuck in elo hell” who in reality just have an inflated ego, that’s preventing them from improving. They blame the game, their teammates, “Smurfs” and the matchmaking systems as a coping mechanism to not have to face the bitter truth: They are not better then everyone else without putting the work in.

I don’t post often on this sub and I don’t like being the one complaining, but I’ve been so frustrated with coming on here, looking for some discussions and news for my favorite game and every other post is some kid showing all of us how bad they are at the game and in the comments people usually just trash developers.

Overwatch 2 was an incredibly unsuccessful game and a wildly successful (though unethical) business move.,"There are so many posts asking up about shop prices and everything wrong with the game…

We all know why this is happening. Overwatch 1 came out nearly 8 years ago with very few players spending money on micro transaction and thus the game was bringing in very little money. 

So, how can blizzard squeeze more out of that dying game? Well why not rebrand the same game as “‘overwatch 2’”, change very little, and then flood it with micro transactions.      
- the new label will bring in THOUSANDS of players… thousands of customers.       
- take advantage of FOMO to boost sales for the new customers.     
- any money spent on the game is to be spent on making more money, not making a new game.
Realistically they’ve spent relatively little money on the game and have netted an absurd profit from new players and new sales. It’s a massive profit margin with little risk… hell the game was dying anyway.

Big win for blizzard.       
Massive L for players.

Let’s not pretend like we don’t why all the skins are as expansive as they are.       
Let’s not pretend we don’t know why the battle pass won’t pay for itself.       
Let’s not pretend we don’t know why bugs aren’t being fixed.        
Let’s not pretend we don’t know why it feels like the players aren’t heard.         

Let’s not pretend we don’t know why PvE was canceled, finally closing the curtains on the OW2 scheme.

That being said, OW at its core is a fun game. Feel free to enjoy the game, but know what blizzard is, what they stand for, and know how to separate your enjoyment of the game from your disdain with the company.",Overwatch,1692720608.0,t3_15yablm
Why do people care so much about the name?,"People talk about Wrecking Ball not being named Hammond as if it’s the presidential debate.

I'm disappointed in this community,"I woke up this morning, watched a kickass movie short based on my favourite video game, then spent half an hour reading complaint after complaint about it in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/99bwzk/overwatch_animated_short_shooting_star/).

&#x200B;

The most positive comments I saw said ""I liked it, but <four paragraphs of complaints>"".

&#x200B;

This community always comes up with amazing feedback, bug reports, balance suggestions, and other ideas. These conversations can be tough, but they're always about improving the game.

&#x200B;

Today, though, I saw something new: endless bashing of a work of art.

&#x200B;

That's the key thing: **these video shorts are art**. They don't affect gameplay. There's no ""right"" or ""wrong"". I think it's unbecoming of us to disregard the effort involved and explain how we could do it better.

Streamers aren't the only ones who got into the beta. Seriously.,"So there is a lot of anger on this subreddit right now. Some of it is just some good sarcastic fun, but a lot of it is genuine disgust. People are saying that this isn't a true 'random' beta that Blizzard advertised it to be.

**The majority of people that got invites were streamers!**

Where do you get that information? There has been absolutely no evidence for this. Think about it. If only streamers got in, who are they playing against? There are not nearly enough streamers to keep the servers running constantly. Streamers are obviously in the minority of people that got in.

**But the fact that a lot of popular streamers got in means that it isn't a truly random beta!**

I'm pretty sure Blizzard never said they were going to have a purely random beta. The fact that streamers got in first should really not be a surprise at all. Why give an invite to a random player when they can first give one to a streamer who will show the game to thousands? The game gets a lot more publicity, and perhaps more people will play it when the open beta comes out. And back to my previous point, most of the people playing are probably not streamers. There has been no evidence that these people have *not* been totally random selections.

**Since it isn't purely random, it isn't a traditional beta, it's a publicity ploy.**

If this beta was a publicity ploy, so what? A game always needs advertising. Just because it is advertising, doesn't mean it can't also be a traditional beta where players test out the game. Betas have always been somewhat selective, this is nothing new.

**But streamers won't even play the game for that long!**

How can you know this? The game might impress a streamer long enough to want him/her to keep playing for a long time. This would be good for the game. How can you be sure that a random player would play the game for longer than a streamer?

**But some streamers haven't even played fps's or team based games before, and so it isn't a true beta test!**

Getting people who have never played a similar game before is an excellent test, because it shows the perspective of how a totally new player views the game. Of course, getting experienced fps players is also important, which is why a lot of people in the beta are, in fact, experienced fps players.

**I've played Blizzard games for x years and signed up for the beta for y months, so I should get access.**

This sub was actively mocking this entitled belief not a few days ago. Blizzard doesn't owe you anything for being 'loyal'. If you think loyal fans of Blizzard should get priority, then you can't very well argue for a truly random beta, can you?

EDIT: **But I saw a lot of streamers playing each other/I and a lot of my friends all didn't get in!**

This is anecdotal evidence. This kind of evidence is bad because for every person claiming they and all their friends didn't get in or claiming they see a lot of streamers playing each other, there is another person claiming that they had a few of their friends get in, and not play against many streamers. Both sides that use this kind of evidence should be ignored.

I understand disappointment at not getting into the beta, but trying to get out some pitchforks over misconceived injustice is really pushing it. Think about it on the positive side: popular streamers are popular for a reason. Now you get to watch entertaining people play the game while you wait!",Overwatch,1446047301.0,t3_3qknuy
I really dislike the Overwatch community when it comes to comp,"So i went from plat to silver from trolls and was stuck in there for a month due to trolls and people refusing to work together.

Anyone i talked to about the problem came up with the same shit ""you belong there if you didn't you could solo carry the team and get out"" 

now i'm back where i belong but jesus that was a rough months i could only play at 2am and only people trolling or refusing to work as a team would play.

Somehow that is my fault and because i can't solo carry a silver team that can't function i don't belong in plat?

I really hate the attitude of the community and some of the beliefs people have just because you belong in a higher ranking and play best in a higher ranking doesn't instantly mean you will be able to solo carry a team of people who are working against you or are unable to get themselves functioning.

This is esspecialy true when no one wants to play healer in every game your in so your forced to mercy and lucio.

i have had over 20 people in the last month tell me i belong in a rank i don't and am not in anymore for a good reason and honestly i think this whole ""if you are good you can solo carry"" attitude is just toxic and incredibly incorrect.

Just wanted to put my thoughts out there as this is the only competitive community where i have heard such bullshit.",Overwatch,1493977094.0,t3_69dp6a
"Hot take: Brigitte is fine, the community just hasn't had time to adjust to her yet.","Seriously, she's only been in competitive for 4 days and the witch hunt to get her nerfed is in full force. Maybe give it a couple weeks for people to learn how to counter her before deciding if nerfs are needed... Too late now I guess, Blizzard is already caving in. 

Blizzard finally gives us supports that are fun to play (Moira and Brigitte), and people immediately cry for nerfs on both of them upon release into competitive. Thankfully they left Moira alone, and people eventually got used to her.",Overwatch,1525440221.0,t3_8gz7g6
The Genji Nerfs are reasonable. Hold on to your body pillows.,"Blizzard does this. They fully commit to one direction with buffs/nerfs then reel it back to the Goldilocks point that is generally quite balanced. For instance Zenyatta's health buff plus orb buffs were too much, so they nerfed the Discord Orb a bit. D.Va's defense matrix was too spammable after the huge buff so they nerfed the cooldown a bit.

This strategy inherently takes *time* to work. In order to balance a competitive game like OW you need to experiment with changes. I'm already tired of Genji weaboos whining that he seems ""unusable"" now. Genji players have had it made these past few months with how amazingly strong he is. It makes sense to me that such a dominant character gets a substantial yet reasonable nerf. He's hardly ""nerfed to the ground"" as I have seen repeated in many a comment section today. For one:

- Dashing through traps was always dumb, if you travel within it's area of effect you should be affected by it (hello). You don't see Reinhardts complaining about their rocket propelled metal hulk suit getting stopped by traps do you?

- Double jump resetting after a wall climb never made sense. period. 

Edit: By this I meant that it doesn't make sense that he got a *third* jump if he jumped twice before a wall climb, not that the concept of double jumping doesn't make sense lol

- They closed a loophole in animation canceling that was never intended nor made sense

Time will tell if Dragonblade was nerfed too much, good the way it is now, or whatever. But as somebody who always picks support or tank when it's needed (and guess what it's needed 90% of the time because of people autolocking a certain aforementioned hero), I really have no sympathy for Genji mains right now. ~~#sorrynotsorry #shrugemoji~~",Overwatch,1471483990.0,t3_4y9i4j

The Pros and Cons of Locking Heroes behind the Battle-Pass. I'll go First.,"Pros:

* &#x200B;
* &#x200B;
* &#x200B;
* &#x200B;

Cons:

* It Delays the Access of New Meaningful Content to Players, which will Hinder Player Numbers.
* It's Justified as being a ""Main Draw of the Battle-Pass"", which is an Excuse for Blizzard to Skimp in Every Other Aspect.
* It gives the Buyer an Unfair Advantage either through having an Extra - Potentially Over-Tuned - Hero in Quick Play, or more Playtime and Practice for Competitive.
* Heroes are Designed to be ""on the Safe Side of Strong"", which can make them a Must-Pick when Balance goes Wrong, which is a Problem that's Accentuated by the Price-Tag.
* There is no other way to Earn the Hero, without either Forcing a Grind with a Potential Disadvantage, Forcing you to Spread your Wallet, or Forcing you to Play Certain Arcade Game-Modes where they are Playable by Default, i.e. Mystery Heroes.
* The New Hero could have an Ability or Kit that is Essential for Countering another Dominant Hero.
* It Alienates New or Returning Players by Artificially Limiting their Hero Selection.

This game just doesn’t feel the same anymore and I’m sad.,"Why go 5v5?

I think the removal of the second tank is going to be looked back at in the future as what killed OW for good. I love the game but it’s not the same anymore. They pretty much removed an entire role from the game. I can never have the same experience, that made me fall in love with the game ever again. Off-tank, in my opinion, was the best/most fun role. On top of that it also enabled so many other scenarios, who’s peeling for the supports now? The other healer? The DPS? Good luck in lower ELOs! The tank? Good luck in lower ELOs, even if you peel in plat or below… everyone else will stay full throttle.

They punted the roles of Tank and Support expecting it to save the game but gave the majority of the player base a worse experience to appease the DPS mains. 

I miss bubbling a rein. I miss initiating a dive with a slam and a bubble from a Zarya. Why simplify a game that had so much complexity.

No more number goes up and goes down? Why even play comp? I could play for hours and finish at the same ELO solely off of watching the number fluctuate. Losing felt punishing and winning felt rewarding. Now the game feels like nothing matters and you get rewarded or fucked for absolutely zero reason. By the time my rank changes I don’t even remember the first game in the cycle. 

This company fucking blows. They had a scandal and in order to save face and distract people they raped their own game. What a fitting end to a game made by a company that’s greedy beyond belief and covers up SA.

Y’all cried and made Blizzard ruin the game just for queue times to go back to where they were a year ago. This is the only multiplayer game I’ve played for
the past 6 years. I haven’t played in weeks. I used to play every night. RIP.

We Need To Fix I Need Healing.,"As someone who plays healer a lot and tries to heal people when they say I need healing we need to change some things.

1. You should not be able to say I need healing when your dead. I saw someone suggest that when your dead I need healing changes to I will respawn in _ seconds. This is much more useful and wouldn't make healers worry about dead people.

2. You should not be able to say I need healing when you are at full health. You could take this even further and make it so you can't say I need healing unless you missing 10 or more health.

3. You should not be able to say I need healing when you are being healed. You could change this so that it says I am at full health I'm sure it could be useful in some situations.

"Hold Blizzard to higher standards, please","Why is it that in every complaint thread I see about the new Olympic Lootboxes the Reddit Defense Force has to come in and start throwing around names like ""entitled"" and ""ungrateful"", all the while falling back on the argument that ""well other games would be making you pay the actual maps and characters""

Are you kidding me? 

It doesn't matter what other companies do, it's a shitty practice regardless of who does what. I don't come into your house and tell you I can steal your stuff because some other guy stole 4x as much last year, and call you a bitch when you question my logic. 

I understand, Blizzard REALLY needs cash, they're struggling to get by since all their games end up being huge flops that never hold world record playerbases or top viewcounts on Twitch, so I forgive them, they can make us pay for cosmetics, but for the love of god don't remove the ability to buy the skins with ingame currency. There's no excuse for this.

I understand some players have more money than time, and just want to buy some lootboxes rather than grind them out, that's ok. But at least the players with time were able to use surplus skins to get one they were missing. This whole skin update favors players with money far more than those with time (especially because it's a limited time event), and while you can grind out the lootboxes from levels, that's not a matter of time, it's a matter of RNG. 

So just STOP comparing Overwatch to f2p MOBAs, this is a premium game by an incredibly successful company. Blizzard can do better.",Overwatch,1470165821.0,t3_4vuaao
Anyone else getting tired of everyone complaining about the summer games event?,"SO MUCH COMPLAINING about the summer games.
[It seems like no one even KNOWS about the video made by Jeff giving some insight on their approach on seasonal events.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLQPx78ntYM) Main points were:    
- This is an experiment with a lot of room for improvement    
- They want the items to feel extra special and don't want everyone to go around with every summer games item
>**MAKE LIMITED TIME BOXES HAVE NO DUPLICATES**   
    
Making boxes have no duplicates seems like an overkill. The game has been only out for a little over 3 months and I think blizzard wants you to collect **FREE** stuff over the course of a long-ass time. They *want* people to buy and open boxes for the joy of gambling and the ""unboxing"" experience.    
Making boxes have no duplicates goes against this, and will result in every wanker owning every summer games item, given that you're secured 1 summer games item per box.    
> **I ONLY WANTED X SKIN BUT I GOT EVERYTHING ELSE**    
    
I think this is a sign of the event being too long to fit blizzard's intent of making the skins rare. The other reason is probably that there are too little skins in the game overall, and for some characters there are not enough good skins (cough tracer) to compensate for releasing limited skins. that aren't garbage.    
    
**SUMMARY**    
This was the very first event in the history of the game and was overall a big experiment for the Overwatch team. Sure the execution was fairly poor but again; first event, experimenting etc. In the other hand almost nobody has touched on the fact that we had only 1 brawl (lucio ball) for 3 fucken weeks.   
Getting driven away now so let loose and realize that this is a very new game and Trust Blizzard in taking some good damn notes and make future events better. Thanks for reading.

How Overwatch Characters Eat Their Food,,Overwatch,1505395622.0,t3_7027ey
Tanks are more fun than OW1,"I hear the opposite quite a lot, and I think the opinions are valid, but I can never relate. OW2 has one of my favorite tank experiances across any other game. So I thought I might share my perspective to maybe inspire some people to pick up the role, or at least look at it differently. 

I love playing tank in every game in general because they look the coolest, they're on the front line taking on everything for the glory of the team's success, and they always feel the most powerful. I don't need another tank to steal all the glory. If you think that's too much pressure then that's fine if it's not for you, but some believe the role is wrong and should be changed. I SAY NAY!

OW2 tanks all recieved buffs to help and it's never felt better playing Rein with more health & shield HP, or Zarya who can now self bubble, and not to mention wrecking ball which is the most fun tank to play imo with the amount of skill expression. 

**Common tank complaints I hear:**

1.  **""Bastion is no fun to play against. He keeps shredding my shield""** Have you tired simply not holding your shield to him and instead hiding behind the wall? Bastion is the easiest pick of my life once he's out of his turrent form. If he's able to get into a good flank that doesn't allow you to take cover, then take some responsability for letting that happen. Play faster and wreck the rest of the team better next time. Make his team flame him for taking such long flanks and abondoning his team for kills
2. **""Zen discord makes tanking unplayable""** Not unplayable, just challenging, which I welcome. You have to remember that they have less heals in favor of more damage now. So I like to play wrecking ball into zen. I won't win against a 1v1 against a cracked zen (a bad or even an average zen is an easy pick though for wrecking ball), but I kill zen's other healer & other DPS easier because zen can't heal them fast enough. The window of opportunity is smaller, but that just makes it cooler in my eyes when I succeed.
3. **""My team needs me to switch heros to counter the enemy""** You sort of have to do that in every role anyways, that's part of the game, but some people don't realize that you don't have to counter everyone all the time. I'm diamond tank, but I'm also silver support. I won't tell my support to switch because that's not a role I understand enough; however I noticed that most people who tell me to switch tend to be low rank on their tank role. I won't dismiss the switch request right away, but you need to decide for yourself if switching is really the right play or not.  Most of the time it's not, and your team is just scared because they don't have a shield holding their hand all the time. 
4. **""It's always Tank diff. So much flame, so much pressure, etc""** In my eyes Overwatch is hands down the most toxic community I ever seen across all games I ever played; and that includes old school halo & call of duty lobbies. You need to be a tank irl and not let it get to you. At least in the Halo & CoD lobbies they were edgy to be funny, but OW community is special because they are not trying to be edgy, racist, or homophic (most of the time). So many people believe they know everything about the game and have the right to tell you exactly how to play and if you don't listen to them you LEGIT get reported for throwing the game, which is so wild to me. I hear this less the more I rank up, but I can't believe I was hearing this in bronze. Like, ok buddy, don't try to pretend you know what you're saying when you're stuck in bronze with me. Just shut up and prove you're better than me by ranking up. I did. 
5. **""Switch off Ball or you're throwing""** I hear this often before the match even starts. I know diamond isn't the highest rank, but at least give me a tiny bit of respect. You really think I'm in the rank because I'm picking characters that don't work?
6. **""Phara & mercy hard""** Make them think that about you. Make their life miserable. Pharmercy's are usually always spoiled thinking they are feared by everyone, especially the mercy. Everytime I go winston or wrecking ball, I can pick off their mercy pretty easily, but I have a feeling this won't work in higher ranks. Sometimes I just have to trust the team and I will tank for them to get the space they need to succeed. The phara+mercy are only 2 people afterall, and there's still 3 other enemies ready to kill!

It’s sad to see so much external hate for such a well made game.,"There’s already a good amount of skepticism here about OW2, but I think this is a great time for overwatch fans.

Every other gaming sub shits on this game on the daily. They don’t even know this will be free to play, and flames the game for every aspect it does even when a large majority of the community wanted it. 

The community wanted a way for new players to slowly learn and not clog up ranked, blizzard delivered 

The community wanted less toxic idiots in chat and blizzard delivered 

The community wanted to finally get rid of smurfs and blizzard somehow also delivered. 

But every one of these changes has made those outside of this sub enraged for some reason. 

OW2 might have growing pains, and hopefully they lean closer to fortnite passes and less Halo infinite greed, but the game itself has honestly been the best shooter ever made.

PSA:Stop spreading misinformation,"Blizzard is most likely not going to charge for heroes past the first 21, and they have stated that they want everyone to have access to every hero. It is an advertisement for a product, and of course they are going to fucking announce the amount of player characters available on launch.

There will be skins
There might be different hero color schemes available
Blizzard does not want to charge for heroes and that is not their plan

The change Sombra really needs: Interupting Hack should put it on cooldown,"Hey all. I'll try to keep this one short. Sombra's hack is a pretty divisive issue at the moment, as the hero obviously needed some help but the buffs have invested her utility more heavily into her least-fun ability. Nerfing her at this point could remove her from viability completely, as her inability to farm EMP removes most of the only previous utility she had, on defence on maps like Volskaya and Anubis.

Rather than revert her entirely or nerf her into the ground, I think that making her hack an all-or-nothing ability makes the most sense for a few reasons:

1) **This is how abilities in the game are designed to function.** When ultimates were adjusted so that pressing Q instantly drained all ult charge, it was explained (IIRC) that they were meant to function in an all-or-nothing manner. Sombra's hack currently works in such a way that you can attempt it over and over until it succeeds. This means that your outplay potential against Sombra is limited and your ability to punish poorly-timed hacks is miniscule.

2) It would not reduce Sombra's utility, or really even her viability, but would increase her skill ceiling while making her hack feel less unfair to play against.

3) It would put her more in line with other timing and engagement-based DPS heroes, such as Genji and Tracer. As it is, there really isn't enough of a downside to having a hack interrupted. Sombra's playstyle seems inherently designed around proper timing, but her abilities are all pretty forgiving of poor play.

**tl;dr by forcing Sombra's hack onto cooldown once it's interrupted, she becomes less unfair to play against without diminishing her role in the game and threatening her overall viability**

This seems like a pretty reasonable and efficient change to her anti-fun aspects without running the risk of nerfing her into the ground.

[Serious] PTR Sombra: Why we have these changes.,"Blizzard's philosophy is to make every character unique in design, gameplay, and personality. No two characters in Overwatch are alike. So when changes have to be made to character's abilities, the Overwatch Team keeps the theme of the character in mind.

Since her release, Jeff Kaplan has been adamant about Sombra's role as a disruptor in Overwatch.

>*""One area, where we might not see eye-to-eye on with the player-base, is we don't expect Sombra to ever be a vicious assassin. [...] We see her more as a disruptor—a back-line disruptor—than a front-line flanker or assassin.""*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ndash; Jeff Kaplan, [Developer Update - January 17th, 2017](https://youtu.be/ibPLyx8QWYc?t=7m9s)

The current changes on the PTR reflect the ideology of Sombra as a disruptor&mdash;an infiltrator who takes opportunities and distracts the enemy team while giving information to her teammates. However, many Sombra players are skeptical of the changes and believe that it will only hurt her more.

To address these concerns, we should identify the problems with Sombra's current kit as she tries to execute the role of disruptor. If you are unfamiliar with Sombra's abilities, you can read about them [here](http://overwatch.wikia.com/wiki/Sombra).


&nbsp;

## It's not about Hack
In a perfect world where bugs don't exist, Hack is a strong ability. It stops enemy abilities mid-cast and prevents other abilities from being used for 6 seconds. Being Hacked *feels* like an eternity of helplessness.

In the past, the Overwatch Team has tried making changes to Hack that fortifies Sombra's role as a disruptor. Changes we have seen are:

> - Cooldown reduced from 12 seconds to 8 seconds &ndash; (Jan 12, 2017)
> - Cast time reduced from 1 second to 0.8 seconds &ndash; (Jan 12, 2017)
> - Cast time further reduced from 0.8 seconds to 0.65 seconds &ndash; (Feb 27, 2018)
> - Hack disables more abilities, most of which are movement related &ndash; (Feb 27, 2018)

Hack's cast time was buffed to allow Sombra to more consistently cast it within the short time she was present in an engagement. However, this didn't provide counterplay for the enemy as Sombra could teleport away shortly after Hacking a target.

> - Now goes on a 2-second cooldown when interrupted by damage &ndash; (Mar 20, 2018)
> - Now more consistently interrupted when targets break line of sight &ndash; (Mar 20, 2018)

The 2 second cooldown nerf to Hack allows enemies a chance to fight Sombra and encourages her to think through and position before her engagements.

But Sombra has a problem&mdash;consistency. Not with casting Hack, (although we know there have been bug issues in the past, but that's another post), but with consistently providing pressure and being present in fights. Sombra's inconsistent presence in fights results in fewer opportunities for her to cast Hack and disrupt the enemy. 

&nbsp;

## It's about Mobility and Consistency

The Overwatch Team's goal is have Sombra fill the role of a disruptor. Sombra is intended to be a character that lurks close to the enemy team, disrupts / startles enemies with Hack, takes advantage of poor positioning, and punishes enemies for having low HP. However, Sombra's current kit does not permit her to do these things **consistently**. 


## The Bungee Effect

Translocator can be used to aggressively reposition in a fight, however most Sombras will use Translocator defensively by setting it at a safe location, usually on a health pack. She'll run out in Stealth, position behind a target, attempt to kill or hack them, then teleport back with Translocate whether her mission was successful or not. In some cases, Sombra has to travel a great distance to get to a fight&mdash;only to Translocate away and be very far from the action again.

Worst case scenario, Sombra isn't in a position capitalize on enemy mistakes and she needs to blow cooldowns in order to reach a favorable position again.

As a result, Sombra engages an enemy with Translocator placed, Stealth on cooldown, and only Hack available (which goes on a 2 second cooldown if she take 0.1 damage), leaving her only option to Translocate away&mdash;this is the **Bungee Effect**. Sombra spends so much time traveling back-and-forth that she lacks a consistent presence in teamfights.

Forcing Sombra to teleport away in the middle of a fight is incredibly valuable to the enemy team and gives them the advantage to fight 6v5. And, to be clear, this should be valuable to the enemy team. It provides counterplay and requires meaningful decision making by the Sombra player. However, in her **pre-PTR** state, the **Bungee Effect** directly leads to her inconsistency to provide pressure and fulfill the roles of an infiltrator and disruptor that the Overwatch Team wants for her.

&nbsp;

## What the PTR changes are

In the past, the Overwatch Team has tried making changes to Hack that fortifies Sombra's role as a disruptor. However, none of those changes really addressed the **Bungee Effect**. Sombra was still spending more time and resources getting to a position to cast Hack than she was able to take advantage of landing one. 

Let's talk about the changes to Sombra's kit on the PTR and how they directly reflect the Overwatch Team's vision of her as a back-line disruptor:

> **Sombra** &ndash; [PTR - Jun 28, 2018](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/overwatch-ptr-patch-notes-june-28-2018/142126/3)

> - Stealth

  >   - Now lasts indefinitely

  >   - No longer can contest objectives while invisible

  >   - Enemy detection radius increased from 2 meters to 4 meters

  >   - Movement speed buff decreased from +75% to +50%

> - Translocator

  >   - Now lasts indefinitely

  >   - Can now be destroyed (has 5 health) *after being deployed on the ground* ^*

  >   - *Can now be recalled (canceled) by Sombra (2 second cooldown)* ^*

>

> **Developer Comments**: *These changes allow Sombra to more easily play as an infiltrator and scout for her team, as well as give her time to pick and choose when to reveal herself to ambush her enemies.*

^* *Not mentioned in PTR patch notes*

These changes reverse the roles of Stealth and Translocator, with the aim to bring consistency to Sombra's role as a disruptor. 

#### Stealth

Stealth has been used as the primary tool to reposition and travel, thus the drop to +50% bonus movement speed appears unfavorable to many players. Stealth is no longer an offensive tool used to get behind the enemy *as quickly*.

However, Stealth now has an infinite duration allowing Sombra to lurk around the enemy team and take advange of opportunities as they unfold. Sombra has more freedom with her movement on the PTR. She can now use Stealth in conjunction with Translocator to quickly access flank paths and freely position behind the enemy without being on a 6 second timer. 

While Stealth is not as aggressive of a repositioning tool as it's pre-PTR counterpart (move speed now 50% from 75%), it has become a protective shroud that keeps Sombra safe and unnoticed as long as she stays within it. Sombra can now exert her presence more consistently and for a longer duration than she ever could before.

#### Translocator

In the **Bungee Effect**, Translocator has primarly been used as a ""get-out-of-jail-free"" ability allowing Sombra to escape death by the skin of her teeth. 

With the PTR changes, Translocator can now be ""recalled"" by Sombra using the interact key (F). It's put on short 2 second cooldown, and allows Sombra to advance her base of operations by setting it in a new location with the safety provided by Stealth.

Translocator having the ability to be destroyed now means it should be placed thoughtfully in locations that are difficult for other characters to access. Translocator should no longer be carelessly placed on a Hacked health pack as it is too easily discovered, and should now be hidden from plain sight. 

Translocator has a 4 second cooldown, 2 seconds shorter than Stealth, and can be reliably used in combat as an aggressive repositioning tool as it is indestructible while flying through the air.

&nbsp;

## Conclusion

The aim of the PTR changes is to clean up the **Bungee Effect** and provide consistency to Sombra's role as a Disruptor and Infiltrator. 
- She now has more consistent presence in fights. 
- She can pick and choose her engagements more freely. 
- Stealth now enables Sombra to wait for the right moment and protects her from harm.
- Translocator can still serve as a safety net when placed intelligently, but can now be used to aggressively re-position within the safety of Stealth as well as during fights. 
- Sombra should spend less time running to a fight and more time being present in it.

These changes may require a change in playstyle, but it's well worth it to provide consistency to Sombra's presence on the battlefield. It won't make Sombra kill anyone faster, but she was never intended to do that in the first place. If players can understand the role Sombra was intended to fill as a Disruptor, I think they will better understand and appreciate these changes.

### TL:DR;

**Sombra is a Disruptor.** *Not an Assassin.*

The PTR changes help Sombra accomplish her role as in Disruptor more consistently.

- Infinite Stealth makes it easier for Sombra to be in proximity of the enemy team and be present in fights.

- Translocator can now be canceled, allowing Sombra to advance her position into enemy territory.

- Translocator is now a permanent safety net as long as Sombra places it out of reach of the enemy.

Pharah-mercy is unfair and overpowered,"I know this is controversial and I'm automatically a ""skillless noob"" for saying it but lets talk about it.

First of all, im not talking about grandmaster or top 500 pharah-mercy, (although it's still overpowered even there, how else would yznsa get all the top 10s at the same time for the first time in ow history with pharah-mercy compo, and win without any lose in the world cup) but I'm talking about plat and below, the skill it takes to play pharah mercy is NOWHERE near the skill it takes to play against them, pharah's damage (especially boosted) can out damage any heal, while the hitscans damage can only out damage mercy's heal with headshots, and they can't headshot her in low ranks because their aim isn't the best, I don't blame them tho, a flying cannon with ridiculous damage that can two shot you with barely any accurate aim required isn't an easy target, and since I main support I need help from the dps to take them down, weird how it's a team's job talking only two of the enemy's team, and people still say she's balanced, I keep giving my team plans but they ignore it, I tell the to focus the other healer, kill mercy frist, play echo mercy, they just ignore me and we lose, even if I land headshots and kill one of them I still need help from the dps, and this is where the problem is.

Most dps if not all in plat and below aren't good at aiming, I see them take hitscan but can't land consistent shots, I just played a game where we had extra 4 min from the first round, the payload never stopped, yet the second they started playing pharah mercy we immediately lost every push, and you don't even have time to kill her, about 5 second until she notices you and kill you with three or two rockets, I tried literally everything with my dps, I played mercy and boost them but it didn't work, so I play ana and focus mercy but she keeps hiding so I try to kill pharah instead, can't out damage mercy's heal so I change, I tried baptiste but I still can't out damage the heal she gets, and it's hard landing headshots while she moves and shoot me and I have to keep moving too and avoid the shots, illari was kinda good against her but still didn't work out since the whole team is helping pharah, while my dps playing ashe from VERY far away where her damage only deals about 50 if not less, and widow with really bad aim, it's just impossible ranking up with teams like this, I literally just about now gave the nano to the tank and he kept shooting our ashe instead of the enemy!. 

I even tried the compo with a friend and we won 3 times in a row!! in low ranks literally no one is competent against her, I know the key is just to learn how to aim but again, in that rank barely anyone has good aim, none of the dps I play with can play against that compo, especially because taking them down requires REALLY good aim, pocket, and sometimes even double heal and shield.

It's just REALLY frustrating and unfair playing against them, I keep avoiding her rockets, healing my dps and tank, killing mercy every now and then, and my dps literally do nothing!, you might think I'm exaggerating about my dps so here you go, didn't even have to look deep, it's from my last match

Junkrat's Skill Ceiling is higher than you think,"People always assume that heroes that are easy to pick up have low skill ceilings. And while I understand Junkrat is fairly easy to pick up and play he also has insane potential when played at his peak.

Let's start with his primary fire. We all know you can just spam grenades down chokepoints to get value, since it makes it more difficult for teams to push through. However his primary is likely the highest skill ability at Junkrat's disposal. Junkrat's bounces are hard to predict as the slightest change in aim and angle can completely change where the grenade ends up. But the bounces are consistent, they will always go the same path if they are shot the same way. Giving him much room to be dynamic, learning different angles and bounces to hit people without even exposing yourself at times. Junkrat's biggest strength is being able to hit enemies from so many different directions without needing to be in LOS of the enemy. Combine this with good game sense and you have an enemy that can hail mary grenades down any path you're likely to take. Punishing your every movement, and hitting you in positions you would typically find safe.

His projectile isn't easy to aim either. I remember when I first started out playing JR I constantly felt like I needed to over compensate my flicks simply cause the projectile moves so slow compared to how fast most heroes are in Overwatch. And tracking is simply not viable for Junkrat aim, as with how fast people can move and change direction you're doomed to fail if you try to track someone while positioning your crosshair so far ahead of them. Not to mention trying to hit air shots, which are one of the most challenging and satisfying things to hit in the game imo. Another thing to note is Junkrat's slow projectile is not only a weakness but a strength as well. As it allows Junkrat to bounce his grenades to hit a target near simultaneously, bursting down low health targets and severely crippling tanks. Things like this are why Junkrat has the highest burst potential in the game, he may not have the highest burst damage ability (as D.va bomb holds that title) but in terms of applying high burst damage in a short amount of time he is unbeatable.

Now onto his trap, this ability probably has the least variation out of Junkrat's kit but it still is a lot more useful than you may think first glance. Junkrat's trap is used as a minor zone control tool, it can alert you of flankers, either by them being caught or them destroying it which alerts you. Or it can be used to delay or create space in 1v1s or in chokepoints. When you're in a 1v1 you can throw out your trap in front of you which typically does 2 things. 1, the enemy shoots the trap buying you a second or two to back up and shoot them, or 2, they go around and avoid it and you can use that space you've created to make you hard to approach. Sometimes enemies can walk into the trap by accident if they're not paying attention when you do this. You can also throw your trap around corners to attract turret fire so you can easily shoot them while they attack the trap. Overall a basic ability, but still very useful depending on how you use it.

His mine is one of the most versatile abilties in the game, as it's a powerful mobility ability and a good method to kill confirm. One little trick is if you press jump and immediately detonate the mine you can go much higher than you would detonating normally. You can combo the mine with your primary so they hit a target near simultaneously for an insta kill at close to mid range. And while the mine does have a fairly big AOE, it takes decent aim and prediction to use it past close range. It also is good for creating space not only for yourself but for your team by knocking away divers attacking you and your backline. This is Junkrat's most consistent damage ability and the falloff nerf being as severe as this is could severely ruin that. Turning him potentially less consistent than before the buff, so I do hope they look at either lessening the fall off. Removing the falloff and nerfing the damage to 90, or reducing the AOE slightly instead.

And finally you have the riptire, which is Junkrat's riskiest ability as he leaves his body completely defenseless while he uses it. The tire is best used for single picks as it's relatively fast to get and very easy to shutdown if used recklessly. Going for extra kills should normally be either a bonus to your original pick, or only during very oppurtune moments. The tire is also great for zoning the enemy, as you can simply drive it in to a wall and have enemies afraid to push forward cause of the constant threat the tire poses. This is a good way to stall for time while a teammate is respawning, or as a way to throw people off before going in for a kill. It's wall climb gives it much room for creativity since it can go over buildings to hit targets like Pharah, or to simply be unpredictable. The tire is also a fantastic bait ability, if you turn a corner and pull a riptire when you know the enemy has a Genji or Tracer near by. Don't be afraid to hold it against the wall for a second to kill the flanker trying to jump you. Easy way to get yourself an initial pick for your team to push on. You can also camp the body from there to zone the enemy Mercy from rezzing your kill.

And just as a mention the death bombs Junkrat drops from his passive are very limited in use. The main use you can get out of this is by jumping onto shield generators, teleporters, or setup Bastions, as killing you means the the target your on top of will be destroyed in the process.

Overall I just wanted to give people an idea of what Junkrat's truly capable of beyond his spammy nature.

Unpopular Opinion: Mercy isn't the problem,"So many people this season are whining about Mercy and how everyone plays her and get unfair inflated SR, and ""Mercy main btw"" has turned into the new ""Hanzo main"" insult. I understand people are upset that a hero that requires less mechanical FPS skill can be as useful (or more so) than more mechanically difficult characters but that isn't reason to hate people for enjoying a character.


The problem isn't Mercy, it's one tricks.


Overwatch is a team based shooter that's main feature is being able to switch heroes to counter and adapt to the enemy and the situations presented. ANYONE who is a one trick is detrimental to the game. Heaven forbid your one trick has their character taken at the start of a match. The worst outcome there is they throw because they're upset about it, or they try to play something else but aren't skilled enough at anything except their one trick main and therefore under perform for the skill level they're at. Sure it's true some one tricks do better at other heroes if they already play a character more mechanically difficult, but the problem isn't JUST Mercy.


It's a shame these people exist, and it's shame they can't branch out to play other characters. I've just gotten really tired of this weird double standard and circle jerk. I love playing supports- all of them fairly equally. For as much as people hate others for playing Mercy I'll often go into a comp game and pick Zen or Lucio, only to have my team -want- a Mercy. I don't have issues playing Mercy, but then someone will look at this season in comp I've been playing her a lot and start screeching about Mercy mains. I know the correct way to deal with these toxic folks is to ignore them, but good lord when a game only has four healers it's frustrating when you don't want to play one at all because of how people treat you when you do.


I guess just be good to each other, no matter what you play. One tricks suck and ruin the whole point of the game, as any hero.",Overwatch,1498298503.0,t3_6j7eko

Unpopular opinion: Amount of hate for GOATS is very extreme and uneccessary.,"I have been browsing this sub as well as r/Competitiveoverwatch in wait for the new hero Baptise. As I have been looking through all the posts I have noticed a significant amount of hate towards the goats comp and how the new hero could fix the problems. Yes, I understand goats has been the meta for 3 - 4 seasons now and has been the center of discussion for a while now BUT, If you have ever played competitive overwatch ever, goats is only really ever played in gm+ consitently. As much as I would love to believe that all 100k + people in the owl chat are in gm and spamming goats ResidentSleeper, it is just not true and many people have barely even watched yet played goats. So please, goats is a problem but it is only a problem in gm+ which is not the majority of the player base which is why blizzard has been slow to act on this ""problem.""

I already know this is gonna get a ton of down votes because everyone just follows the bandwagon but keep this in mind when Baptise comes out and may or may not change the meta.",Overwatch,1551202745.0,t3_av25p1

If people want Brigitte Nerfed then Tracer will continue to suffocate the game (like she did for almost 2 years),"Your Overwatch now done  a 'concerned' video about Brigitte. Sure others will follow and it will continue onwards all the complaints. 

**Whenever I get mad at Brigitte I then come across a Tracer God and welcome Brigitte.  People say how Brigitte suffocates the game -- Tracer did that for pretty much 2 years. A God Tracer or a Tracer that knows what they doing can completely end a game and utterly remove all fun for everyone else. Tracer literally makes a vast majority of the cast obsolete. Which in many ways is what Brigitte does sure but in reverse and actually including tracer.**  

Brigitte Stun killing a tracer is hardly a McCree flash-hammer tank to death. Tracer gets deleted and so can a Genji. Neither of their deaths or eliminations is different to a Flash and Fan the Hammer. That fast deleting can literally save a team fight which you otherwise were pretty much doomed to die in with a Genji and Tracer (along with their low health). You smash to death a Genji Dragonblader or a Tracer dancing over your team you literally can save your team, teamfight and match and turn the tides of a game. 

Her shield bash is to make you not want to fight her in close quarters like a reaper and work as a survival means against swamping. Any notion of aim though is silly-- whipshot is aimshot but Brigitte is Melee hero so aim is irrelevant in discussing her. That be like complaining about Reinhardt swinging his hammer. You being terrified to fight in CQC is what Brigitte was designed to do but once you remove the fear or acknowledge that battling with her she will slap you. You and your team can start the battling. Though the problem is vast majority of people are too lazy to six stack or work as team, just want to frag and  solo q means you will play with random players. Then every game due to randomness means will never foster synergy of teamwork. You will never get to know each other which leads to tactics and countering along with organization which defeats Brigitte.  Failure of teamwork and disorganized play will likely happen more often then not even in highest tiers with Solo Q which is what Brigitte devours. 

Sombra btw works great against Brigitte with team work. So start playing more Sombra who also can counter  Hanzo and Zarya a fair bit (Sombra also can counter Pharah more reliably if you get the hack). 

**Blizzard aint empty of blame** because part of the issues in Overwatch now about heroes is due to Blizzard fault. By them making, by designing, heroes destined to be useless against other heroes or be greatly at a disadvantage along with their refusal for universal balance. Then due to us not having more heroes currently that can open up games means weaken team comp capabilities. Though comps that counter Brigitte exist. 

**The whole philosophy of blizz to make some heroes designed to lose and some designed to be always the apex against others is the problem with Overwatch (nothing shown better by the stagnation of Dive that lasted over a year at minimum)**

**So for Solo Q you either *Nerf Tracer* or *Nerf Brigitte. Then you need to buff all the heroes, especially those made useless by Tracer, to be able to counter tracer**.  

In the meantime you get Brigitte but Blizzard may minimal tweak Brigitte and just leave it to players to get better at dealing with her.",Overwatch,1527382661.0,t3_8mehju
As a Hanzo main with 120+ hours. The new PTR changes on Hanzo feel clunky. I want to talk about it and suggestions. (PTR Feedback),"Ok. The Hanzo changes are on PTR right now, available for everyone on PC. I tried the hanzo changes and really quick it felt really clunky to me. They introduced a Leap that activates when youre midair and click your jump button with a 4sec cooldown. Stormbow arrow travel speed is faster now, Sonic arrow radius, timer, cooldown changed and the new ability where u shoot 6 fast arrows (which is not a one-hit kill on the head btw).

Ok i have 2 problems and those are the Leap and the new rapid arrows ability. 

* 1: When you jump down a wall, and you release your jump key afterwards, you sometimes want to climb back on the wall because you've changed your mind, this is still possible BUT because you've released your jump key and have to click/hold the button again to wallclimb it will activate the Leap which is a big waste. 

What i suggest to change is, to activate the leap you have to double click on the jump button when Midair, no more accidently leaps when you just wanted to wallclimb.

* 2: Hanzo's rapid arrows ability is also very clunky because when you activate the ability you're in a seperate shooting state where you cant get out. you either have to wait untill the timer runs out or when your 6 arrows are fired. 

I suggest if you click on the ability again it will cancel it, just like Sonic arrow and previously Scatter arrow. Depending on the amount of arrows you had left while in the rapid arrow ability, the shorter the cooldown will be when you cancel it.
So more arrows left means shorter cooldown when you canceled it.",Overwatch,1524229294.0,t3_8dndm6
Unpopular Opinion - I am perfectly fine with the loot box drop rate/currency system. It makes items more special and rare.,"With the amount of complaining about loot boxes on this thread lately, I thought I would put in my 2¢. Events are supposed to be a special occurrence and believe it or not, you are not supposed to get everything.  The fact that you can even get cosmetic items for free just by playing is more than kind of Blizzard when you look at other games.  

What makes event items so special is the rarity of them and I would hate for that to be taken away. It feels so good to get a new legendary event skin and if they made the drop rate more common that feeling would shrink drastically and it would be just as mundane as opening normal loot boxes.

Blizzard has put out an amazing game for $40. No paid DLC bullshit, no pay 2 win. All in-game content is free.  That being said, Blizzard is a business they need to make money to continue development for OW somehow, and they achieve this through loot boxes. 

tl;dr. Events are special, you are not supposed to be able to unlock everything.  This is there way of making money as opposed to paid dlc or other in-game content.",Overwatch,1497361731.0,t3_6gzyzp
"If we don't get outraged over this box, Halloween and Xmas ones will come next.

Not give them a free pass and calm down after the initial two days.

**Edit**: Wow, I can't believe this is such a torn subject, seems like over 50% of people are totally ok with this practise.

To recap: I'm not angry they are using a different lootbox for the drops, I'm angry they won't allow us to purchase the skins with coins. This makes all the skins we've held off on buying with the hopes of buying some new ones might be thrown out the window.

If you guys are totally ok with us not being able to buy holiday skins then don't complain. But this is a huge nono in my eyes.",Overwatch,1470177798.0,t3_4vvb3i
Can we stop trying to adjust the game for competitive play and get bliz to do things for competitive play?,"Seriously the game is not even released and more than 30% of the visitors here plan to be professional players, that's player earning his living from the game for those who dont know.

Lucio's new wallride cuts the BS out of his kit,"Wallriding on the live server requires tons of skill and practice to master. This sounds like a good thing, but in reality all the skill and practice is wasted on doing stuff that shouldn't actually be that hard. 

Rounding an outside corner requires way more skill than it reasonably should rn. If players need hours of practice before they can round a corner, maybe there's something wrong. The new updates make it easier to do, AND it takes less time than jumping off the wall, rounding the outside of the corner in mid-air, and landing back on the wall.

The inability to land on ""the same wall"" again made no sense in many cases too. For those who aren't aware, Lucoo currently cannot ride on any wall that is the same angle as the wall he left. This meant that to get across a wide doorway (like the choke on Volskaya point B for example) Lucio players have to round an outside corner to get on the doorframe (see above), jump to the other side of the doorframe, then round another outside corner. On the new update it takes 1 jump.

My point is, Lucio players are mad that the time and effort they put into learning advanced wallride techniques is going to be thrown out the window. However, I feel that many of those ""advanced"" techniques were just overly complicated ways to perform movements that should have been simple. I admit there are certain techniques that were valuable that can no longer be used, but there are plenty of new rollouts that can be achieved by abusing the corner rounding in certain ways and jumping back to the same wall. Lucio isn't nerfed, he's just reworked (again).

Btw every Lucio main on this sub freaks out anytime he gets changed even the slightest and it's starting to get on my nerves. Remember when the glitchy, inconsistent jumping-off-the-wall-twice-instantaneously-to-get-more-momentum-than-you-should move got removed? Everyone lost their shit for a while, then went back to playing Lucio and forgot about it a week later.",Overwatch,1524228927.0,t3_8dnc87
Lucioball is one of the worst game-modes in a video game that I've ever played,"It's so fucking bad it's unbelievable. 

Lucio moves like a snail compared to the ball.

The launchpads and walls are hardly ever effective, if at all.

There's no point in chasing the ball as it will always be in range of only the person it's going towards, even if that person is very far away. Meaning the majority of the time it will just be both goalies hitting balls back and forth to each other over and over again.

The hitboxes are broken as hell.

The game will cancel out ONLY your boop if another player boops at the same time. Or vice versa. 

Some boops make the ball go upwards, some make it go backwards, others don't even register. 

The game punishes you for having a bad goalie way too hard. 

Whether or not you win the game is decided by luck and whether or not your goalie makes less mistakes than the enemy goalie.

Sometimes the ball goes into insane angles that make usually impossible situations possible. These are all luck based of course, as there's no realistic way you'll hit these intentionally.

Usually I wouldn't rant about something like this, but I just had to because of how bad it is.

Blocked my Duo for saying GG 2 EZ,"My friend and I played QP all the time together. we couldn't really play ranked because we were separated in ranked (they are bronze and I was diamond) 

So when they were online, we only played QP, and we did a bunch of memey stuff like 

Play the character you ha e no hours in
Play your least played role
Play with your most hated skin
Play with a character you want to be better in

We had fun until after a while they started saying GG 2 ez or just EZ after 

EVERY
SINGLE
WON
GAME

Even the games where the enemy team needed to touch the payload for .2 meters, and they would have won

I told my duo to stop saying that after every match because it was just unnecessary. I have a lot of sportsmanship, but I also have a pet peeve for unnecessary communication. Like, I cringe when people say UWU or other unnecessary shit in chat. 

So for a while, I didn't say anything and wondered if it was me being oppressive until our other friend started playing with us to help me grind the battle pass. 

Our friend hasn't played overwatch in like 4 years, but they spent a few years playing Rainbow six seife and 3 kingdoms, so they wanted a change in pace.

We played a few more matches, and we were winning games consistently since I'm a little cracked at support, and our friend is a really good Bastion/Zen player

My duo started saying GG 2 EZ and our friend was livid he told him to stop saying it because we weren't sweating and it's QP also the enemy tram wasn't toxic al all so it was just dumb.

Most games we would win because of me playing support or our friend shredding with Bas/zen.

MY duo would also tbag throughout the game. In odd situations

Like.....corner a poor mercy as Sig and chuck a Boulder at her and tbag. 

I told them I'd stop playing with them and block them if they continued.

Pulse bomb should get the same effects as Magnetic Grenade,"A) its an ultimate

B) its harder to land

It just doesnt make sense to me that a basic ability is significantly easier to escape than a bloody ultimate

Edit: I don't mean the lockon. Just the ability negate, and maybe the slow

Edit 2: okay, you can stop misinterpreting what I'm saying. What I am suggesting, is for pulse bomb to behave exactly as it does now, but negate certain abilities of who it's stuck to. So the only difference is, that it can't be shaken off once it's stuck to you.

Complicated take: Nade/anti healing ISN'T overpowered.,"Healing and damage or both just too high.

&#x200B;

Let's think about this for a second. 

&#x200B;

Right now, if you're a tank (or really anyone without a cleanse, strong escape tool, or incredibly survivability) and you get hit by a nade you just explode. Like, you die INSANTLY. I think many people will first point to ""well nade is just busted"" but if we remove anit heal from the equation and just look at healing and damage we get a clearer picture. Damage is extremely high and without high healing to compensate for the high amount of damage that everyone needs to tank, everyone dies too fast.

If we were to lower both the amount of healing and damage the impact of nade would be lower overall without changing it. ",Overwatch,1703633963.0,t3_18rlrqm

"Goodbye, Kaplan. Welcome, Kaplanbot-3000.","Before I begin, I'd like to say that I've never shied away from criticizing Blizzard. I've been complaining about Blizzard titles for as long as I've been playing them. I was an extremely vocal opponent to Blizzard's decision to wait until just two weeks before the beginning of Beta to announce that it would be small. I just want to point out that our reaction isn't only ridiculous, it may also prove to be costly.


Many people think that the biggest thing we'll lose out of this fiasco is a bland pose. (Seriously, we haven't seen the one they're replacing it with.) The real cost, IMO, is that Kaplan will be far less likely to speak to us casually from this point on. 


We've proven that we can't handle him making a mistake. We outright rejected his updated statement and are still demanding that he answer for the first. We've rejected the clearly evident fact that Blizzard commonly has sexualised characters in their games. We don't care that no gaming company has the money required to placate every individual complaint. Logically speaking, there is no way that this change is based solely on one complaint that was, at the time, exceedingly opposed by the community. We don't care, however. We're angry because we want to be angry.


Now even Kaplan's minor statements are likely to be meticulously examined by the PR Team prior to release. His presence on forums is likely to be replaced commonly to CMs. We'll hear less of him and his statements will have that all too familiar canned feeling that we always get from Blizzard.


Kaplan is going to be our main Dev for a long time. It would have been really nice to have a project director who can talk to us like he's just another gamer.

To All Those Complaining About Overwatch 2,"This goes out to all those criticising blizz for releasing ""basically an expansion"" as a whole new game.

Overwatch 2 is giving us:

- An entire story mode
- Highly certain hero addition of 10+
- Plenty of new maps
- Mission mode for every hero including custom abilities for each hero 
- New cosmetics for all existing and yet to be introduced heroes
- Push has been confirmed and there will most likely be 1 or 2 other new game modes
- A slight graphical update that modernizes the already beautiful game but retains the amazing art style
- A competitive game mode that by the time of launch, will try to resolve and balance NUMEROUS issues thanks to a team solely working on balancing the competitive play of the game
- A handful of Experimental modes will have been tried to test even more new gameplay changes
- An outbreak of players returning due to all the new things after the supposed ""death"" of the game
- Constant media relating to the game and a rebirth of the community (Youtube, Twitch, OWL, Netlifx?, etc)
- EVERYTHING FROM OVERWATCH 1 
- EVERY NON PVE RELATED ADDITION WILL ALSO BE COMING TO OVERWATCH 1

So with all this said, stop complaining and just wait till we have more info. Overwatch is coming up on its 4th Birthday, releasing a sequel including stuff many people asked for (Literally story mode) then complaining is very childish. Also I would like to just bring you to understand something, Overwatch 2 releases over 4 years after the launch of Overwatch. I want you to go search up how many Call of Duties, Sports games, and other games similar in the sense of YEARLY upgrades, and see how much you actually get for buying another full price game gets you in those markets. That's all, thank you for reading.

New Heros Should Be Free,"If Blizzard ever wants me to give them money they need to show integrity. Locking new heros behind seasonal game passes incentivizes the developer to make that new character over powered so they can motivate players to purchase the pass for access to that hero. Even if its a mistake that needs to get fixed it can take months to do so (see Sojourn). This makes the game an uneven playing field unless you pay money. I wonder what that concept is called. 

I wont pay for any skins or buy the battle pass until this is fixed. That money will be spent on other games that not only respect the players but also respect the integrity of their pvp game to provide fair matches by allowing access to all heros.",Overwatch,1669210765.0,t3_z2pdpa
Hot Take: The Battle Pass doesn't sound that bad,"I was just as annoyed as everyone else with the little information and hero locks regarding the battle pass for season one. However, with the new info they released, honestly a lot of my worries have been covered.

Battlepass is free to everyone, and the new heros are locked from comp play. Thats fair, its basically like the ""beta"" for those heros (I am fine with that, when a new hero was launched in the beta I wasn't annoyed some people got to test them out first because beta was only on PC). Also, they are switching away from the ""hard counter"" to more ""strong at this"", WHICH I LOVE. I am someone who very much so likes to stick with the character they pick, so this change of direction is actually really good news to hear. It also means not having a new hero for 1 month won't be as devastating.

Also, correct me if I am wrong, but the Premium pass is only 1000 credits right? Sure you can just outright buy it with real money, but that's the price of a legendary skin, and you get the new hero INSTANTLY. People would be ecstatic in OW1 if they only needed to pay 1000 to test the newest hero instantly on any platform.

So, I am happy with what I have seen. I still wish there was A LOT MORE publicity for OW2, its 30 days till launch and I haven't even seen a trailer, but I am still hopeful.

EDIT: To make this SLIGHTLY less controversial (Conversations are good keep it up), **I AM NOT SAYING I WANT HERO LOCKS**, in a perfect world I think the battlepass should be purely cosmetic. However, knowing the company we are talking about, I am fine with what i've seen, it could have been much worse.",Overwatch,1663255549.0,t3_xezn1v

Hard pill to swallow,"There is no such thing as being ""hard stuck"" in your rank cause ""bad teammates""

There are countless videos of streamers doing the  climb, one tricking a hero often into games where the entire enemy team is running hard counters and still winning

There is a reason you are the rank that you are.

Yes there are games that are unwinnable but if you have the skills to play at a higher rank you will get there cause if your a higher skill than your rank than on average you should be winning.

Even if you have zero game sense you can climb to diamond with pure mechanical skill (landing key shots and abilities).

I have climbed from bronze to low gm several times here are my suggestions

Tips:

Prioritize staying alive over getting kills

Prioritize the objective over getting kills (with exceptions)

Don't justify your death by saying ""well I killed the mercy so we traded"" if your carrying the game you need to stay up it's not an even trade

Stop forcing ""carry plays"" I see so many examples of people trying to be the hero and taking unfavorable fights sometimes it works out most of the time it doesn't

Every duel assess quickly whether you have an advantage or disadvantage if your at a disadvantage stop fighting the duel (if possible)

Wait for your moment/opening the big clips you see of famous players popping off largely happen not only because they are mechanically skilled but mostly because they wait for the right moment

Track the cooldowns that shut you down the hardest and wait for them to come out before going in

Learn to aim most pro hitscan players play at 800 dpi 3.5-5 sensitivity (with exceptions on certain heros) which feels slow but theres a reason.

Counter-swapping yes it is a part of the game but it is also a crutch if you have to counterswap your essentially saying I need the ability/hero advantage in order to win instead of learning how to outplay it and deepining your understanding how to play the game

Counterswapping may help you in the short term and yes there are situations where it is necessary but its detrimental to your advancement in the long term

Dont use ultimates on a fight that's already lost

Don't use ultimates on a fight that your team has already won

Understand when a team fight is won/lost

Support players, tanks do not have rear view mirrors you can see the tank and where he is going he cannot see you it is not always the tanks fault that he isn't LOSing you, you can move too/position to try to keep tank in los.

Coms: yes the community can be toxic but calling out targets can add an unbelievable amount of value and focus to the team

I've been playing since 2016 and not once have I ever seen being toxic/flaming a teamate improve the chances of winning",Overwatch,1700849641.0,t3_182y9no
I'm disappointed in the lack of effort Blizzard have put into expanding the lore of this game.,"I mean, obviously people will disagree but the lore is one of the main reasons I bought the game in the first place hoping for frequent animated shorts and comics, but over time it's become gradually clear that they aren't really sure what to do with progressing the story. I mean it's almost been *2 years* and lore-wise we're still focusing in the exact same place we were initially(Winston recalling) which is beyond annoying. 

Anyone disagree or have any thoughts?",Overwatch,1520007910.0,t3_81ffcn
Dallas Fuel xQc celebrating the Mercy nerf,,Overwatch,1517345373.0,t3_7u46sf
Why we need one-shots in Overwatch,"As much I hate **one-shot mechanics** since it makes the game extremely frustrating, but they're needed because they're **the best answers against pocket-healing**. Just like in Team Fortress 2, instant-kills (e.g Spy's backstab, Sniper's full charge headshot) is one of the best counter against a pocketed + overhealed enemy.

In some occasions, the enemy team has a DPS + Mercy duo but your Supports refuse to fill Mercy (or somewhat Zenyatta) to make the match even. One-shot heroes (Widow, Hanzo or somewhat Sojourn) are mostly the best way to deal against them. (If that also doesn't work, I'll go a flanker and harass/kill the other Support instead.)

Fighting a pocket-healed enemy in Overwatch is already frustrating since it's an uneven 1v2 match where you need to land more shots to kill, while the enemy can cripple / kill you with very few shots. Unlike in TF2, players receive less HPS when they take damage in combat, thus fighting a pocketed enemy is less frustrating than OW. I'm happy that Sojourn existed as I can simply farm rail gun energy on a Tank. Then, chip a few damage on the pocketed DPS and finally cripple / kill the DPS with a precise railgun shot instead of trying to land consecutive shots as Soldier:76 / Cassidy / etc. 

**""Shooting Mercy"" is easier said than done** because good Mercies are mostly well hidden. Shooting Mercy also means her boosted DPS would be raining fire on you without being pressured. If you manage to get an angle on hidden Mercy, you can be way out of position or cover (thus very exposed and easily punished). Lastly, Mercy is also hard to hit due to every 2.5 second aerial mobility + small hitbox. Plus, her hitbox also changes between Guardian angel, Gliding & Freefall.",Overwatch,1678759565.0,t3_11qtiy2

Some people will never be happy,"Some people will never be happy and it's usually how it is in most games. Some people want everything, like EVERY SINGLE THING for free. You know that the game has to make some money to keep creating content to it, right? What if you have to grind for a hero which will come every 2 month? Don't you have to grind for it in almost any game (not rpgs), if you don't buy it with your existing currency or your credit card? They are even giving you 3 new heroes for free if you own OW1.

People wanted content, now they are bringing more. This is a shooter game, they will of course make content with skins and heroes and maps. What do you expect them to do? What does valorant or apex or name any shooter do in the name of content other than these? But no, some of you can't be happy because you need to pay 10 bucks every 9 weeks and guess what, you don't even have to! The base game is free as a whole! You can grind games and complete challenges to boost your battlepass EXP and grind for the upcoming hero.

Don't pretend like you (not everyone, but some) are caring about overwatch 2 will flop or be the next valorant. You just want to consume every single thing that your pc can handle for free.

Sorry, but for like the last 5-7 years, things are not working this way. Devs have to make some cash in order to float the ship which we call content.

I'm not saying ""you must be happy with what they are feeding us with"". I'm saying, please not complain about every single thing. OW2 looks legit promising at the moment, none of us know what the future holds.

"Personally, I feel Overwatch 2 is slowly becoming superior to OW1","Hold your stakes and pitchforks, OW1 launch was an amazing game and deserving of its praise as a whole. I do feel however, after a stellar Blizzcon and an astounding amount of content + transparency and communication as clear as day, OW2 is slowly moving up

Sure, at the start it seemed the universe of Overwatch was falling apart due to massive controversies and seemingly ""betrayal"" that some gamers(tm) were shouting. However, OW1 had its fair share of awfulness that really tainted the game, even in the ""golden years"" of 2016-2018.

Remember Brigitte's launch and the Mercy rework that broke the game for months respectively? remember GOATS and double shield which were basically ""I win"" buttons that required **major** changes to the game's fundamentals? Most of all, **remember the 3 year content drought with absolutely no communication nor new substantial content the whole time?**

All this were extremely detrimental to the state of OW1. Name the last time we had a gamebreaking meta that lasted over a month, name the last time we had no content nor communication for over a **week.** 

The only real major flaw in OW2 we have right now is the monetization and foul stigma around cancellation of replayable PvE. Let me get this straight, if it wasn't for the ""expensive skins"" and battle pass that comes hand-in-hand with becoming free-2-play, the weekly events and major content drops every month (and probably more frequently than that) wouldn't be possible without this ""expensive"" live-service approach. 

2024 is looking to be superb for the game and franchise, especially if they keep up the constant content and communication and becoming independent from Kotick's greed. The light is shining at the end of the tunnel.",Overwatch,1701469418.0,t3_188o7xk

"Blizzard, get your shit together.","Didn't we learn from 2012-2014 that if you're going to hype the hell out of something, then you either deliver what you promised or dim everyone's expectations before launch? Hasn't the game industry learned from disasters like Duke Nukem Forever, Aliens: Colonial Marines, and Destiny about their incredibly awful launch day releases?

Didn't you learn this from Hearthstone, where you tried the same exact thing?

Are we seriously going to keep repeated the same exact mistakes every time a new AAA game gets released? Isn't the point of a closed beta to give feedback about the game itself from an almost overwhelming amount of people? Yes? Then how come only a handfull of people outside of the popular Youtube and streaming scene actually got beta keys?

How come people who have been banned from multiple blizzard games got keys? Does this mean you didn't have any type of guidelines for giving out the beta keys? I remember you used to have a list up of what determines you of getting into the beta, here's it from memory before you deleted it.

Your elligibility for getting into beta is determined by 4 things:

     What type of account you have
     What games you own 
     How early you signed up for the beta
     And general luck

The reddit community has already determined it doesn't matter how many games you own and how many hours you have in them, along with how long the account has been up, so that's busted.

Along with that, people who have been banned from blizzard games got the keys so the type of account doesn't matter.

People who signed up for the beta the second you could didn't get into it, yet streamers who didn't even sign up to begin with got the key, so that's also busted

The only thing left is luck, and that's the ONLY factor. Here's my improved list: 

     Pure Luck
     Or be popular.

So essentially you made a beta that contradicts itself by getting barely any feedback whatsoever, while making your fans feel like they don't matter at all and are less important than popular Youtubers.

Wait, if you gave random hackers and people who were banned from other blizzard games beta keys, then does that mean they also gave accounts that haven't been logged on for years them too?

I'm not saying that all of the streamers and Youtubers didn't deserve their keys. People like STAR_ and Jerma have been wanting to play it ever since gameplay trailers came out. They've been hyping it up for their fanbase, so they definitely deserved em. Boogie2988 used to play World of Warcraft for over 14 hours a day, even going on to say that World of Warcraft saved his life, so he was a huge mega fan of Blizzard. He got his key and he MORE than deserved it. 

But then there's people like Sky Williams, who've only shown 1 first person shooter on their channel in 1 video, and actively support League of Legends, the #1 biggest threat to their game Heroes of the Swarm, and he got a beta key.

If your goal was to isolate your community so you could make room for popular Youtubers and streamers to promote the game to subscribers who probably don't even have the minimum requirements in their PCs to run Overwatch, then congratulations.

You just treated your fanbase, the entire reason you exist, the entire reason you're rich, like second class citizens to make room for the people that will say ""lol memes"" and then move on to the next trend.

Some people may not agree with some of what I just said, but we can all agree on one thing.

On the Roadhog's client, he hit you while you were in plain sight.

For some reason, despite choosing that the hook has indeed landed, it tries to pull the target through the fucking wall, instead of bouncing to the original hit location and then pulling. 

This results in those crazy hooks where the chain is clipping through the wall and not actually pulling a target in.

Like it or not, the Roadhog hook is the ""shooter"" in this scenario, and the game should favor a landed hook through to completion.

We need an SR/MMR Wipe,"Alright you guys.  It's been 10 seasons.  Everyone is more or less locked into the public SR that the game shows, that we have all grinded for and wept over since day one.  Now when you complete your placements, the game already knows where you're going to be regardless of how well you perform - it's no secret that tons of people create alternate accounts, do placements, and wind up hundreds or thousands of SR higher than their ""main"" account, based on the visible SRs of the past and the hidden MMR.

After ten seasons - I propose that we do a full wipe.  Encase all of the visible SRs of the past in stone - let them be visible - but they should not affect Season 11 in any way.  Let there also be a wipe of hidden MMR.  Maybe even show us what the ""old"" hidden MMR was, just this once, then encase it in stone as well and start us afresh.

Advantages:

+This dissuades/stops RAMPANT smurf usage.

+People who do new season placement matches are placed closer to their actual skill level, rather than whatever the game has locked them into based on previous seasons.

+People may become aware of their ""hidden"" MMR and so know what to expect going forward.

+Discrepancies between hidden/visible may be analyzed.


Disadvantages:

-For maybe the first week of play - QP or competitive - it's Sandbox Mode again.  The elites are in with everyone else, but quickly get filtered out.  There is momentary chaos, for the greater long-term good.

It's kinda eye opening that we just needed to wake up and try harder, because I have no doubt that I'm gonna be able to take this guys to be in top shape by playoffs and hopefully win the season.

##### What's Going on?

> - ""Most of us have good energy but then we had a lot of tilting going on during the game too.""
- ""So we did exactly what we said not to do, that was the frustrating thing about that is like yeah, we had a plan set out and it was just like it went out the window as soon as the game started.""
- ""Yeah, we make a plan and we didn't follow the plan.""
- ""Like I think everyone knew what they were supposed to do, it just didn't happen.""
- ""There was a mixed idea of what was going on, a mixed idea of what to do at that time.""
- ""It's not one person's loss, it's a shared loss in the end.""

- [The Team](https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=39)

##### How are we going to overcome this for future matches?

> We're really trying to make a stronger core and really focus as a team on building up that teamwork. I think we're still really trying to put it together but, there's a very visible growth cohesion when it comes together to the squad.

- [Custa](https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=125)

##### However...

> We practiced our whole week on communication and I felt like our practice went really well but, we didn't really account for the stage, stuff wasn't working out. I kept listening and pretty much i get everything we have been working on the entire week started to break down entirely and all communications stopped.

- [KyKy](https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=266)

##### This is not only from a coaching perspective, but also inside the players minds.

> Stuff we noticed the most during the week of practices is we got really really really good at setting up team comms between everyone, but once we get on stage certain people talk a lot more and then essentially what ends up happening is everyone ends up talking too much, and you don't have an effective leader who you know who to follow. It's not necessarily team comms as in people not talking as much as it is people not listening or having a very clear structure on who to talk to; And that's what we started working on.

- [Seagull](https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=75)

##### Things are not looking good, we need to change.
 > - ""We're basically changing a lot of our practice strategies, we just wanna be more efficient, be more optimal on how we practice.""
- ""We made some decisions that's gonna directly affect how we play as a team and as a unit.""

- [KyKy, Custa] (https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=102)

&nbsp;
###### Conclusion


##### Stage 1 ended, things could have gone better.

> Based on the way we came in that (The Seoul Game) was accurate and then after that we've just kinda been going on a downhill slope of seemingly confidence, moral, and everything like that and trying to boost it back up is much more difficult than anyone can imagine. We still have so much to work on and improve because we really got into a hole that we need to find ourselves out of and we just need to basically realign our whole team and maybe just reevaluate our strengths and where we need to put them. I think our biggest concern for all of us, specially myself is just winning the entire overwatch league and winning every game counts but stage 1 is just 25% of it so, we'll get there.

- [KyKy](https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=526)

>To go from winning almost everything to ""Wow, we took a map"" is a very hard mental roller coaster for the rest of the team. 

- [Seagull](https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=487)

> People say it was a closer match, I would say we still underperformed a lot, I guess we were ok with winning that map but still, I don't think that really means anything to us. 

- [KyKy](https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=475)

> 
It's disappointing to lose but still an improvement. I guess the biggest improvement was that in the previous matches we had a lot of communication and teamwork issues, but a lot of them were alleviated in this matches. I think everyone is a little happier with our play, I think we sort of realized how we wanna play the game and just trying to make it work and hopefully with some more practices, more time, we can refine what we're doing because it looks a little sloppy at times, it looks a little unorganized, it looks like we don't know what we're doing which is all of the above honestly at times but, hopefully we can get rid of some of that and start winning some games 

- [Custa](https://youtu.be/-t6YsTqeKWY?t=530)


##### We Won 3 matches

> Good but, not enough.

- [EFFECT](https://youtu.be/-t6YsTqeKWY?t=412)

##### *We have failed to fulfill our commitments.*
&nbsp;

###### Presentation 

##### Who am I?


I am a Dallas Fuel fan.  
I'm the one that cheers for you.  
I'm the one that after every map won says: *""That's it my doggies!""*  
I'm the one that yells *POGGERS* after every Team Kill.  
But also...  
I'm the one who hates to see the team lose.  
I'm the one that still believes after finishing 3-7. 10th on the League.  
##### But I'm not the only one...


> Just wanna start by saying hope you guys are doing ok in practice right now and everybody is still ok, nothing is wrong in our end, we're still happy that you guys are working hard so thank you for trying to keep your heads together that's really important and like I said, come back strong I think you guys will see results immediately once you guys just figure out the game plan and you stick to it, even if we try this next game plan and it doesn't work out, you just gotta keep going to the drawing board man and eventually it will click I promise.   
Obviously we need to get some wins on the board and go out and win matches 'cause going to the games and have fun and just be confident 'cause you guys are all amazing players, and I know that the wins will come and I really do still believe that we're gonna be contending for a championship by the end of the season. Just really try and get some good practices and go hard on the matches so we can have fun.

&nbsp;

###### Addressing the issues:

&nbsp;

KyKy's original plan for this team:  

- Synergy between each other. (specially the newer players).
- Scrim.   
- Grind it out.  
- Everyone gets a healthy schedule.
- Self-evaluation.
- team meetings.


&nbsp;

Problems that got in the way:

- Tilting.
- No proper plan.
- Communications stopped.
- Lack of an effective leader *to follow*.
- Lower Confidence, moral, etc.
- Teamwork issues.
- Unorganized approach to the game.

&nbsp;

###### Fixing the Issues

&nbsp;

I think the best way to get over this moment is to re-arrange all of the team's schedule.  
Focus it into a more Team-based Lifestyle. Healthier, more active, and productive.

Here's how I propose to you the new Schedule should run:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*Legend*

- Heavy    

Heavy days should be High Intensive days, the next day there shouldn't be any Important.

- Medium 

Medium applies to the days previous to any Game Day or similar schedule. This are to end early so the Team can get a good night sleep.

- Light

This applies to Every Sunday, Team needs a time to relax, de-stress, Healing. On these days, minimal training should be done and they should enjoy the day.

- GameDay

On Game Days, Light training should be done in the morning, followed up by a ""Preview"" of their match for the day. Strategies previously practiced should be reviewed to strengthen team concentration.  
Quick Warm-up just before being called to play.

- Summary

This is to be the following day after the last game of the week. On this day we should review:

1. Mistakes made.
2. How we performed compared to the previous week. 
3. Important notes if any.

&nbsp;

##### Daily Schedule

A day for the team should be(Hours may vary, I hold no information so I'm not able to provide an accurate Time):

&nbsp;

#### Heavy Days

- 7:00 AM - Wake up

Team get 30 mins to get up of bed and make their bed.

- 7:30 AM - Morning Exercise

Team should do a quick walk, run, yoga, cardio, etc. to start their bodies working.

- 8:00 AM - Shower and Breakfast

Team gets 1 hour to shower, get ready and eat breakfast.

- 9:00 - Morning Meeting

Team gets together and evaluates:

 1. Who they will play against in the week.
 2. What maps are to be played.
 3. What players play with these teams.
 4. How will we approach the matches.
 5. Personal opinions.


Before we setup the plays for the week, we need to review who we play and how they play.  
Some teams are popular for their Genjis, some because of their Snipers, others for Tracers, or even Tank Heavy comps.  
Every team plays differently, they use multiple techniques, and a simple cookie cutter approach won't be enough to compete against them.  
The team should discuss and form a strategy against every team.
> We play against ""x"" team. maps are ""a"" ""c"" ""d"" ""g"".  
On ""c"" map we know they might play ""a"" ""b"" and ""d"" players.  
If this is true, we might want to approach them by countering them with ""Play 1"" ""2"" or ""3"".  
We can use our own ""Z"" ""y"" ""x"" players for these roles and go against them.  
If this doesn't work, we should go to ""this"" approach.  
For map ""d"" do we need to change something? ok, switch our player ""x"" for ""v"".   
Does everyone agree? Yes, No, Why? Do we need to change something? Another comp or strategy?

Team communication is important, so everyone gets a chance to make a contribution to the play.   
Once everyone agrees with their position, it's time to work it out.


- 9:30 AM - Morning Scrims  

Team practices the plays agreed on each map, including various ""Possibilities"" the enemy might throw into the game.

- 1:00 PM - Lunch Time

Team gets an hour of Relax and food to recharge energy.

- 2:00 PM - Personal Growth

Players work on their personal performance. Training Headshots, certain characters, new roles, etc.

- 3:00 PM - Evening Scrims

Same as morning.

- 6:30 PM - Daily Challenge

Every day after evening scrims, the team must separate into 2 teams. Each day a different player is to be chosen as captain for each team. The losing team must prepare/buy Dinner for the whole team.

- 7:00 PM - Exercise

Members are to train to be more fit. Physical and Mental health are important to the player.  
Training for higher endurance, more energy, and agility will help the player Expand the time for his peak performance, reduce exhaustion and have better reflexes.   
It's good that [Timou started working with a PT](https://twitter.com/DF_Taimou/status/960434641202065408), he shouldn't be the only one.   

- 8:00 PM ~ - Dinner & Personal Time

Eat, talk, refresh. At the end of the day, players are left to Stream, practice or other.

-  ~ 12:00 PM - Sleep

Players need a good night rest so that they can continue their top performance the next day.


&nbsp;

#### Medium Days

Players go to bed 1 or 2 hours earlier than on heavy days in order to get more rest before GameDay.

&nbsp;

#### Light Days

Sundays are to be free to the team, it's the time we can use to go on a local trip, go to an amusement park or something to get *Fresh Air*.  
This is to increase Team morale and get a proper refresh for next week.   
Any training is to be at minimum level, enough to keep the *muscle memory* going.   


If Review Days land on this day, First is Review, then Light scrimm, then free time.


&nbsp;

#### GameDay

On GameDays, the team will do a quick scrim in the morning, get ready for the match and the proper warm-up before the Game.

&nbsp;

#### Review Day

On this day, we analyze our performance for the week, we see what went good and bad, and throw some feedback on it. Constructive criticism is **Highly Encouraged** here.

For example:

&nbsp;

[Stage 1, Week 4, Fusion, Eichenwalde](https://youtu.be/BrHRz0KOcAY?t=320)

After losing A to the Fusion, we set up our defences around the corner. Cocco on the small roof and the rest of the team on top of bridge.  
Carpe sees Cocco and dives with Hotba, Cocco uses jump to go back to Chips. 
Meanwhile EFFECT and Mickie drop down to fight the point, rest of the team joins fight and we manage to take the fight.
But then...  
We go back to the same positions, this time Mickie stands behind the cart.  
When they come to start the fight Cocco initiates by dropping to them, use bubble and escapes the fight.  
Mickie stands there and can't join him.  
By initiating too early we had to back up and refresh, meanwhile the fusion got their comms ready and this time, they moved.  
Dived Taimou and Harry. Down.   
Chips dies in the back.  
Cocco and EFFECT get on point but EFFECT falls to Carpe, Hotba and ulting BoomBox.  
Probably we initiated because Cocco was spotted, so he decided to engage.
They already saw us waiting for them, and now they were expecting us there, our reaction was to go in earlier than we should have. They got on our mistake and used it to engage their fight.
Losing this fight took them all the way to almost get point 2.   
So maybe xQc could say something to him, like tips for better positioning, or Q's for when to engage.  
xQc is still a part of the team, active or suspended, so he should also be active on practice.

&nbsp;

Another Example:  
[Same match, now we attack.](https://youtu.be/BrHRz0KOcAY?t=723)

After pushing them to back and getting the kill on Fragi, Taimou goes inside the left house.  
The fusion is inside the back house.   
We see Fragi being ress'd, so we know Mercy is there too. Notice we are hidden, since they focus on the rest of the team in the middle of the map.  
We shoot at the D.va and she acknowledges our position using Matrix to repel the shots if Taimou were to continue.
Then Neptuno Shows himself for about 1^1/2 secs.  
By shooting a little too early we gave our position and missed the chance to kill Mercy.   
By having patience and keeping to the plan (assuming the plan was to counter PharMercy with Widow) we could have snowballed from the Mercy pick.    
Neputo flies away, uses Valk and ShaDowBurn kills Taimou.


By figuring out where we messed up and improving, we are able to strengthen our weakest link. Therefore becoming a stronger team.

&nbsp;

###### Addressing *Leadership*. 

&nbsp;

When it comes to the team leader, there are different opinions on the team:

&nbsp;

> Playing without Timou in the starting line-up makes it really difficult to have decisive calls on the game because he's such an in-game leader.

- [Seagull](https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=294)

> Custa is more of the nice leader, where Timou is the Hard leader.
Having someone who does that just really gets people going in a certain way on stage and it keeps people focused. You don't want to listen Timou say ""Why didn't you do this?"".

- [KyKy](https://youtu.be/uv-EOgfJv2I?t=302)

&nbsp;

First of all, we need to know difference between a *Team Captain* and a *Team Leader*.    

- A Team Captain tells the team what to do to achieve victory.
- A Team Leader works with the team to be victorious.

&nbsp;

Keeping this in mind, we need to find out who is the one that makes the plays, who ""calls the shots""?.
But more importantly...   
Who is willing to give everything for the team?   
Sacrifice everything so that the team may succeed. 

If we get players just because they can play a position they will perform for the money.  
If we get players that believe what we believe they will perform with blood, sweat and tears.  
Maybe Dennis had this position. Maybe he's the missing part of the puzzle.

&nbsp;

###### Team Building

The most important part of our team, is our core.  
*We ride together, we die together.*   
And consistency is how we make it.  

- We make a plan, we stick to it.
- We do something, we do it together.

We need to trust our teammates, trust the fellow coaches.   
If we don't go through it together, we will never achieve victory.  
Here [punctuality](https://clips.twitch.tv/SpotlessSolidOrangeCoolCat?tt_medium=create) is very important.  
Members who lack of this consistency are to receive some sort of punishment for [*letting the team down.*](https://youtu.be/TRbRH0Pdmz0?t=240)  
Team is the [#1 Priority.](https://youtu.be/TRbRH0Pdmz0?t=273)

- Working out together.
- Playing together. 
- Eating together. 
- Spending time together.

Are some examples of how a Relationship is built, and trust gained.

&nbsp;

###### Communications

&nbsp;

In the mid-fight everything goes fast, at times so fast that we don't even know what we're going through.   

When things get out of control we need to have Basic ***Consistent*** comms.   
Comms stop -> Tilting starts

###### Tilting

Part of our training is to reduce tilting as much as possible, If we could, Eliminate it completely.  
We should work on Expanding our trust, the more *companionship* we have, the more we can rely on our mates.

Every position has his own POV because of their positioning, 12 eyes looking on the match.

Together we share ""tactical"" comms and the enemy doesn't surprise or ***C9*** us.

&nbsp;

##### An open letter to the Team

&nbsp;

###### xQc:

Félix, I know you had a rough start. Fined, Banned and ""Smoked and Rolled"".  
As a fellow Monkey I know what you're capable of and bring to the team.  
You're hyperactivity is your blade of ""2"" sides; Cheers the team and gets you in trouble. If you try to *recognize* when you're being over-reactive, you can evade problems that we had before. Don't give up.  
P.S. Clean your room at least once a week, that is not the jungle of a true champ. Go get' em Doggie!

&nbsp;

###### Custa:

G'day Mate,   
Team looks up to you as a Leader, I can see that you provide feedback on the situation the team is going on and you do a good job.   
In a way, you are the tip of the spear.
G'luck mate.

&nbsp;

###### Taimou:

Timo, dude something that is special to you is that you can play multiple positions depending on what the team needs.
You Tank, you snipe, you bang, you've done it all.   
Because of this, you know how multiple positions work and what needs to be done when.   
It's good that you emphasize on what the team is doing wrong, so that it only happens ***ONCE***.   
Keep working hard, you truly make a difference in our team. 

&nbsp;

###### EFFECT님:

현, 저음 부터 엔비 봤을때 니 트레이서 스타일 너무 좋아서 엔비 팬 됐다.    
요즘 좋은 하루 많이 없겠지만 이게 아직 시작이야~, 아직 시즌 1은데 시간 아직 많아.   
앞으로도 팀처럼 같이 끝까지 가자.   
우리 재일 잘하면 기모띠잖아~   
ㅋㅋㅋ 맞이? 화이팅!

&nbsp;

###### Seagull:

Bran ""The Bird Man"" Don.   
Ever since Overwatch was released, you became a Legend and many people started following you like if you were the OW god.  
Your experience on both inside and outside the game lets you be in the middle of everything and coordinate the *perfect* strat.   
Keep doing Great!

&nbsp;

###### Mickie: 

Mickie, I'm sorry, I don't speak Thai yet.   
You are the team charisma. You happy -> Team happy.   
We need you to be always happy and share your positive feelings.  
Thank you for always making us feel better.

&nbsp;


###### cocco:

Chris, If there's something that I can admire about you is the playmaker you are. You see everything and just say to the team:
> we do this that and Boom!

GG's You won the fight.

I like how you guide the team, and hopefully you can continue take care of us.

&nbsp;

###### chipshajen:

Chips dude, I remember back in the day we saw you play Ana and it was Legendary, the fact that someone can pull those plays you do in the Top-Tier of the game is amazing.  
Having you is a Big Asset for the team, Thank you for your Support throughout the Season, we need of you to get to the Final.

&nbsp;

###### HarryHook:

Harry Carry Hook.   
Hombre, te he visto en Healer y en dps, pero aun asi digo: 
> Este tio los trae corriendo como en Pamplona.

Tu como el capitán del equipo, los has dirigido a la Copa en APEX y en el Contenders.   
Eres testigo de lo que que es capaz el equipo.   
A los haters mandalos a su madre.  
Confio en ti y espero verlos en la cima  de nuevo.  
No os preocupeis, que hoy empieza la Victoria!

&nbsp;

###### aKm and Rascal:

Welcome to the team, your new home.  
We hope to work together so we can become Number 1.
Best of luck to all of you!

&nbsp;

###### KyKy:

We could talk about game mechanics all day, but we know that what really matters is how the Team is guided Inside and Outside the Game.  
You're doing a good job, this team trusts you, and it's only going to be a matter of time until we get back to the top.  
Can't wait to see the Rise.  

&nbsp; 

###### Hastr0:

The reason I follow this team is because I believe in the Vision we share.  
We have an international roster because we believe that not everyone can become a Champion, but a Champion can come from anywhere.  
Every part of this organization is tailored to reach that goal.  
And seeing the many accomplishments we've had, there's no doubt this is the way to success.   
Thank You.

&nbsp;

##### Why I do this.

6 months ago, I decided to take a break from life.  
I used to come home from work and play Overwatch, I fell in-love with the game and how Blizzard works around it.  
I wanted to be part of The Overwatch League.  
I spent this time so that I could join a team and to be honest, there's nothing else I want right now that to hold the Trophy at the end of the season.  
My previous sport experience didn't transfer exactly to the game.  
I can do a *3-pointer* or  *Bend it like Beckham* but, I couldn't get Aimbot-like aim or Game winning mechanics.   
Soon I need to find a job to go on with life.    
So if I couldn't get a chance to hold it on Season 1, at least my team would.

&nbsp;

Thank you.

"Don't say things like ""gg ez"" or ""get rekt'd bads"" when you win.","Seriously, you're not cool or funny, you're just being a massive douche. 

I'm sure most people set it to avoid you, be a douche enough and get ready for 20 minute solo queues. 

Who cares if you destroyed the other team, no need to be an ass about it... Shit most of the time it was a close game down to the last couple seconds, yet there is still that one douche canoe that has to say it was an easy win



Sorry for the rant

The 24th hero will be a teambuff oriented hero with speed-increasing and healing capabilities,"I can say this confidently because Blizzard has excellent design principles with all of its heroes, and telegraphs certain abilities using colour-coded abilities. Because of how fast-paced Overwatch games are, colour needs to carry lots of information in order to be digested by the player as quickly as possible. I believe that the paint colours shown in the latest teaser indicate something about the 24th hero's abilities.

The most obvious example is the colour yellow. It is **almost exclusively** used to indicate healing. Every hero whose main role is to heal has a large amount of yellow in their default skin. The only support character to not have any yellow in their skin is Symmetra. Zen's Orb of Harmony, Mercy's Healing Staff, Lucio's healing passive, and Ana's Biotic Rifle all have yellow aura's/bullets. Even for non-support heroes, almost every ability that heals is yellow. Roadhog's Take a Breather, Bastion's self-repair and Soldier:76's Biotic Field are all yellow. The only non-yellow healing ability in the game is Mei's Cryofreeze, probably to keep continuity with her Ice Wall, and well, yellow ice kinda looks like frozen piss. 

Another less-obvious example is the use of purple. Every debuff in the game is represented with purple. These are: Zen's Orb of Discord, Ana's Biotic Grenade, and Sombra's Hack. It's also worth mentioning that Sombra, a hero who's entire role is to disrupt and debuff the enemy team, uses a lot of purple in her outfit. There was a post on this subreddit about how Blizzard made Sombra magenta because magenta is a colour that isn't on the colour spectrum = stealthy and invisible. It's a cute idea, but it's not true. Sombra is purple because *purple is specifically colour-coded to represent debuffing.*

With that being said, I hope you can see how Blizzard thinks very carefully about the usage of colour. I can say with 99% certainty that the presence of yellow in Efi's paint choices confirms that the new hero has healing capabilities. Whether or not that means that they can heal teammates or themselves only is unknown, but it's worth noting that all heroes so far that use yellow in their actual skin (not just their weapons/abilities) can heal themselves *and* teammates. As for the green, the usage of green in Overwatch suggests speed. The only other hero that uses a lot of green in his skin and abilities is Lucio. This can also be backed up by how the robot Efi is creating is the successor to the OR15. In other words, Efi is making the OR16, or in leet-speak: [ORYX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryx) , an African animal which is pretty damn fast (note also the horns). Speaking of Efi, her colour palette just so happens to closely match that of her creation. It's without a doubt an intentional design feature intended to express particular characteristics.",Overwatch,1488313169.0,t3_5wq60n
Hard to swallow pills: DPS is the weakest and least important of the 3 roles,"Multiple tanks have high damage abilities/primary fires and abilities that can one shot, Moira, Lucio, Baptiste, and Brigitte are more self sufficient than most DPS, Ana takes the same amount of shots to kill enemies as fucking McCree does and also has an instakill combo, etc. 

DPS offers NOTHING the other roles don't already have. They damage and sometimes CC. That's it. Tanks have protective abilities/sustain, high health, damage, and CC. Supports have high sustain, healing, damage, and CC. 

This game goes back to being fun when frontlines and supports stop just DPS with extra abilities.",Overwatch,1572334052.0,t3_domfvk
"Scatter arrow's function should be to shoot around corners/in to enclosed spaces, not to make up for a lack of aim.","After introducing some tweaks (e.g. not scattering from the ground) scatter arrow could be buffed allowing it to actually do what it's supposed to: Hitting hiding targets. The ability's current use is rather silly and doesn't fit the ""sniper theme"" in any way.

The main purpose of the ability should not be ""it's easier to hit than headshots"".",Overwatch,1494838152.0,t3_6b99nm
2CP was way better than Push,"We all gave 2CP shit for being one of the worst gamemodes but it was actually one of the most fun, challenging and fair game modes compared to push. Push is one of those, you win the first fight and you will generally win the game due to staggering and how the maps are designed. Sure its a lot more fair on paper, but in the reality of competitive, I feel like its just poorly designed.

I have yet to meet a person who has enjoyed push.

BRING BACK HANAMURA

Edit: Seems this topic is a 50/50. I mean to each their own in the end, just haven't had a good experience on push, even when winning hard. It feels unfair to the enemy team and the walking is long.

Edit 2: My point is 2CP was bad, a ton of people hated it, but with the move to 5v5 it might actually be viable. Push just doesn't feel good to me. I wish they would rework it, or try throw one 2CP map back in as a test. Or rework 2CP, the maps are awesome, but they need some tweaks.

The game is in a good state right now(relatively),"**Disclaimer: opinion incoming. Before you say I don't know what I'm talking about and downvoting, I invite you to read the post and try to see my point of view. I have played and experimented very in depth with the buffs and nerfs we've recently gotten. Feel free to tell me your opinion and correct me if you must. After all, I'm only plat.**

We all know blizzard has no idea of how to run their game with them working on PvE for years before deciding that somehow it was a good idea to throw it to the trash, making a trash in-game economy, sloppy battle passes every now and then, and having balance issues every single time a hero comes into the game.

However, I think that relative to prior seasons or ages, the game is not that bad right now, and you can more than perfectly have a decent experience in it.

The buffs and nerfs (Mauga's, most notoriously) we got recently are more radical on paper than once you actually play the game.

**Orisa:** the unkillable Horse isn't back, unlike I've seen people say. Orisa got no survivability buffs whatsoever outside what was a literal indirect Mauga nerf, and her having virtually no falloff damage isn't as oppressive as people claim because we have Ramattra, who has no falloff range and does close to the same damage as Orisa with his void accelerator. I played pretty much every tank into her and played her as well and I can confirm that she can still get rolled by just, well, playing like you'd play against Orisa.

**Sojourn:** she did become significantly stronger but not because she has that raw strength, but because she can use her railgun more often, so I've also not felt her being such a big issue like she was when the game launched, not even close. I played her and it felt more chill then broken, which is how it felt at launch.

**Mauga:** Now the elephant in the room, Mauga. He wasn't burned down to the crust of the earth like the silver players who climbed to plat by playing him claim. Now he is a character, that's the way I can put it. You have to actually manage your resources as him and play smart with your CDs. I even bothered myself to play Mauga against Orisa, which is supposed to be now the worst matchup, relying on my skill and gamesense, and it was a pretty winnable experience, and I did win.

I've experimented like crazy the last patch over the last three days and I think Overwatch is in a good state to play right now, with only the same issues as always remaining, which are more corporational rather than gameplaywise.",Overwatch,1705077308.0,t3_194z9y4

Got placed in Plat and couldn't Solo Q out of it. Bought another account and had no problem winning after being placed in Diamond. ELO hell is real,"I've had my main account since launch, I had been placed Diamond every season up until this one where I got placed into platinum. I only solo q and have not been able to crawl out of plat. I'd say on average out of 10 games roughly 6 or so has someone throwing, people locking 4-5 DPS characters, or someone leaving. Every previous season when I had placed in Diamond I had no problem solo queing and progressing upwards. Last season I finished at 3300~ or so. This season I'm at 2500~. 

My play has not gotten worse, the teammates have. People will vehemently deny that ELO hell exists, but it does, at least in platinum. To test this I bought another account and I did my placements. No surprise I got put into Diamond and I've played my way up to 3200~ as of now.

As much as people want to say ""if you're actually that good  you'll get out of it eventually"" it's not true. Carrying 5 other people is not viable every game. It does not matter how well you do on your own, this is a team game, if one guy on your team is building Torb turrets in spawn you're not gonna win 99% of the time. If you have 4 people refusing to get off DPS the odds of you winning are not high.

Your efforts as a single individual almost never outweigh terrible play/throwing/leaving from your team in solo q at platinum level. Solo q at platinum is just not a viable strategy regardless of how well you play.",Overwatch,1499782065.0,t3_6mmfdl

This beta is hard on people with depression,"Posted as a throwaway, because I don't want to be accused of using pity to get a beta invite.

This beta is hell. 

So much hype, so much buildup, and a definitive beta date. And when beta rolls around, few people from the general public get access. You could argue that we were all told that this was going to be a ""typical closed beta,"" except most closed betas are kept within the small community of people drafted for that purpose. This one is broadcast for everyone to see. It causes canimosity for the people who don't get the participate and can only watch - that streamer term everyone calls ""salt."" For a depressed person, it causes pain.

I honestly don't know how many people are in a similar situation. I somehow think gamers would have a higher percentage of people with depression, just cause gaming offers an escape. I've had a stress headache pretty much 24/7 since the beta started, which just seems to get worse with every ""beta wave"" that doesn't include me. People joke about a conspiracy to keep certain people out; people like me tend to actually believe it. Watching streams doesn't help, it just hurts more to see other people enjoying the game, and me not.

It makes no sense. I'm emotionally wrecked over a stupid video game. But it's the truth. I just want this closed beta stuff to be over with as soon as possible, because I'm pretty sure I won't get to participate.

Anyway... when you complain about salt, realize that some people may be hurt far more than you might think, and throwing it back in their face is just causing more pain.",Overwatch,1446246053.0,t3_3qwhpp

They spend the whole game flaming their team's 'terrible' picks (while playing perhaps the most situational healer) then at the end complain that 'nobody protected me ... how could I heal?'

Huh.

So you're questioning why Blizzard made Jack gay.

Did you question why Blizzard made Ana, Gabriel, and Amelie straight?

Nope. So it's only weird when a character is gay.

Necrotic Orb is a half baked rework.,"I just dont understand the logic that went into this.

You have taken one of the lower skill ceiling heros and given them a tiny skillshot which will only be properly leveraged in high skill / pro play. Not only that but it feels so underwhelming to use. What really confuses me is that it doesnt seem hard to have just gone a little bit further and made this better for everyone. Noone below gold is orbing a genji blade or dva bomb for that satisfying feeling, its just a tiny ball that will mildly inconvenience a tank every so often and whiff on dps constantly, then you wait 16s to do it again.

* It needs to bounce, moira's orbs bounce, its satisfying, maybe just one bounce. More skill expressive and engaging. Geometry is fun.
* At max range it should explode applying its effects in a radius, on indirect hit it should apply a reduced version of its effects. More low skill friendly, not overwhelming for the enemy team.
* Its cooldown is too long, with a weakened non direct version of the debuff maybe it can be brought down. 16s feels awful, it takes ages to generate ult charge. no just no...
* Change its damage to be a DOT to be more inline with how old damage orb worked, lets be honest the DOT ticking noise does something for us, its a nice feeling.

With these changes you now have a version of this ability which works for everyone. Landing a multi player AOE DOT is going to make people feel good about this ability, a shorter cooldown makes her more engaging as she was before, lesser debuff without the precision keeps it balanced.

I get that old damage orb wasn't great, it feels awful to die to one in most situations, fair enough for removing it, can we please just put this one back in the oven. No idea why this was released as it is now.",Overwatch,1657622958.0,t3_vx8an5

In 5v5 you really need to be aware of the decisions you make and when u make them. Simply just flanking with a dps can be enough time gone from your team they they are down a person before u finish your flank leaving you in a 4v5. I personally love the challenge.

Mauga is an insult to tanks.,"So I came back to overwatch after playing it in 2019, right. I thought it was pretty fun. I liked playing Lucio and also zarya with rein. Dva was great when u could dive with dva while another tank “held the line” for me to retreat to. In 2019 I stopped because Genshin impact got my attention. 

Now I come back after getting bored of Genshin. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I see one tank only. So I’m thinking okay, so did they add any new heroes. As a tank player, I’m obviously concerned about the state of tanking. 

Little did I know they added this dps tank called MAUGA(Rammatra is fine but a little busted and survives a little too long). That guy literally goes against every sort of tank playstyle I know. If I understand it correctly, his whole shtick is to shoot at people to heal. And if he shoots more he heals more. His ult makes him shoot infinitely. 

So basically, he doesn’t cover and protect his team and make space for his team(other than that charge that is “unstoppable”, whatever the fuck that is supposed to mean). The only thing this guy does is Crowd control with his ult, which is basically a death sentence. There’s no way of saving anybody in there, unless an Ana gets in and throws her nade and pray that the people in there kill him fast enough. 

If there are 2 tanks, like the classic dva and reinhardt team, rein can use his shield to protect his team for a while from Mauga while the dva goes into the backline and kills the supports pocketing mauga. But now with one tank, the only tank I can play is sigma to absorb all his bullets and use accretion to stun him. There’s no more creativity in what the tank can do except just stay in the frontline and shoot and block the tank. And keep doing that until mauga dies. Then the whole enemy team gets wiped as they realise they centred their whole strategy around this tank. 

Mauga being created is already a travesty to overwatch tanking. Who would create a tank whose job is doing damage to survive? That sounds like what a dps would do(ahem doomfist before he got moved to tank). There’s nothing much Mauga does as a tank, and I think it’s a shitty and lazy way to create a tank that is busted purely because it does dps and u can turn off your brain playing it.",Overwatch,1703846828.0,t3_18tkf1g
Suggestion: Shadow-mute words like 'ez' in all-chat,"I can safely assume that nobody likes to see 'gg ez' when they lose. There are also the more severe cases of players telling their opponents that they are cancer, their mum is a whore etc. 

My suggestion is that Blizzard has a list of offensive words that they shadow-mute i.e. When a player types a sentence containing any of these words in all-chat, their message is only visible to them and their team.

Such words include ez, noob, fuck, variations of 'mum', kill yourself, cancer etc. I'm pretty sure Blizzard could figure thr list themselves.

It should be silently patched and most people would not even figure it out. 

Even though it does not completely remove toxicity (e.g. team flaming is still visible as this is difficult to implement for team-chat), I think it would go a long way to combat the problem.

I really hope CS:GO players stay away from this game... very tired of their negativity.,"Sorry a bit of a rant but... 


I used to play a lot of CS:GO. I got Global while solo queuing the whole way which is quite an achievement in that game considering the number of obstacles such as people who are ""de-ranking"" or just plain trolling.


One day I simply deleted the game and uninstalled cold turkey. My CS:GO knife is still on my account but I don't care. I couldn't take the toxicity and negativity of CS:GO players anymore. It really felt like 99% of the matches I played in had some guy either on my or the enemy team saying, ""Why are you so salty?"", or an accusation of someone on the enemy team being a hacker.


If you've played CS:GO for any extended period of time you know what I'm talking about. That community sucks and I hate it. It's loaded with the most immature, negative internet tough guys. When those toxic players were in the Overwatch Beta, they stuck out like a sore thumb. They spent more time typing and letting us know how much we suck, how broken the game is, than playing the game itself. I really hope they stay in CS:GO and stay away from Overwatch.


I've been playing since bunny hopping in 1.3. CS will always have a place in my heart due to nostalgia but like a bad ex girlfriend, CS will remain permanently part of my past.



Edit: I'm not saying that all toxic players are CS:GO players but that was my personal experience from the roughly 6 times I saw that level of negativity during the open beta. I'd be nice and kindly ask if they play CS:GO too. Also, I think it's much more likely we will get players from other FPS games so since CS:GO has millions of players it's likely many will be from there.",Overwatch,1463411022.0,t3_4jlkbp

Closed Beta Access removed after purchasing Overwatch via BNET,"Hi guys,

I would like to know if anyone experienced something similar regarding the Overwatch Closed Beta Access.

I got access to the Overwatch Stress-Test last weekend.
After the weekend I could still play.
Yesterday evening for example the game was playable for me and I played several games.

I was curious und looked if I could post in the CLOSED Beta Forum.
I was able to post and would have been able to start threads or answer to posts.

This was a clear indicator for me, that I was in the closed beta.

Before going to bed I decided to preorder Overwatch via B.net. [Origins Edition]

Here comes the turnaround:
After the purchase a buddy asked me to play another game with him.
So I decided to play a last game for the night.
But the Play-Button was greyed out.
Restarting the B.net-Client did not help.
Manually starting the EXE ended the login-process at ""Authenticating"".

The B.net-Support told me that they can not see if I was really flagged for the Closed Beta.
They even told me they can't see any information regarding Overwatch at all, because the game is still in beta.
It seems like there is nothing they can do.

Did this happen to anyone else?
Any idea how to fix this or who to write to?

Not having the beta does not kill me, but having it would be way cooler ;-)

Thanks for reading.

5v5 is fine; you just have to learn to ACTUALLY play your role and work together.,"It's been a couple days since beta release, and I've already seen plenty of complaints about 5v5. Honestly, I think with time it'll work out, because the root of the mistakes is people now actually having to work together and learning to defend teammates instead of playing selfishly and independently. 

 Tanks actually have to learn to be environmentally aware and know when its appropriate to be aggressive, DPS actually have to learn to strategize and protect teammates instead of just themselves, and support have to utilize their skillsets more to encourage longer survivability. 

In my opinion, 5v5 is just reinforcing people to actually learn their heroes and not just pray on their ultimates to be game changing. It'll be a learning curve at first, but I think that's the point. I didn't wait this long just for the gameplay to be exactly the same.",Overwatch,1651165162.0,t3_udzpcb
"The Loot Boxes earned for the first 9 wins of a week should be tied to Quick Play, not Arcade","Title.

Seen this suggestion start to pop up more and more frequently, and I think it would be a fantastic change.  I think the change makes sense based on the definition of the modes that most of us probably use:

* **Quick Play:** Play a ""real"" game of Overwatch without the stakes of Competitive Play.  Although not required, teamwork and reasonable group compositions are still encouraged, as the victory conditions in this mode revolve around objective-based team play.  
* **Arcade:** A ""just for fun"" side option to the primary Overwatch experience.  Great for screwing around, trying goofy things, and just having fun with no expectations of stress or tryharding.

I think those definitions are fair enough.  Now, let's look at some common complaints we see arise.  Just off the top of my head:

**1)** Many people ask for a competitive-ruleset mode without the SR gain/loss.  Comp-lite, where they can go to play with real teams of organized folks trying to win.

**2)** Lot of complaints about the fairness of Arcade modes.  Lots of complaints about the unpredictability of Mystery Heroes, or the overbearing presence of some characters in modes like FFA or Team Deathmatch.

**3)** Lots of complaints about attitudes towards Quick Play mentality -- some believe players should always try to make a real team comp, where others believe that as long as they are actually trying to win, team comp shouldn't matter.  Valid points on both sides of this argument and I'm not trying to go down that rabbit hole.

Why do these complaints arise?  For #1, people want a mode that isn't competitive, yet still has at least *some* incentive to win a match.  For #2, people want ""tryharding"" to not be as prevalent or encouraged in Arcade.  For #3, sentiments echo those from #1.

**Moving the weekly 3 loot boxes from Arcade to QP solves all of these, among other things.**

If Arcade is supposed to be the no-holds barred goof-off zone, then take away the win incentives so you don't get folks like me just looking to grind out 9 wins in the most cheesy and efficient manner possible.  If QP is supposed to encourage (but not necessarily require) teamwork and reasonable comps, give people a reason to care about winning perhaps more than just listlessly practicing their worst hero or role.

I really see no downsides to this approach, it seems long overdue!",Overwatch,1526404302.0,t3_8jna9f
Let me hide my rank,"So, I'm in a unique situation here. I have severe health issues, to the point where I can't even sit at my computer and play OW most days, and this alongside rural internet. My internet is fine for gaming but it does require me to play when it's not being shared, usually at night.

I am a good player and I know this. Because of my health and internet severely limiting when I can play, especially this current season, I've had a terrible competitive career. I don't care what my SR and rank is, this isn't about where I'm placed. I know why my SR isn't as high as I feel it should be and so be it with these circumstances.

Despite this, I regularly get harassed and taunted over my rank in Quickplay games if I ever try to speak up with strategy or hero counters. I'm completely dismissed and laughed at because they can look up my rank and make assumptions.

Can we please have an option to hide our rank from non-friends? I get to play so little despite how badly I want to and it's really, -really- disheartening to be treated like garbage every time my body cooperates and I actually manage to play.

All I want is an option to hide my SR during non-comp games from non-friends. I'm tired of these strawman attacks.

Edit: So this turned into a whole thing? You guys are funny.",Overwatch,1497754349.0,t3_6hxh9n
Why was it neccesary to remove Cass flashbang and Brig stun going into 2 but they still don't have a problem with Ana Sleep (the strongest cc in the game)?,"It just doesn't belong in the game anymore. If Kiriko didn't exist then Ana would be the strongest hero in the entire game, Kiriko is LITERALLY the only thing keeping her in check, so if your supports refuse to play Kiriko you lose. The fact that she is the only non-tank with a stun and anti is absurd and there's a reason she's been the most picked character for forever now. She makes half the tanks unplayable and is the strongest counterpick character in the game by far. Why are the devs contempt with her having the 2 strongest squishy abilities in the game and being the only one who has them?",Overwatch,1700064781.0,t3_17vx1fx
Has Blizzard considered allowing beta testers to send invites? Might be good way to drum up community interest / hype.,"I was just thinking about this recently. Really it was more of a selfish thought because I was feeling bummed that I couldn't play OverWatch with my friends. I got an invite a while ago for the full beta access (not just the stress test weekend), and I have been SUPER into the game, it's got me more excited about gaming than anything in has several years (and I am a huge MGS fan!). But, alas, none of my playing buddies have a beta invite yet, so I cannot play with them. I really do wish I could get them in on the game, and I think that it would be very helpful for the community, and Blizzard themselves as well. Players are chomping at the bit to get to this game because of hype built up from streaming, and I'm confident I could get several people very into playing it very quickly.

I have finally done it: I have Understood the Matchmaker,"My friends, 

I wanted to tell this story on the battle.net forums and gave some information of how the matchmaker work. This thread was closed and I am now suspended from posting on the forums. They say that I cannot give away internal information. But what is strange is this my theory, many 100's of theory have been posted before, why am I suspended [*edit to clarify: I only mention small portion of my theory and ask if I should reveal the remainder before typing out because so long, I did not have in-depth explanation as I have here. This is when the thread was lock and moderator calls me troll and say ""**posting internal data not available through normal gameplay is against our Forum Code of Conduct.**""*]? I have not any internal information, I use my own data as others have but I have really figure it out in my opinion, maybe this is why they stop me, I cannot know.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

Please let me start off with apology for my English,  I know that some of what you are about to read is going to cause a ruckus in this place. People will be saying ""I cannot believe this to be true"" because they are in denial. Others already know this to be true. This long post is only for people with strong mind who want to understand the real way matchmaker work. I must disclaimer, this is my **theory** based on many seasons of data, observation, testing on multiple accounts and testing with friends. I am very good with numbers, I can solve any kind of code or puzzle and I have created a predictive model and it is now testing very accurately so this is why I believe I have figured this out. I can even predict most every game if it will be easy to win, fair game, or too difficult to win. What I am about to explain to you is how matchmaker work, there may be a few things that are different, it is inevitable that with something so complicated as this matchmaker that I got some small thing wrong. I cannot see the actual alogorithm and do not have every answer but what you are about to read is for the most part I believe correct, and some if you will be so shock you must lay down and stare at ceiling this make you so bewildered.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

**What I ask of each of you is this, read this entirely. Then go and play competitive and observe with your own mind, free from what you have been told. You will see that this is the truth.**
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

# **Let's begin:**

Most people believe that you can move up or down in rank depending on if you win or lose. This is in some way true, but what is more accurate to describe is to say that as you are playing Overwatch, the matchmaker is monitoring multiple variables in order to determine how good you are as a player and it uses this data to then FORCIBLY PUSH you to the rank it feels you deserve by giving you easy to win matches (if you are playing above your current rank), hard to win matches (if it feels you should lose some to get to the rank it feels you deserve), or fair matches if it feels you are your correct rank. With this in mind, let's begin:
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


Everyone knows this already but for those who do not:  
**SR = visible rank  
MMR = invisible rank that only matchmaker uses**  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

Now I will walk you through how matchmaking work by telling you a story that many are familiar with. This will make you see how matchmaker work:    
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

The matchmaking is constantly tracking everything you do, and comparing it to **how other people did who won or lost with that specific hero, on that specific map, playing offense or defense**.   
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp; 

SR will always go up or down depending on if you win, or lose. BUT  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp; 
**REMEMBER:** If you perform better than other people at your current rank, your MMR will go **up**, *regardless if you win or lose*.  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp; 
**REMEMBER:** If you perform worse than other people at your current rank then your MMR will go **down**, *regardless if you win or lose*.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

So here is an example of two players, I will call them Player A and Player B both start at:  
**SR = 3000**  
**MMR = 3000**
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


Player A won the game but did not do well when compared to other people at SR3000 who used the same hero, and won on the map they played. His end result is:  
**SR = 3020  
MMR = 2980**
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

Player B is in the same match and same team as Player A, won the game and did well when compared to other people at SR3000 who used the same hero, and won on the map they played. His end result is:  
**SR = 3020  
MMR = 3030**
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


Now it is important to inform you that **the matchmakers goal is to push people to the rank it believes they belong at based on how well they perform compared to other people**. Eventually (in theory) this will lead to fair matches. So, you could say that the matchmakers goal is to create fair matches, but it does this in a very different way than you can imagine.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

So person A joins the queue again. He notices that Player B, who was on his team last game, is now on the enemy team. The matchmakers job is to push people to the rank it believes they belong at (MMR) and so it purposely split these players up in a way that everyone on Person A's team has an MMR lower than their SR, and everyone on Person B's team has an MMR greater than their SR. Their ranks are similar, but the match is in favor of Player B's team. The other players that are on Player A's team are other people who have an MMR which is lower than their SR and the matchmaker believes they should be ranked down. The other players on Player B's team are people who have an MMR which is higher or the same as their SR and the matchmaker believes they should be ranked up, or stay at this rank.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

Continue with this example.

Player A plays and gets all gold medals but his team gets beaten. The result:  
**SR = 3000  
MMR = 3000**
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

Because he played well his MMR went up even though his SR went down. The matchmaker has done its job and now the SR and MMR converge. On his next game **Player A will receive a well balanced match, this is the fair match that the matchmaker has been designed to create.**
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  
**Let's follow Player A only now.**

Player A queues once again and plays this fair match, and they win but unfortunately he perform far below other people at this tier. But there was a reason.  His team asked him to focus on keeping the turret down by spamming with the Pharah. He did his job well, he kept the turret down and his team won because of this, but he did not get a lot of eliminations at all. He also did not do a lot of damage compared to other Pharah's at this tier who spam at the entire enemy team and he didn't get a good chance to make use of his ults (keep in mind matchmaker look at far more variables than eliminations and damage output as a deciding factor of whether MMR goes up or down). The matchmaker determines he is not really fit for this high of SR and the end result :  
**SR = 3015  
MMR = 2985**  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  
Because the matchmakers job is to make MMR converge with SR (in order to eventually create fair matches) he is now placed on a team that is unfavored to win. He plays, he loses. He gets all gold medals because his teammates were not good, [b] so he feels he played very well, and he did when compare to other players on his team, but because the other team was so much better he wasn't able to perform well when compared to the avg player[/b] who is usually in a fair match at this point, matchmaker think he doesn't belong at this tier so it lowers MMR.  End result:  

**SR = 2995  
MMR = 2975**  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

He queues again, matchmaker sees the SR still does not converge with MMR and places him on the team that is not favored to win in order to get him to the rank it feels is best suitable for him. Again, he get gold medals but because the other team is so much better he again cannot perform as well as other people in this tier.  The result:  

**SR = 2980  
MMR = 2965**  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

He is now on a loss streak. If he was placed into a fair match he could perform as well as other people in his tier and prove to matchmaker he belongs, but herein lies the problem with matchmaker. It is trying to get him to a rank appropriate for him, and in doing so is making it too difficult to perform well so his MMR keeps going down. He loses many more.  and the end result is:  

**SR = 2600  
MMR = 2580**  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

Now Player A queue again. Although he is placed on the team that is unfavored to win, he is now at a rank that is so far below what his actual skill is that he can perform at least what the avg person in this rank does despite the fact that he is favored to lose. He loses, but performed avg so the result is:  

**SR = 2580  
MMR = 2580**  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

Finally, his ranks have converged and he is given what the matchmaker erroneously perceives as a fair match. This is the fair match the matchmaker was designed to provide. Now that the teams are ""fair"" (i.e. his teammates are as capable as the other team) he can perform. But because of this loss streak he is far under his actual skill level, so he really shines. He gets all gold medals and demolishes the other team. He performs far above the avg person in this tier. End result:  

**SR = 2600  
MMR = 2620**  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

Player A queues again and is placed on the team favored to win. Not only is he on the team favored to win, but because of the loss streak he is at a tier far below where he should be. This is a steamroll. He outperforms the avg person in this tier by high margins because of this synergy.  

**SR = 2620  
MMR = 2650**  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

He receives a little MMR boost and gets placed again on the favored team and eventually this leads to a win streak and he is right back where he started.  

**SR = 3000  
MMR = 3000**  

Player A is now receiving fair and balanced matches. It will stay this way until he performs in a way that the matchmaker perceives as less, or better than his peers. Then the cycle will start again. Adversely, if he does something really good, then he will start to move up and this can snowball into a win streak and people will be at ranks they do not belong leading to confusion.  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  



# **THE BLIZZARD ANTI SMURF/BOOST ALGORITHM YOU DID NOT KNOW ABOUT**


I believe matchmaker has built in ""smurf"" and ""booster"" recognition. When  matchmaker recognizes that an account begin to play significantly better than it has in the past, it is flagged as an account that is possibly being boosted. It will be given  test game / gateway game that is difficult to win for someone at the current tier, but not for someone boosting. Example: a Top 500 player is boosting an SR 2200 account. The Top 500 player logs in to this 2200 SR account and suddenly this account begins to perform far beyond what it has before. Matchmaker recognizes this after a few games and at this time a gateway game is introduced that would be almost impossible for someone who has the skill of a 2200 to win, but a Top 500 could carry to victory. If this game is won then the account is flagged as being boosted. The purpose of this flag is to keep this top 500 smurf from ruining regular games. He will then be placed on the team with other players who are either currently marked as ""smurf accounts"" or placed with people who have an MMR that is significantly higher than their SR. So then who is on the other team that takes the punishment? I will get to this in a moment.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


So the smurf continues to play and get this 2200 SR account up to 3000 and then hands the account back to its original owner. The player logs into his newly boosted account and begins to play. Matchmaker is still giving easy games but recognizes that this person is to be performing significantly lower than what a rank 3000 should be, and also lower than his several previous games and it also sees that the account was flagged as boosted/smurf. If this player continues to perform significantly under what someone at rank 3000 should be performing, and less than his past several games, then the account will be flagged to rank down to the SR at which it was originally flagged as being boosted (probably around 2300). This player will now be placed in almost unwinnable matches. Who is on his team? Other people who are marked for downrank due to boosted accounts, and people who have a significantly lower MMR than their SR. These are the types people who the smurf/booster was playing against. The ideal scenario that Blizzard is trying to create is this: People who are purposely downranking their account to a low SR by throwing and playing bad so they can later use it to boost other accounts, will be marked for downrank and will be playing against accounts that are currently being used for boosting. So it will be throwers and purposeful downrankers against smurfs and boosted accounts. It places all of these toxic players in a match together to protect the general public from playing against/with these players. This is how it is supposed to work, and does work sometimes, and also has huge problems (I mean huge).
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


So here's the idea: You are separating smurfs/boosters and placing them all on one team and getting them to where they're going quickly, and the only peoples games they are ruining are people who were boosted themselves or are purposely downranking their account. This might even be a good idea on paper, but it is not working as they think it is. These streak triggers, boosted/smurf triggers, are being activated at times which they are not meant to. This is why you see the Blizzard forum boards innundated with people saying there is something wrong with matchmaker. People talking about loss streaks that are un-natural (of course streaks are natural, every person on planet know this). The problem is they are doing things that are productive but that the matchmaker sees as trolling or unproductuve, or troll/downranker/thrower actviity. Again, Pharah spamming a turret and getting a very low relative amount of kills and hero damage in a game can be very productive, but matchmaker may see this as unfavorable and if done enough times are placed into a downrank spiral.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


# **THE TAKE-AWAY**


Here is the big take-away: How well you perform in your current match and the several matches before it **compared to other people in the tier**, will determine if you get good or bad teammates in the next matches. Getting all gold medals just mean you did better than your teammates **in that game**, it does not necessarily mean you did better than people in your tier. So when you get 4 gold medals for a few games and then are placed on an obviously outmatched team, it means you are not performing as well as other people in your tier with the hero that you use in the past several matches. It may be that you are not satisfying one of the hidden performance metrics that Blizzard is monitoring (shot accuracy, damage TAKEN (as opposed to given), grouping with your teammates etc. and many others that are unknown to us. 
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

This has many problems, as we saw in the example,  once you are placed in match where you are favored to lose it is difficult to do well. The stats you are being compared with are mainly people who played in **fair matches**. Of course if you are placed in a fair match you will do better than someone who is placed in a match they are favored to lose. This creates a snowball effect. Now let me tell you how you can help avoid some of these problems. Never solo queue. Solo queue make it very easy for matchmaker to do its poorly designed job. When you are in a group, the more people that are with you the more difficulty it has splitting the teams. So if you played well in the previous games and your MMR has gone up, but your friend did not play well and his MMR went down, then it makes it more difficult for the matchmaker to push you to ranks. 
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

If you do solo queue and you are on win streak, keep playing back to back games. If you are playing and you are on a loss streak, it is important to queue dodge/cleanse (wait 5 min+ before queue again). Your MMR is lower than your SR, so you are being placed in games that are difficult to win. If you play with some of the same players from your last game it makes it easier for the matchmaker to know which players are better and worse than you are. If you queue dodge it will be less certain although you will still be placed in a match that is difficult to win, it has a better chance of being fair. If you are on  loss streak, your MMR may be signifcantly lower than your SR and it may take you 4-5 games to raise this to where you can get normal games. It will be very difficult because as I state, you are on a team of toddlers and playing against very good teams.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

The other problem is there are things that can be done in a match that are very beneficial but are not seen as productive by matchmaker. For instance, Pharah spamming a turret and getting low damage output and low kills. She helped win the game but was punished and the next game was placed to rank down.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


# **WHY DID BLIZZARD DO THIS?**

I do not have all the answers. I think they intentions are good to protect the general public from booster/thrower/deranker etc, and it works at some times but it has failed in some big way in others and caused so much confusion and frustration. We could also consider that they want to have control over what happens on their ladder.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  

# **HERE ARE QUESTIONS ASKED OFTEN WITH THE ANSWER:**

**Q: Why is it that the better I play the worse my teammates seem to be?**  
A: *This is very smart observation. There are two reason:   
1 Your account has been mark for de-rank and you are placed with horrible player that have low oxygen in brain so bad. They are so bad that you easily get 4 gold medals so this skew the pereception of how well you are doing. The next game you get the same thing over and over and constantly get all the gold medals and so it seems like you are getting bad teammates because you are playing well, when it is actually you are appearing to play better because your teammates are so bad.  
2  When matchmaker is trying to create fair game it matches you with people who are of similar rank, AND it looks at individual statistic in order to split the teams fairly. So let us say that it get 12 people together for a match. It will look at individual player statistic and find the best players and be sure that they are not on the same team. It will also find the worst and place them on different team. But this is not always the case. Sometimes it will place 6 people that are ""ok"" on the enemy team, and then give you 5 sub-par people because it see that you are so good you can carry enough to make it a fair match. This is terrible idea so bad make me sick. This mean that you must babysit all your games these bad players just in order to make it a fair match. You will feel like you are doing everything and yet not winning, only it being close match. A proper matchmaker would find 12 people who are the same SR/MMR and place them all on seperate teams randomly and assume they all are of equal skill since they are at same rank. Eventually the matchmaker would work itself out organically, not artifical as it currently is.*
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


**Q: If what you say is true then why is it that Blizzard has said that it only tries to create fair matches and nothing is rigged?**  
A: *In Blizzard mind they are creating fair matches. They are pushing players they seem as poor performers to their proper rank so they can receive a fair match. They are pushing better players to higher ranks so they can receive fair match. They have said they only create fair matches game after game because that is what they believe they are doing. The problem is HOW they are creating the fair matches, it is completely terrible like some smell you cannot get rid of. Also, they know if people understand how it work then they could manipulate it so of course they cannot describe this.*
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


**Q: I am playing extremely well, definitely far above my current tier and still get garbage teammate that play like some toddler. Why is this?**  
A: *You are probably very good and are missing some hidden performance metric that Blizzard like to see. Maybe not staying close enough to team. Maybe feeding too much even though you stay alive. You are doing something that the matchmaker erroneously believes is bad player.*
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


**Q: So you are saying that when I am marked for downrank it is impossible to win?**  
A: *No my friend, I am saying you have a much less chance of winning. If you happen to win this game you will get big MMR boost and maybe even immediately stop this downrank. Good luck, it will be very very hard. Only GM+ can do this or these cheater guy with aim assist.*  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  


**Q: So are people at their correct rank or not?**  
A: *Many are, many are not. This matchmaker system does work in some sense, but it has unforseen consequences that lead to people being at high or low ranks they do not deserve.*
  &nbsp;

**Q: Are you to say that this entire game is rigged?**  
A: *Yes and no. You still need to be skilled in order to hit the hidden performance metrics, so most people who are at high rank are there for good reason. Once you reach the rank matchmaker thinks you belong at, the games will be fair and not too rigged, but if you are on a loss or win streak then you are in completely rigged matches. This matchmaker is very complicated, many things are happening, it is not so fair to say the entire thing is rigged, more closer that it is like a child who has been hit in the face with board.*  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  
  

There is my theory, I have tested this and can now predict when I am put on loss streak and win streak and whether or not my next game will be easy or hard. When my next game will be won and when it will be lost before I even play it, not with 100% accuracy but most of the time. 
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp; 

Again, What I ask of each of you is this, read this entirely. Then go and play competitive and observe with your own mind, free from what you have been told. You will see that this is the truth. Please do not misunderstand the point of this thread, I love Overwatch and enjoy playing, I think Jeff can fix this, he is good man.

I compared the face of the female heroes from the overwatch 2 skins with the original ones. This is the result.,,Overwatch,1656476599.0,t3_vn6ubj
The other one annoyed me so I made my own LORE power level tier list (not gameplay)! Detailed justification in the comments,,Overwatch,1647249737.0,t3_tdtenb
The importance of designing heroes with passive value: Why people love Reinhardt and Lucio but hate Kiriko and Ana.,"So lets start by defining what ""passive value"" actually is. Passive value is value that a character gets simply by existing whilst doing other things. An example of this could be Brig's inspire, Reinhardt's ability to demand space, or Lucio's auras. You don't nessecarily have to do anything to get passive value, it's usually something innate that's given to a character without requiring them to do anything whilst also not taking away autonomy. Usually passive value isn't something that you need to choose to do, EX: Lucio can still shoot, move, and do whatever he really wants mostly freely, hence making his auras passive, where-as Mercy must commit to one of her beams and a target which significantly limits her ability of choice.

&#x200B;

I think we can even split passive value down into even neater definitions: Abstract and concreate passive value. 

* Concreate - Brig's inspire, Illari's turret healing, Symmetra's turret sonar. Things that can generally be measured or directly observed. 
* Abstract - Illari's ability to create safer off angles, Brig's ability to create safe zones for her and her support, Pharah's ability to force attention up and away from the rest of her team, Tracers ability to force supports attention away from supports and onto her while also being very good at forcing supports to expend cooldowns, Mercy's ability to distract enemies while still providing full value. Things that cannot be directly measured or observed. 

&#x200B;

In general, heroes with a lot of passive value actually tend to be preferred by the playerbase. Lucio, Reinhardt, Brig, Tracer, and Sigma all have a lot of passive value, and they're all generally not very hated by the playerbase. Of course these heroes have had controversies in the past... brig, but in general, currently, no one really strongly dislikes these heroes. 

&#x200B;

Now let's look at heroes with very little passive value, or in other words, heroes with a lot of active value: Doomfist, Kiriko, Ana, Widowmaker. Generally all of these heroes have a lot of value that is only available when utilized, and value that usually comes at a high opportunity cost. Doomfist provides essentially zero protection for his team but has significantly powerful mobility, burst, and CC. Kirko is one of the only supports without any ""concurrent"" abilities (abilities that can provide value while she's doing something else, EX: bap can regen burst and passivley heal while still DPS'ing) but she has a lot of high burst impact, like hitting a headshot, cleansing an ally, or TP'ing out of a fight. Ana has a lot of abilities with high opporituinity cost, but all with SIGINIFICANT power when hit. Widowmaker is kinda weird because IMO she has a lot of both passive and active value, it's just that it all comes at an extremely high cost due to her low damage potential and overall room for error, that being said her passive value (her ability to put pressure on very large sightlines from very long ranges) is a result of her active value (her oneshot). 

&#x200B;

Heroes with a lot of active value, even when they're statistically weak, still FEEL very powerful because it always feels like they have an advantage in a 1v1 scenario. The hero ON THEIR OWN feels very very powerful at the sacrifice of less power for their team.

&#x200B;

Let's think of a team of heroes as all contributing a % of value to their team. In a boring world every hero provides 20% value and that's it. In Overwatch a hero like Lucio might provide 12% value, but gives each teammate an additional 2% through his auras. When you add everyones value together you still get 100% even though Lucio on his own is lower. A hero like Kiriko might provide like 18% value, and give .5% value to each teammate. Kiriko is still just as powerful as Lucio, but more of her power budget is allocated to herself. This makes her ALONE feel much much more powerful than Lucio even though they're still providing the same amount of value. 

&#x200B;

In general this is going to make a hero like Kiri FEEL overpowered because all of her value LOOKS like it comes for her and makes her much more observably powerful. It's a lot easier to notice a Kiriko hitting a headshot and 2-tapping you than it is to notice a Lucio providing his entire team with a crucial 40% speed boost. 

&#x200B;

Passive value FEELS more consistent to play against and feels more predictable. Getting unpredictably oneshot by a widowmaker feels unfair because it's sudden and you didn't expect it. Having to play around a Reinhardts area of influence feels a lot more fair because even though he's having a similar level of impact as the Widow who killed you, you still feel like you're in control. Reinhardt feels predictable and the power feels like it's in your hands, ""as long as \*\*I\*\* don't misplay \*\*I\*\* don't get punished."" 

&#x200B;

I think from a ""playing as"" standpoint heroes with a lot of passive value are also just as if not sometimes more popular than heroes without active value. Lucio, Reinhardt, Mercy, and Genji are all quite popular and heroes who have a lot of passive value. Kiriko, Ana, and Doomfist are also quite popular, but we all see where complaints are directed.

Can we give credit to Blizzard,"Because of their awesome inclusiveness!  I'm a Japanese male, and am happy to see a few represenatives in the game!  We also have multiple females characters, and outside of the Widowmaker, all aren't overly sexualized, and have reasonable body proportions

I enjoy that not every female character has to look like Lara Croft - even if Donald Drumpf would like it like that.  Zarya is a beautiful person, and while not conventionally attractive, she's strong with a sense of duty.  I like that.  Same with Moira; not an attractive character, but is exceedingly smart and driven

The males are portrayed in a way that makes me happy too.  Genji/Hazno are obviously in great shape, but we also have an older guy in Soldier: 76, and a alternative lifestyle choice in Roadhog - don't call him fat, that's mean, it's his choice!

All in all, I'm happy that Blizzard doesn't portray all the male and female characters as sexed-up, but as strong characters.  Thank you Blizzard! ",Overwatch,1534648542.0,t3_98hbs4
Can we admit Genji is easy to play yet?,"I was never vehement about the Genji nerf, so this isn't a Genji is OP thread. But the cult that his developed around his skill level is ridiculous. 

I understand that Genji is picked constantly in the pro's, in high elo, and I constantly see him picked at high levels. But after recently playing with a friends who just bought the game, I can honestly  say that he is constantly spammed even at sub 40 levels! While the difference in skill level is obvious, Genji continues to be a solid pick even for beginners. It has gotten to a point that I am just recommending Genji to my friends that never played shooters. Yet all I keep hearing from reddit is about how ""hard"" he is to play. 

Lets look at it another way. Most champions that are considered moderately hard to play have definite reasons why. Widowmaker and to a lesser extent McCREE require good aim and fast reaction time. Genji doesn't really require either, at least no more than any other champ in the game. Other heroes have marked disadvantages that require skill to be overcome. Tracer has the lowest life total in the game requiring good positioning and reaction time. Ana has no mobility and her dmg and heal are her basic atk. Requiring you to hit all your shots/sleep darts for defense. 

So what are Gemji's weaknesses? He is one of the most mobile champions in the game, has the second best defensive ability after rein shield, has an ult that can get multiple kills with no set up, and so on. He does require positioning and getting the hang of his combo. But honestly his kit is just super solid. I don't think he is OP in the least but I haven't come up with any reason to think he is hard to play and the fact he is spammed in low levels further proves this. 

TLDR:  After seeing Genji constantly spammed in sub level 40, I can no longer think of a reason as to why people actually think he is hard to play.  NO I AM NOT SAYING GENJI NEEDS A NERF.",Overwatch,1472412027.0,t3_500xb7

Blizzard Screwed Me Over,"All I wanted this Halloween was that Witch Mercy skin.

I buy some crates.
20 crates.
No Witch Mercy; but I'm at 2500 credits.
Buy 10 more crates.

I click the skin.
I click unlock.
And I click it again.
And again.

I bought crates, but couldn't craft the skin.
I cried.

In all seriousness pretty sure this counts as false advertisement somehow.

TL;DR Blizzard stopped the event early, but still let you buy crates, so I got screwed over and couldn't craft the skin I wanted, the only reason I bought crates.

Sorry about the format.

Blizzard's tendency to overnerf/overbuff is a serious problem with Overwatch moving forward,"So we all remember when McCree was nerfed into the ground with FTH, then buffed into God tier with left click range buff, then slightly reduced.

Mercy was overnerfed with her ult charge increase and is now clearly a suboptimal pick in comparison to Lucio/Zen (think she may take Lucio's place now w/ the PTR changes)

Widowmaker was nerfed into the ground with her scope charge nerfs and has yet to recover (outside of that like one pro guy who is just incredibly gifted with aiming)

Genji has just been overnerfed by getting rid of his main strength, his mobility, on the PTR. He will now be trash tier DPS (and before you say this is an overreaction, come look back at this post in a week and tell me I'm wrong)

What I'm getting at with all this is that Blizzard needs to find a happy middle ground with these balance changes. They have got to stop looking at people bitching in pubs about X character and have kneejerk reactions to the heroes.

I think this leads to a very erratic gameplay experience overall as Overwatch is already turning into a ""Flavor of the Month"" type of game that made me leave WoW's PvP. You're about to see a lot more Tracer/McCree or Tracer/Hanzo type of setups in the coming weeks.",Overwatch,1471459854.0,t3_4y7e1a
[Serious] A puntition to Blizzard regarding the Olympic skins,"Blizzard, please have Mercy on us. I don't want to hear your Zen-yadda-yadda-yadda, I just want you to McAgree with us. We're not being D.Va's here, we're just excited about the skins and what Mei be the standard being set for future skins. I don't Ana be a downer here but my Rein-heart tells me that I must speak up.

I wasn't Torbjörn this way, in fact, my willingness to speak up can be Tracered back to when I was a Soldier in '76. I know what it's like to fight for what you believe in, and it's true what they say, you Reaper what you sow. I really am not here to Bastion you, Blizzard, I'm a huge fan of the game. We've all had some Hans and Zos over the course of this game, but this would be a new low to not only time limit the loot, but to also prevent it's purchase through in-game currency. Frankly, it Luci-blows. When I first heard the news, I said ""Genji-sus Christ! How can they be such greedy hogs... Roadhogs!""

I asked a friend if it was true.

""Yep, I hoarded all my coins like a Junkrat but for what? Now I just have all these coins. Guess I'll buy something for Widowmaker, even though her skins all suck.""

I’m so sick of the “We want 6v6 back” posts,"Nobody cares. It’s not going to happen, blizzard wanted to move in a new direction and won’t ever bring back 6v6. Get over it. If you don’t like the game then just play something else.

Overwatch is my favorite franchise of all time. I put more hours in ow1 then any game ever before, and guess what, 5v5 was the best thing that ever happened to overwatch.

6v6 devolved into supports being forced to heal bot and babysit two tanks. Dps were forced into shooting shields. Tanks were forced to get chain CC’d every single match. 5v5 made the game better, and I’ll list every reason why.

1. Flow: the flow of the game is much better and more focused with only one tank. It’s more straight forward and less being stuck at choke points because no one can get past two tanks.

2. Less CC: CC in overwatch 1 was garbage, for both the player using it and the player going against it. Even though brig needs some slight buffs, I still have tremendously more fun playing brig now then I ever did in overwatch 1.

3. Passives: specifically the support passive. As a support main, I absolutely love how much more self reliance I have without needing a second support to heal me up all the time.

4. More personal responsibility: I have more power to affect the outcome of games, and I love that.

5. Tanking is fun: i get to be the some leader of the team and actually have the power to do more then shield and hold choke points.

6. It’s easier to win fights down 1. Don’t come out with the dumb math argument of “5v6 is statistically better then 4v5.” It doesn’t work like that at all in a game based around roles and abilities.

There’s more I could list but these are the main ones I can think of.",Overwatch,1674152453.0,t3_10g8yli
"Blizzard said they talk to pros when balancing their game, yet every pro says ressurect should be gone","...and imo they're right.

Countering skillful play with a single button press with almost no risk but full reward always fails in the long run. 
I'm thankful that Blizzard is virtually removing the ress during her ultimate, but that will not fix the point made above. Right know i have the feeling we have a long way to go with Mercy and finally, at the end of 2018 / early 2019, ressurect will be removed and another more balanced ability will take it's place. 

And yes, i mostly play Mercy and i hate ressurect. I stopped playing her, dropping out of masters and learning non-support heroes and having the time of my life.

This sub is one of most doomer gaming subs I’ve ever seen in my life,"Don’t get me wrong, I can hardly blame people for having low expectations and being upset. Blizzard is pretty consistently disappointing in a number of ways. However, I think we need to add a healthy dose of patience and reality check. We don’t know very much yet.

Here’s what we do know. Overwatch was not originally planned to be a “forever game” that gets upkeep and new content. They came in right before this new model of F2P + battle pass  + cosmetics shook the whole online gaming industry. 

I believe that this tension between the old way and the new way is the core issue they had to resolve which caused them to bungle overwatch 2 communication for a long time, most likely scrap a lot of work, and most likely restart with a new direction within the last year. All the while overwatch 1 has been losing players, especially big name community members, and drying up on content with lots of people complaining about staleness, balance, etc.

I know it feels bad to pay box price for a game and then have it changed or taken away. I know it feels unfair, but let’s just look at it objectively 60 bucks at its peak, 40 for the majority of the lifetime of the game, very often on sale for 10-20 bucks, and we all got 5 years of server uptime, new characters, skins, maps, development, bug fixes, balance changes. You really can’t believe that’s sustainable without signing up new players right? Even in the old days there would be a more than one new Halo or CoD within that time frame. Yes it is gross. Yes it will be abusing gaming addicts, using dopamine cycles to create more, and trying to milk whales for all of their income. I too am disappointed to hear the new hero is not unlocked by default, and I too am disappointed by blizzard’s slow trickle of information.

But this is just gaming under capitalism, what did you expect? If your product is a luxury like any game is, then you have to compete or die on your principles. And they have been getting crushed by Fortnite, Apex, LoL, R6, and everyone else when they have way better art, characters, and (during the good times) better gameplay than all of them. I can at least appreciate that some people are trying to resuscitate this dying franchise so that they can keep working on it and we can keep playing it. Blizzard is not some special greedy evil company, they are just as bad as everyone else and unless you’re advocating for systemic change then you really have no reason to expect anything other than profit chasing with some fan service. We are lucky gaming is still an industry where quality and fun of a game affect how much money they make. 

Maybe I am just naively hopeful, maybe I am a blizzard shill, maybe the game will just die and they fucked it up already too far to fix it. I don’t know. But can we please save the blind conjecture and worst case assumptions for ourselves, or at least admit them to be not based in any facts? We don’t know how fair the reward systems will be. We don’t know how the game will feel or be balanced. We don’t know what metas will form or how the game will work in the next year. And for anyone thinking you’re going to lose because your team doesn’t have all the heroes unlocked, get to GM and then you can complain about that, because that’s when it might actually be true sometimes. 

Anyways, I just had to rant because this community, all the bullshit and entitlement, and all the flat out lies and misconceptions that I see floating around here just completely ruin any chance of actually discussing the game, or having any excitement.

Free to play has officially ruined Overwatch,"I have been playing OW since 2016 and I think I have finally hit my limit and this game is being flushed. I don't care about the bugs, the store content or prices, or ANY of the stupid casual criticisms players make in these threads.

I care about competitive and sadly this game is becoming less competitive and more casual every single day. I'm sick and tired of joining ranked matches with obvious broken matchmaking, players that rage quit and leave and ruin the climb and experience for other players.

The community was already trash. There isn't a middle ground. Players in this community are either overly offensive and toxic, or act as Blizzard's social justice Gestapo by reporting everyone for every little offense. Nobody can just play the fucking game anymore. 

The toxic players rage quit which penalizes their team if anyone else chooses to leave due to the disadvantage. In most circumstances the player leaves because of their own bad performance or from having terrible support players on their team.

The social justice Gestapo mainly play support and they will easily throw or not heal dependent on the level of how toxic the teams transgressions in chat were. 

It's bullshit and I'm fucking tired of it. It's a safe realization that it isn't that blizzard doesn't care about Overwatch anymore, it's that they opened the door for millions of players in order to capitalize like fortnite etc, that have no vested interest in the game and just add to the issues this game community already had.

OW2 is a downgrade by every metric,"Been playing this game since launch so I’ve been witness to the many shapes OW has taken over the years. Most of these changes were jarring at the time but quickly went on to improve some aspect of the game. Now we have this anti-consumer battle pass centered experience masquerading around as a sequel which has extinguished any/all the love I’ve had for this game.

- 5v5 is trash, battles are now asymmetrical team fights with unbalanced tanks and a shitty support experience 

- the years of no new content is slowly being trickled in by locking new characters behind this bullshit battle pass, really??

- shitty new game mode is forced down our throats while maps with actual personality are seemingly removed forever 

- the communication from development is abysmal and blizzard should be embarrassed how they’re handling updates/bug dices. Wasn’t the point of this game model to make balance patches more frequent?

- without loot boxes/a way to earn cosmetics without literally paying for them, there’s almost 0 reason to even play this game anymore

- I guarantee this frequently promised pve experience is going to be a reskinned version of the crappy new Halloween even this year which most would agree was disappointing to say the least

All this for 3+ years of development? OW 1 with multiple years of no new content was infinitely better than this sorry excuse of a game we have now. Judging by the state of the sub, people overwhelming agree with this sentiment and blizzards response is to plug their ears and continue to spew out shit.

It's very useful and almost essential for most comps but IMO it is also the most boring way to play this game. Overwatch is all about a crazy assortment of heroes with different powers and abilities going head to head with each other. When you require a Reinhardt on your team though you're essentially asking that person to stand there and be a wall, not a hero.

As I like to try and fill in the gaps within my team I usually end up playing reinhardt, and get bored. When my teammates can't quite push through I end up mostly standing there unable to do more other than shield. If a Tracer or genji flanks me I then end up trying to kill them and in turn get my team killed because I stop shielding or I keep shielding and watch my health drain because nobody is killing the flanker... 

Don't get me wrong, playing as Reinhardt is Very fun when you aren't shielding. Charging people and going ham with your hammer is great. But most of the time you're expected to stand there with your shield out so that others can play the game. 

Now I know that people like being Reinhardt because he contributes so much to the team. But the other tanks except roadhog all have ways of protecting others without you having to stand there letting them do all the work. Winston drops his barrier and then carries on. Zarya can protect herself and another person but has to target them. Her damage output is also tied to her shields so there's a skill in using them effectively. DVAs is very similar to reinhardt I'll admit but she can still move fast and fly which makes her more interesting to play. It's also on a resource meter so she can't stand there like reinhardt, she has to either run or attack after a few seconds preventing her from being utilized as another wall. 

Symmetra has a way of shielding teammates like Reinhardt but is also able to move and shoot while doing it. Mei can wall other players off to protect teammates and can use her wall to also get around the map. 

Reinhardt however can only raise his shield or attack and when it's raised he moves slowly. Unlike the others you will never see a reinhardt use his shield and think ""Wow that was an amazing save"" or ""I never thought of using his shield like that before!"" because it can't do anything else. Unfortunately it is one of the most useful abilities in the game. If the enemy team has a reainhardt and you don't you have a big disadvantage. If you have a reinhardt and they don't then you have the advantage and so both teams usually end up with a reinhardt simply because you need him to counter theirs. 

I don't have any suggestions to improve this though and it feels so necessary to the game that I doubt much will change with it. However I feel the need to mention this because I don't want any future heroes to end up with a similar ability.

I would love it if Blizzard were able to make his shield ability a bit more active and skill based so that I don't just have to stand there watching other people play the game while I protect them",Overwatch,1488297549.0,t3_5worwb

Buying the overly expensive OWL skins doesn't make me feel like a supporting fan. It makes me feel like a whale who got scammed,"With all of the defensive posts on the front page, I'll probably be downvoted. But I still thought it was necessary to explain the other side of the argument.

&nbsp;

First off, the price is simply absurd. No game I know charges this much money ($5) for a simple recolor for a skin. I've heard league of legends does this, but **league of legends is a free to play game with no paid dlc**, so it seems reasonable that they would overcharge on cosmetic skins. In fact, most other games charge $5 or less for actual characters with unique abilities and amazing designs (injustice, super smash bros wii u, etc).

&nbsp;

**Buying a $0.50 digital skin for 10 times the price doesn't feel like supporting a team, it feels like getting scammed. You can call me entitled, you can call me spoiled, but this is the way I perceive things.** Likewise, seeing someone with multiple Outlaws skins doesn't make me think: ""wow, he must like the outlaws,"" it makes me think ""wow, someone actually paid that much for recolors...""

&nbsp;

**This whole situation is similar to the first OW summer games event, where the event skins weren't purchasable and were only obtained through loot boxes.** Back then people were claiming: ""Oh, but buying loot boxes is meant to support Blizzard"" and ""It's only cosmetics, it's totally optional"" (just like now). But everyone, including Blizzard, agreed that taking the customer friendly option was best for the long run. Unless OWL is meant to only last for a few weeks, they should lower the price a bit.

&nbsp;

Finally, even though people get access to one of the over 300 skins, it feels as if OWL is only meant to be enjoyed by the whales in OW whereas it should be enjoyed by the entire OW crowd base. What if I want to support more than 1 team? What if I change my alliances later on? What if I simply like multiple skins? Should I be expected to pay more than the base game itself to enjoy these options?

&nbsp;

**I wouldn't mind paying $1 for each skin, or paying/grinding for OWL specific loot boxes.** But as it stands now, my friends and I are gonna be abstaining from supporting teams via skins",Overwatch,1515545541.0,t3_7pbuip
"A Few Tips From A Rank 42, Now Rank 71","Hey fellow redditers, I just wanted to give everyone a few tips that are different from what a lot of other people are saying right now. These are things that helped me on my long journey from the lowly rank 42 to now rank 71.

WARNING: The word ""fuck"" will be used many times.

1. DON'T FUCKING ARGUE WITH ANYONE

I can't stress this enough, but fucking grow up and play the fucking game. ""But OP, fuck face edgy teenager over here is the shittiest fucking Reaper I've ever played with and he says he fucked my mom!"" Well random Reddit user, I say to you: ""Who the fuck cares?"" Get the fuck over it, you will get absolutely nowhere arguing with people in game. Best case scenario you lose the game and fucking derank. Ignore people that try to argue and concentrate on working with the competent people on your team instead of the fucking dumbass. Most of the time he'll realize that he does in fact want to win and will eventually work with the team. If he doesn't, fuck it. It's one game.

2. LEARN TO PLAY MORE THAN ONE FUCKING HERO

Playing one hero might work. But more often than not, it won't. Here's why. In this fuckfest of a game, most matches (competitive not professional) are won by playing countering heroes. If the have a fuckboy Bastion, someone needs to play something like Genji to deal with him before he bends your team over and inserts his fucking machine gun into your asses and shoots until your a steaming pile of shit. You'll also never understand certain characters and roles until you play them. I started playing a fuckton better when I started playing tank because as a DPS main I never understood positioning until I was trying to protect my own DPS teammates from the Junkrat and his 'fuck you up' spam balls. Just like when you heal, sometimes you have to follow your DPS into a fight to not only continue to heal them but also utilize the damage side or your skills.

3. DON'T BE A BITCH ABOUT CRITICISM

Stop fucking crying when someone says something to you about what you're doing wrong. You're not a perfect player. ""Neither is he/she OP! And I'm right!"" You might be right, they might be wrong, but acknowledge their point and move on. I'm going to use something that Steel tweeted out that I think more people need to see:

""Identifying reasons why you're losing and offering solutions isn't blame, it's analysis. Don't be so sensitive, it's not a personal attack.""

He hits that right on the fuckinrg head. Learn to take criticism. I'm not trying to say listen to everything, I'm trying to say be open to everything and take what you hear and decide what would be best.

4. YOU BELONG WHEREVER THE FUCK YOU ARE

The ranking system isn't perfect, but it does a good job about keeping you near where you belong. When I was a rank 42 I belonged there because I played like a fucking dumbass and didn't listen to people/strats that my team was trying to execute. I only cared about shitting on as many fuckboys as I could, which consisted of me playing Hanzo and Tracer every game. Granted, my Tracer play actually ended up helping me climb through the 50s and into the high 60s, I learned how to play in coordination with my team. Evaluate where you and and realize where you're fucking up at.

5. IT TAKES FUCKING TIME

It takes time to be able to play a lot of heroes at a good level. Don't go into a game expecting to fuck everyone up the first time you play Genji. Shit, I'm still trying to learn to swing the fucking sword. Practice, practice, and fucking practice.

6. STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR SHITTY FUCKFACE FRIENDS

I know, I know. Friendship matters, but if you are trying not to take this game seriously, keep the group play in quick play. I have some friends that I love to play with, but there's one problem. They fucking suck. So, I don't play competitive with them. If it's that big of a deal, then be prepared to play for a really long time to improve as a group because I guarantee you'll all improve at different rates.

Overall, just try to be an intelligent fucking human and learn from your mistakes. Spend time thinking about your games afterwards before you start the next one and learn from them.

Thanks for reading.

Why 5v5 Might Actually Be Good For The Game,"Hear me out here. There are definitely downsides to 5v5, such as OWL players being fired and no more rein zarya/ball monkey/orisa hog. But there are a lot of upsides to this that will make the game more balanced and bring queue times back (hopefully).

First, they've mentioned that they're bringing CC down, and tanks' role passives may also reduce CC duration. Even though current Rein can barely bring his shield down to sneeze nowadays before McCunt has flash fanned him, in OW2 he'll be more tanky to compensate.

Map design in OW2 seems catered to this 5v5 play, as teams are now less reliant on tanks to get through chokes (which allows the play of non-barrier tanks). There is more cover, which reduces reliance on barriers that we currently have due to the shit map design in OW. There also seem to be way more flanks, which allow dps to take picks easier.

Also, the game will be way more balanced. Current OW balance is dominated by the developers' fear of buffing tanks, otherwise they will bring on another meta that everyone hates. If you buff hog, welcome back to double shield everyone! If you buff sigma, guess what, double shield! If Orisa, then welcome back to double shield! This removes that fear of tank synergies being too OP and allows the team to balance the tanks on their own merits and not just their synergy with another tank. Orisa is a great example of this, a character forced to be dogshit because if she is good, she forces an Orisa meta, purely because she plays so well with Sigma and Hog. Now, Orisa can be allowed to be good again.

The balance system will be so much more straightforward now too. If there is a Rein meta, then nerf Rein. If there is a hog meta, then nerf hog. If there is a double shield meta in OW, it is hard to nerf anything without making one of the tanks useless by themselves but strong with the other tank, further necessitating that those two tanks always be run together. This is no longer an issue.

Ans finally, queue times. There is one tank less player to have to find now, which makes queues faster. But the main saving grace will be that tanks will be superbuffed to compensate for the lack of off tank, and they will be fun as fuck to play. Winston is getting a long range lightning bolt, which sounds pretty nice, and Rein gets 2 firestrikes plus a better charge, and god knows what the other tanks will get. Also remember that Rein will be one of the least buffed out of all of the tanks because he has a good shield already, so we should see some wacky stuff on the other tanks. The tank role will be allowed to be actually fun again.

Overwatch is the best team game on the market right now.,"Look, I get the first season of competitive play maybe has not met expectations but I fully believe Blizzard will improve upon it for seasons to come. A year from now, when Season 5 starts, we'll look back at Season 1 and laugh about how ridiculous it was.

No other game right now is offering such deep team gameplay with so much potential. Blizzard is in constant communication on their forums about this game showing how dedicated they are to this game.

The strategy is immense, the lore is beautiful, and most importantly... the game play is phenomenal. I challenge anyone to say a major popular team game that is better than Overwatch right now. CS:GO isn't, League of Legends isn't, DOTA isn't.

Microtransactions are limited, everything is unlockable for free - skins, poses, icons, voice lines. It's all there for you right away, you got what you paid for.

Thank you Blizzard so much for this game, I'm so excited to go on this journey with you and the community. I am sorry for my disappointing English, I just really wanted to express my gratitude and excitement to git gud at this game through the years.

Edit: Sorry I didn't mean to upset someone, when I said name a game better than Overwatch right now because League of Legends DOTA and CSGO aren't what I meant was in total not just strategy.

"As a DPS main, thank you blizzard","I mean seriously, you guys have catered to us so much it's ridiculous. First we were having trouble with roadhog since we couldn't bother to learn how to position, so what did you do? You gutted anything resembling offensive prowess, so we would be able to focus on our RAW MECHANICS(after all, that's the only thing that matters right?)

But that's not all. Even though we DPS mains were already blessed by papa jeffs hand enough, we wanted more. Granted, this was rather greedy of us but you still listened! You gutted Dva too, and now nothing can stop us from showing off our skill honed from years of nothing but Call of Duty.

And this most recent time we didn't even have to ask! There was a bug with lucio that made him slower, which I personally thought should go to live (after all, not being able to hit something because it moves so much is anti fun, amirite?) but it was announced a bug, so I let it go. YET YOU STILL BLESSED US. You let this KNOWN BUG go to live without even touching it, so now the only thing that can fight us DPS mains are the only other players with ACTUAL skill, other DPS mains! This is truly going down in history as one of the best moments in overwatch history

And let's not even forget the mercy nerfs coming soon! Overwatch will truly be a skillful game once we don't have to worry about tanks or healers, though I must say, symmetra is pretty overpowered. Maybe she should be nerfed next...

I'm happy that the beta is failing on Twitch.,"Currently, Overwatch is at 3,000 views behind Creative, Madden and Minecraft. Personally, I think this is a great thing as obviously Blizzards intentions were to hand the beta out to popular streamers and have Overwatch hype built through people clicking on the icon from the Twitch home page. Now, people only play Overwatch whilst in queue for League games or when the odd popular streamer decides to play it from time to time. Am I the only one that thinks this is great? Us fans who have signed up and waited since day 1 were put aside by Blizzard and now it's 'backfiring' (Probably not the right word) on them hard. I hope you guys realise after this that making a closed beta this limited it generates near to no hype and that people that have watched the game closely and desperately want to play it will be more loyal towards the game unlike the personalities you decided to give it over to.

The Mercy Nerf Is Not A Massive Nerf,"Maybe I'm just missing something incredibly obvious, but the changes to Valkyrie seems very minor to me (and don't even tackle the main problem, imo).  They're acting like Blizzard made her completely useless.

Yeah, they removed the rez reset and removed the lower cooldown, but look at everything else about Valkyrie still in effect.

- She can fly, allowing her to move in any axis very quickly (in addition to her tiny hitbox), making her hard to kill and allowing her much better positioning.
- She constantly regenerates health, making her even more difficult to kill.
- Her gun has infinite ammo and increased projectile speed.
- She can heal and damage buff multiple players at once (and at a further distance).
- She can do all that for 20 seconds (which dwarfs the time allowed by most ultimates).

Together, these still make her ult very powerful. Just because she can't undo team deaths at a rapid pace anymore, that doesn't make her useless. Valkyrie's purpose is now similar to that of sound barrier and transcendence: sustainability. Mercy is more than just her rez ability now, so stop acting like she's not worth playing. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if she gets nerfed a little more in the no so distant future.",Overwatch,1507213988.0,t3_74gbyc
Cringe Voiceline,,Overwatch,1668035858.0,t3_yqyr4b
Lots of words about why Genji isn't OP,"To start off, I figured I'll post my personal Overwatch ""prowess"" since I'm sure many people who are already ready to flame this post before they even read it, would be curious as to what perspective this is coming from:

- I've had OW since release, around 300 hours currently played.

- Rank ~62 in competitive, most played heroes are McCree, Tracer, Roadhog, and Lucio. So no, I'm not a salty Genji 1 trick.

- I watch OW tournaments whenever LCS isn't on. aka a lot.

So this post is coming from a perspective of someone who is a relatively average player overall, and enjoys watching the game quite a bit.

One the most discussed topics in the community currently, is the state of Genji, saying he may be too overpowered/has too much of an impact on the game, as we can see here for example:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4whkll/is_genji_ruining_ow_esports_at_the_moment/

The first time I heard about this, I thought it was probably just a random thread that most likely wouldn't garner a lot of support, but I come back later to find it's the top topic on a lot of streams/reddit. 

I'm going to cite specific claims, give credit to the submitter, and provide my counterargument to them, I'm doing it this way because I think it's the ""cleanest"" way to do it.

The few claims that drew the most support are the following:

"" Problem is Genji is the character with the highest skill ceiling in OW. In the hands of noobs he's near useless but at the upper levels of CP he can shred an entire team. "" - from /u/nishaan26

- I disagree with the idea that as the skill gets higher, Genji becomes harder to deal with. At high CP(from what I've watched on streams) Genji is extremely easy to deal with. Most comps run Lucio/Zen, and all you have to do is click either ult when Genji goes in with his ult, and his entire ult is mitigated. Now past his ult, lets analyze his back-line harass, which is another area of complaint. Simply put, a good McCree can keep a Genji off the back-line, heck even a half way decent McCree can keep a good Genji off. Mei, Winston, Zarya, and even a solid Tracer or 76, all also have the capability of dealing with Genji to an extent. This is called counter-play, having to pick a hero to counter-play another hero, is part of a team game, it doesn't mean a specific hero needs a nerf. Pharah is considered unplayable at high level because the McCree counter-play is too strong, should Pharah get buffed because of this, or should McCree get nerfed because of it? Probably neither. 

People say to this ""Genji requires MORE counter-play then other heroes, which is why he's overpowered."" I think this is an invalid point honestly. 1 Lucio/Zen ult can counter his ult, and 1 McCree can counter his harrass. Sure that's 2 heroes to deal with 1 you might say? Let's just keep in mind though, Zen, Lucio, and McCree all have kits that allow them to counter Genji easily, AND put in work on the rest of the team. So it's not a 2:1 trade as seems to be advertised. Each hero brings much more to the table then JUST countering Genji.

"" Genji should not be able to reflect during his ult "" - from /u/asouthernlove

- I disagree with this, you waste 25% of your ult if you choose to deflect in it. That's already eliminating a massive amount of cleanup potential, and therefore is a fair tradeoff in my opinion. Also, if you need to reflect during your ult, most of the time the cleanup potential is already gone.

"" They could also re-adjust Genji's health. "" - from /u/WLBH

- 150 health is the number this post was centered around. I believe they tried Genji at 150 health in the past, and it was unplayable, a lot of people said that WAS because of Widow, but now that shes nerfed you can nerf Genji. As it stands, Tracer(and little DVA if you're being cheeky) is the only sub 200hp hero in the game. Tracer has immaculate elusiveness and a recall that restores her to full hp. There's a reason shes the only one with 150 hp, it's simply too low to be viable unless you can be totally untouchable. Although Genji is very elusive, he can be reeled in with a lot more ease then Tracer, hence why I think 200hp is fine.

"" A lot of the complaints of Genji are based on Ana. Good coordination and communication is not a counter to a Nano boosted Genji. ""  from /u/rowdy2009

- ""Good coordination and communication is not a counter to a Nano boosted Genji"". That's a really bold statement, let's think about this. Nano boost + Blade, 2 ults. Transcendence or Sound Barrier, 1 ult, along with a team effort to shutdown the Genji. Completely mitigates/OVER mitigates the Ana/Genji combo. I understand Genji/Ana hurts A LOT, but to imply it has little to no counterplay is wrong.

Let's also consider win rates very quickly, just because in the end, statistics do matter:

http://masteroverwatch.com/heroes/pc/global/mode/quick

50.7% for Genji, that's essentially in line with every other hero in the game. Especially considering that + or - 1% is considered marginal in statistics, making a case that he's perfectly balanced currently. I'm definitely not claiming that personally, but it's something to consider. 

No one talks about Lucio with a 57% winrate, maybe it's because hes a support. But think about it. He takes minimal skill to play and his impact is HUGE, how is THAT not something to consider? Genjis impact is STATISTICALLY less then Lucios, AND harder to pull off. 

Lastly, on eSports.

The claim that everyone in tournaments is playing the ""protect the Genji comp"" is just strictly untrue. Every team has a Lucio/Zen/McCree, then the rest basically just map dependent. Yes Genji gets picked a decent amount in eSports, but he's never a massive focal point, moreso just picked to try and eliminate the supports before the fight starts, aka filling his role.

Overall, I believe Genji is balanced, he is rewarding yes. But being rewarding doesn't make him overpowered. The counterplay is 100% there, and if you're playing a competitive TEAM game, you have to be expected to do this. Sorry for all the typing but I had a lot I wanted to say. Thanks.

Why do these designs look SO MUCH BETTER that’s Kiriko’s?,,Overwatch,1663697157.0,t3_xjfws2
[Serious/Long Post]Hanzo is an underrated hero and the smaller projectile hitboxes in the PTR are bad for balance.,"Hanzo occupies a weird place in the overwatch community.  He's both hated for his ""tree trunk arrows"" and ""bs headshots"" and for being too effective in spamming down his shots fishing for kills.  And, at the same time he's reviled for his place within the player's own team for not being effective *enough* with regards to everything from killing enemy players to taking objectives.  This contradictory viewpoint is then extended with regards to the undocumented hitbox change in the PTR.  Redditors have crowed in delight at the ""death of Hanzo mains"" and how they are going to have to ""git gud"" to hit arrows and at the same same time continue to espouse that Hanzo is a useless character made more useless.  The latter is based on the notion that his projectile attack is not reliable damage.  On it's face this seems a reasonable criticism at first, after all, projectiles have a travel time and so they'll land where they were aimed at whether the target is still there or not.  Whereas, hitscan has an immediate effect as soon as you click on the target.  To land an equivalent direct projectile shot, you not only have to aim at a particular point (a target), but also be able to predict where the enemy will be with regards to the travel time of the projectile.  Projectiles use the same base skillset plus extras to hit the same target as a hitscan attack and thus are ""less reliable.""  A basic tenet of game design is that if something is harder to do it should provide extra benefits in terms of higher impact OR some compensatory effect to counter balance the extra effort expanded to have an equivalent impact.  To put it another way, a projectile either has to do a significant amount of damage/utility more or has to have a forgiving margin for error relative to hitscan(the infamous big hitbox).  Now the conundrum in Overwatch here with regards to Hanzo is rooted in two main prongs.

&nbsp;

One: People over value ""reliable damage"" as opposed to burst and utility as the meta in both the professional and pub setting has not recognized much less mastered the ""economy"" of the game yet.

&nbsp;

Two: Overwatch balanced is too highly constrained with not a lot of wiggle room left over.  Characters tend to lean more towards flavors of each other than having unique identities.

&nbsp;

**Chip Damage vs. Burst and 'Feeding' in Overwatch**
The common memes about Hanzo involve him haphazardly spamming and scoring random headshots he ""didn't deserve.""  Of course you can aim with Hanzo, but people often retort that aiming with him is too forgiving because of the larger projectile hitbox.  Hanzo's toolkit can support both these playstyles.  His bow while relatively slow firing compared to Soldier 76's assault rifle, has no clip reload  and can be shot early for less charge if need be, so over a period of time he comes out ahead in spam compared to other projectile classes as he never has to stop flinging arrows.  Sonic arrow can inform you of the best places to spam your shots and the scatter can be shot in tight rooms to hit multiple people.  Alternatively, you can take your time with fully charged shots on picked targets, use your sonic arrow to catch one person around the corner, or aim your scatter at someone's feet to one hit KO or severely chunk them.   Either way, Hanzo's identity is more or less defined on burst and the nature of the burst being so severe is why Hanzo is the focus of these kind of frustrations as opposed to say Torbjorn's rivet gun.

&nbsp;

In Overwatch, they are very careful about sources of overheal, and regen in this game (of which there are several sources) is capped at the max health of the character.  What this means is that Overwatch characters are more resilient to be being chipped down by ""reliable damage"" then they are from burst.  To illustrate an example, if you have a soldier 76 being healed by mercy in range of lucio's heal aura while standing on his own biotic field this is a LOT of hp per second you have to overcome.  Another soldier would have to sweat pretty hard to bring enough dps to mulch past his opponents regen with enough spare change to kill him in a reasonable amount of time.  A Hanzo however could simply shoot a scatter arrow at the feet and one hit KO the soldier no matter how much regen he had.  If the opposing team came with two supports and two tanks, that's half their DPS gone in one blow in exchange for a 10 second cooldown ability.

This is the power and value a Hanzo brings to the team.  In a game where the primary source of extra durability is health regen, burst has a unique value for damage dealing characters.  This is why the damage dealers of overwatch have some sort of burst capability such as s76 rocket or tracer's bomb.  This is also why when McCree had his fan nerfed he faded away from the meta.  FtH was burst damage that finished the fight.  The ""reliable"" laser accurate left click was not enough to keep him around when fan the hammer got bonked.  

Some of you may already be thinking ""but what if the Hanzo doesn't land his arrows?  What if like all the Hanzo's on my team he just eats butt and can't do anything?  If he was soldier he would at least hit some of his shots.""  

But what people don't understand is that chip damage or reliable damage or whatever you want to call it doesn't do anything if the opponent has enough regen to counter act it. In fact if you can't complete the kill it's actually a significant detriment because it feeds ult charge.

&nbsp;

While Overwatch isn't a moba like Dota or LoL, most of the non-casual playerbase is at least somewhat aware that ""feeding"" of a sort does exist in this game.  If you ever been on a team with multiple roadhogs, it can seem like there is an endless barrage of ults being blasted in your face because their high hp pool built in regen and big hitbox insures the enemy has plenty of target practice to build up charge.  But what most people haven't realized is that you ""feed"" when you damage a character but don't kill him.  You feed their supports ult charge when they heal them and in the PTR you feed some characters when they heal themselves with their own abilities.  In pubs many people mistakenly believe as long as you are doing damage you are making some form of forward progress, but in fact you may be setting yourself for being at an ult disadvantage in the long run because you aren't finishing any of these fights.

Even the pros who play this game at a very high level haven't mastered being able to predict ult timing based on damage done and healing done with any accuracy.  Most of the early tournaments are decided by the team with the better overall DM in the flurry of chaos rather than elegant surgical strategies.  Pro's have top tier mechanics but even the ones who played during the private beta are still in a larval stage of development.  As time passes these early tournies will seem as silly as TF2's first e-sports forays with random crits flying everywhere.

&nbsp;

Anyone still reading may already be angrily typing. ""But if Hanzo has all this value why isn't he being picked in pro tournaments with a high pickrate?  Why do they prefer reliable damage?  Do you think you know more than pros?""  While I wouldn't presume myself to be superior than any pro of your choice, I have seen this kind of stuff happen before in e-sports in other games.  While the guys playing this game for a living operate on a higher level than all the regular folks, they still have their own path of development and improvement and different players have different types of backgrounds.  Many of them come from hitscan oriented games and so would trust hitscan oriented characters more.  Others come from games where projectiles are the primary form of attack and thus those are their comfort heroes.  I don't want to name any names for fear of going off an on a tangent, but if you have been watching some of these games it's not unusual to see a player put a clinic on S76 and McCree and then completely embarrass themselves on the Pharah not landing a single direct hit.  The presence of a dark horse in game metas is not a new thing.  In fact, in certain games like Dota, it can be the norm.  A hero is slowly buffed over several patches until it crosses a threshold of power that cannot be denied even if it was already good before.  Riki, an invisible character once thought to only work on low mmr noober kaboobers, emerged finally as the cancerous purple rat that my own personal stack of friends knew him to be after multiple buffs and two reworks.  In TF2 the Loch n Load was at one point thought to be the worst demo gun in the game.  It was a two shot grenade launcher that had high damage but no rollers.  It was designed to land direct hits only.  The old SPUF forums racked their brains trying to find a way to buff this poor gun including letting it reload both pills at the same time.  Then all of a sudden it emerged as a ""cancer weapon.""  Demo mains over time slowly but surely learned to hit things with direct nades instead of relying on the sticky bomb launcher only.  Straight out of 2fort, scouts were getting one shotted left and right.  Butts were pained everywhere and Gabe bathed his knife collection in the tears of blood that were shed.  After literally years of languishing in obscurity the loch n load got a rework.

&nbsp;

In my opinion Hanzo as of the current live patch is in a good spot mechanically.  He is a misunderstood character and wrongfully maligned.  A character that moves with the team and bursts enemies down quickly helps to stagger out both respawn times and ult timings building a solid advantage for your team.

The truth in pubs that people have to face about bad Hanzos, is that bad Hanzos are simply bad players.  They gravitate to him for the same reason people gravitate towards snipers and spies in tf2: Cool factor and the promise of safety by hiding.  If you bully them off of Hanzo you won't get better results.  A bad Hanzo who can't land his arrows is not gonna land projectiles from any other class.  He'll do chip damage at best with characters like pharah, junkrat, or s76 which as we already covered is placebic.  He's not gonna land roadhog hooks or Rein firestrikes so he'll never have any kind of ult advantage.  Even if you managed to force him or her to be Lucio under the hope that at least they can be an aura it would still be a mistake.  A Lucio that can't land his bubbles will be at a severe disadvantage to one who can.  And the Lucio gun is low damage burst projectile weapon that involves leading and tracking and is an order of magnitude more difficult than the Hanzo bow.  Ya'll just gotta deal with the fact that not everybody can play the videogame and move on.

&nbsp;

For pro games an increase of Hanzo is going to be rooted more in the pace of the games and how the modes are handled as well pro's gradually increasing familiarity with projectiles.  Hanzo is a character that plays at his own pace for picks and wombo combos.  Tournaments using stopwatch for instance will cause Hanzo to struggle since it's a character that doesn't want to be in a hurry.  However, if other modes get added like say a one life arena mode; a character like Hanzo that can pick his own fights with his tool kit will emerge there sooner.

&nbsp;

**PART TWO Larger hitboxes are normal for projectiles in these type of games and healthier for Overwatch**

&nbsp;

So in the second prong I said that Overwatch balance is highly constrained and characters aren't all that different from each other.  And if you look at the various stats, the base stats, on the wiki you will see what I mean.

&nbsp;

Most characters barring a few like tracer and genji have the exact same move speed.  Many are are built around the HP number 200 +-50.  And, perhaps most glaringly, the damage values of the attack classes are more less just different flavors of the same gun.  The junkrat grenade launcher has a fire rate of around 1.x seconds and hits pills that do 120 damage.  The Pharah rocket launcher has a similar fire rate and hits rockets that do 120 damage.  Hanzo bow has 1 point something firerate and does 125.  The widow rifle when fully charged up at little over a second does 120 on the body.  Even a character like soldier that uses auto fire has the same number.  His shots do 5-17 damage.  The average of this range is 11.5.  His rifle shoots 10 shots per second. Ten times 11.5 is 115.  Oh and his helix rocket?  It does 120 damage.  You see the picture forming here?  If you look at the Overwatch characters in terms of their basic stats-not their special abilites- but their basic stats they are literally the same character with the same basic attack just with the beads on the abacus nudged this way and that.

&nbsp;

Both before and after this change in the PTR many people bandied about how widow was just a better hanzo.  And if you look at the damage numbers you can see why.  Everyone's got the same basic attack but one is easier to land.  But, imagine if no one had any passives or special abilities; widow would not only have the edge on Hanzo, but pharah as well.  After all, if pharah were forced to waddle around on the ground shooting rockets that did no more damage than widow's bullets than why even bother with that even with the splash damage?  Everyone would just be s76 and widow walking around like in call of duty but no sprinting allowed.  Her flight and her concussive shot are what compensates for her using a slow projectile as opposed to instant bullets even though they do the same damage.  The compensating effect for her disadvantage is her utility.

So what's the issue with Hanzo then you may ask?  His utility is ALL IN on landing his basic attacks.  Sonic arrow is a basic attack gives wall hack which helps landing other basic attacks, wall climb gives good vantage points for landing attacks, and scatter arrow is just a big chunky basic attack that makes tiny smaller basic attacks.  Hanzo's toolkit revolves around shooting his arrows normally while Pharah's toolkit of high burst mobility COMPENSATES for her having to shoot her rockets.

&nbsp;

The only thing that helps hanzo land his arrows versus a hitscan character is the bigger hitbox which despite the tears and crying is the norm in these kinds of games.

&nbsp;

Look how wide the collision hull is in TF2.  Now in this video he covers some of the problems of how this box is handled.  Namely it's locked to the axis of the map.  But this collision hull is MUCH wider than the Overwatch hitbox in the live version.  Look how far away the needle is from the head and still lands the shot.  All the characters from the tiny scout to the fat heavy have this SAME EXACT collision hull.

&nbsp;

In this video the huntsman is used against the collision hull

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx-YFFnruDs

 &nbsp;

As you can see all you have to do to land a head shot is to hit that big box.  People complained about hitting the heads shooting at the side of the door jam but if a tf2 character was standing next to an overwatch door it would be a headshot shooting down the middle of the door not just next to it.

&nbsp;

Here's the controversial part:  There's nothing wrong with this design.  In fact because of it's simplicity it's extremely solid and helps greatly in the balance of projectiles versus hitscan.  TF2 for all it's bloat is still very robust in it's balance.  Without these big hitboxes, demomen would be utterly helpless against scouts and even with them scouts still have the advantage in the match up.

&nbsp;

So this is the problem: even with the current big hitbox many poopoo Hanzo's effectiveness versus widowmaker who's fallen away in the meta herself lately.  If you make it harder to land a projectile attack by narrowing the hitbox closer to model and do nothing for Hanzo he objectively gets even harder to play.  For those who are unbiased enough to not be okay with that may just say "" Why not buff him then?""

Well this is the other big wall we run into.  **The simple design of Overwatch characters based on basic principles tweaked with flavor and ultimates while seemingly straight forward in a vacuum looking at each individual character, unintentionally creates extreme rigid complexity when looking at all the characters together relationally.**  Or to put another way: Blizzards balancing style has painted themselves in a corner to what they can do.

&nbsp;

*So why not Buff Hanzo's damage?*
Remember how we went through the basic attacks of several dps characters and saw they all did basically the same amount of damage with that magic number: 120?  There's a reason for that.  There are several characters in the game that boost damage against characters: Ana ult, mercy blue beam, and zen orb  of discord.  If your character's damage crosses a certain break point with these helpful buffs they start one shotting people.  This is why Blizzard loves the number 120.  A 50 percent bonus to this give 180 which will put a 200 hp class CLOSE to death but avoid one shotting them.  If you buffed hanzo's damage to counter act for his projectile based attack you quickly put him a position to one shot 200 hp classes and beyond.  The head box in live for his projectile, while larger than the hitscan one, is still smaller than a characters entire body.  If people thought getting headshot was annoying they would be ultra pissed at getting dinged in the body for one blow after getting discorded.

&nbsp;

*So why not buff the firerate?*

This suggestion was passed around before when people were wondering what it would take for Hanzo to enter the pro meta.  And on the surface it makes sense.  If you have more trouble landing arrows why not buff the firerate to compensate instead?  If for simplicity's sake it was twice as hard to land an arrow but you made hanzo shoot twice as fast wouldn't that balance things out while keeping these ""more accurate"" hitboxes?

The problem with this change again deals with the relationship with other classes.  Yes for a hitting a standard attack class with a small projectile hitbox getting an extra shot to hit would help despite it being harder to do so.  But in the same way the damage buff causes a problem because of the interaction with supports, a fire rate increase causes issues with the interaction with tanks--by shooting them. 

&nbsp;

A fat tank is an easy target to hit even based on the character hitbox alone.  Roadhog is much wider than tracer even if Tracer had TF2's big collision hull.  Now all of a sudden you have twice as much hanzo arrows slamming into roadhogs at a minimum of 125 a pop.  These arrows are also tearing that reinhart's shields from a distance as well.  One thing that people forgot about Widow when she had 150 damage bodyshots was that it was actually pretty efficient for her to help to shoot charged shots on the Rein shield to help your team burst it down.  A Hanzo with a Legolas buff would be hitting for 250 in roughly the same amount of time.  This means all of a sudden he's entering Reaper's wheelhouse as a tank buster without having to take the same risk as reaper by getting in close.

&nbsp;

*Why not buff projectile speed?*

This suggestion has also been seen and like the others it works on paper but the problem herein has to do with the fact there is no threshold of speed that works without crossing the Rubicon one way of the other.  If the arrow isn't fast enough Hanzo doesn't compare with Widow well enough because while it may be easier to land than before at the end it is still projectile that does only 5 more damage than the widow bullet and has a lower head shot multiplier.

If you made the arrow so fast that were effectively bullet speeds like in hardcore war fps where you only notice a difference in extreme ranges, then all of a sudden Hanzo encroaches on widow's turf because now he's shooting a quieter version of her bullet that doesn't reveal his position with bright red line.

There's also a flavor issue.  Some may scoff at this but boosting the speed of the arrow to compensate changes the character and diminishes the flavor of the class.  Considering how characters are heavily templated this a significant problem.

&nbsp;

*So what's left?*

Well the magic word here if you can't do anything with the damage is to add utility.  Let's just spitball a bit here and say what if Hanzo arrows had a cripple effect.  Yeah they are hard to land but if you hit somebody they move at a crawl making a follow up shot easier to land.  This has team fight utility as well helping other classes land shots on the target so a Hanzo and Widow team would actually have synergy with Hanzo slowing a target down and Widow following it up with an easy headshot.

So what's what problem here?  Well in an action fps utility is often a euphemism for really annoying mechanics.  Already we are seeing the massive grief potential with Ana's sleep shot making someone completely helpless for 5 seconds.  The mcree flashband during the fan the hammer days was already considered monstrous and it only lasted 0.7 seconds.  There is a whole movement of hate on Mei for her utility as it can hurt her own team as well.

&nbsp;

I've typed this all up in wordpad so I hope the formatting isn't a mess but these are my closing thoughts for any who stayed awake to read all of this.

&nbsp;

Overwatch is a fun game but it's simplistic and casual approach to how characters are designed around a template where everyone shares the same basic magic numbers means there isn't a lot of wiggle room without stepping on each other toes.  This template is modified by a set of abilities or a gimmick if you will that characterizes how they go about their role.  The interaction of these gimmicks and how they apply their magic numbers creates a relationship of counters with other characters.  Hanzo's toolset sets him up as a mid to  long range burst character that counters health regen as a source of durability.  As it stands currently I believe that's it's too early in the game's lifespan to determine if he's as weak as people say.  As high level players get better at the game and as the structure of the game whether through the meta or through different gamemodes develops around say a slower type of pace, I believe we'll see hanzo come in on his own naturally.

&nbsp;

Overwatch's simple character template, while making it easier to understand compared to other class based shooters, creates a deadlock in their own game design as each individual character must keep every other character in mind.  This means that they are beholden to the magic numbers shared by everyone.  This simple straight forward design demands a simple straight forward solution.  If tweaking one character's numbers causes it to become so easily overtuned that it slights another character's role; and considering such, if each character is bound by this number, then characters who are harder to play to enact these same values must have compensatory relief that occurs OUTSIDE their own character balance.  Which is a complicated way of saying that the big ugly projectile hitbox is the most comprehensive solution that balances projectiles versus hitscan both now and in the future.

Soldier 76 Is The Best Way To Make a Gay Character,"Soldier 76 is one of the two best ways to have gay characters. 

The way soldier 76 is gay is ""he sleeps with and has relationships with men"" and that's it. Because that's what the words homosexual and homoromantic mean. Nobody cares, hes the same person we've always known, it doesn't make any impact him other than the man he used to be in love with also has a penis.

The character, isn't different or special because he's gay or straight. The sacrifices he made to do his part protecting the weak and innocent aren't any different. He just happens to be gay, and in all actuality it doesn't matter at all. Which is honestly the most positive and loving message blizzard could possibly provide with  a gay character.

""Your sexuality isn't who you are, it doesn't determine anything about you, what you can do or what you can do""

Which is a surprisingly brave and positive message. In a world fully people who think ""being gay"" means fulfilling some ridiculous stereotype, and allowing that to form the center of their personality and the image they put forward to the world, it's nice to see a company like Blizzard say something real and positive, and hopefully is the start of an era where people will stop being so obsessed with what's in each other pants, and whose genitals they're touching, ans instead actually care about who the character is, and who the people are, instead some wacked out backwards and often pejorative and discriminatory marketing ploy like ""representation"" and ""diversity""

I'm glad soldier 76 is gay, not because LGBT needs ""representation"" (because it's totally not ridiculous and discriminatory to claim to represent such a diverse and complex group if people accurately simply because of who they have sex with, it's totally nothing like racism or sexism to claim that because of a person's immutable physical traits, they are a certain way). I'm glad because Blizzard is the first company I know of to do it right. They have a character who just is gay. The entire character isn't ""LOOK HES GAY!!"" he just happens to be gay, and it's totally irrelevant, and no one who isn't interested in fucking him cares, as it should be both in real life, and amongst heros like in overwatch.

Why i don't like BETA's like this (E-sport related),"This may sound stupid, but these are just some personal reasons of mine. 

I personaly don't like BETA's that are closed off like Overwatch becasue i feel like it's really unfair for people who want to become good at the game and maybe participate in potential e-sports.

I feel like it ends up that a good percentage of the people who get into the BETA and want to go pro end up being at the top of the scene for a while, at least this is how it was for the first years of League of Legends, since there is so much room and time for you to develop your skill and get better at the game.

For example, there are a few people in the BETA at the moment who are really good and only keep improving. Even though you can get good by practicing in games like TF2 and CS:GO, Overwatch is still a different game. Practicing in Overwatch will pay off way more than practicing in CS:GO and TF2.

I personaly feel that this creates an unfair gap when the game gets released, since you will have people who are insanely good and will already be signing for teams or would have put together their own teams to start competing.

It feels like your participating in a 100m sprint, except the people in the beta get a 25m headstart. Now the thing is, so far, we know that this 'phase' of the BETA is going to last till mid/late december. 

Who knows what that means. It could mean that more people will be allowed into the CLOSED BETA which will create an even bigger gap. So for example, the people that were in from the start get a 30m lead and the people who got in after december get a 15m lead, which still leaves you in last place.

Another thing that annoys me is that when you hear about these big e-sport companys like CLG that confirm they are going to have a proffesional team in Overwatch, who has more chance of getting in? A guy who has lots of BETA experience and is quite good at the game, or a guy who started playing for a month since release and still has that extra 30m to go?

Of course i understand that having proffesional experience in other games like CS:GO and TF2 will help your chances greatly, but you still don't have the experience in Overwatch like the BETA players do. The worst part is that these BIG teams will most likely already be put together just before BETA ends, which by then the 100m race is already pretty much over, unless someone fell over on the way and you can overtake them (Very silm chance).

I perfectly understand that the BETA is very limited at the moment and that BETA's like this are needed otherwise the game would be ruined when it's released becasue of bugs and what not. So far i personaly think it's being handled pretty well.

I'm personaly not very good at shooters, but that wouldn't stop me from atleast giving it my all to go pro. I would like to at least give it a shot to win the 100m race, but with all these people starting ahead of me, it makes it quite hard to compete.

Sorry for re-using the 100m sprint example over and over, but i personaly felt it best explained the situation.

I probably missed a few points out, but I would like to hear what you think about the situation and whether you disagree with me or not :3",Overwatch,1446566345.0,t3_3rd64m
This sub is harsh with the new event...,"I usually dont post or comment on stuff, but seeing what is going on on the main page of this sub right now is kinda unfair in my oppinion.  
There are like 10 diffrent posts all saying that the event was underwhelming and what not, that people waited a whole year for THIS and ist just not what they expected and i think its fine to be disappointed with the mission itself, to each their own, but i dont think the developers deverse this kind of hate...   


First of all, the main game is still there, you know QP, arcade, ranked. The event is a nice bonus that was added for free, like every other event, so we can enjoy some PvE and new stuff for our favorite Heroes.  
Then again, i personally dont think the mission was THAT bad. It was a bit short and i played through most of the achievments already (only legendary difficulty missing right now) so it wont last me until the event is over, but the lore behind it is nice, we get to see (or hear) 2 fairly new characters, Sojourn and the guy at the end, where i can already smell the wave of 10+min videos regarding his identity (IS THIS HERO 31????????) and what not. The ending cinematic as a nice cliffhanger and leaves stuff open for future events, leading me to my next point!

  
Right now, YouTuber Ohnickel is at BlizzHQ and streams the event with Jeff. From what i've heard, Jeff said something along the line of ""there is something big coming for the Anniversary"" or so. My uneducated guess is that we are getting ""part 2"" of this mission when the Anniversary event drops... i doubt it, but i like to believe :)  


Also! The Skins in this event are AMAZING, every single one of them (except zarya maybe) looks really really nice with lots of details (just check out hammonds new Highlight intro with his new Skin) and are a big step-up to the Chinese New Year event Skins we got this year.

To the people who complain about “counterswappers”,"Counter swapping is an intended game mechanic. Heroes will always have counters. A tank isn’t “trash” or worse than you for counter picking the tank that you’re playing, it’s just common sense. Please learn a few different characters and stop being a one trick pony or stop whining. Thanks x

Edit: This isn't to say I don't believe some of the more hard counters in the game shouldn't be adjusted. There are definitely some unfair character matchups (Doom/Sombra, Hog/Ana, Pharah into Bastion or any hitscan) which do need to be fixed so nobody is left feeling like they are ""forced"" to swap. But that's the thing - balancing a hero shooter with so many heroes with many different play styles and abilities is not easy. There will always be characters who are better than others, more meta, and some who counter others. 

Accusing people of being bad or trash for counter swapping your hero is like flaming somebody for playing a character who is meta. Saying that people who counter swap are compensating for their lack of skill is the hardest cope I've ever seen, if you were truly more skilled than your opponent, in most cases you can just play into your counter and win anyway (aside from the few hard counters mentioned before and a couple others).

"Anyone who justifies trolling with ""it's just quickplay"" should be permabanned.","I'm getting tired of getting teammates in this game that justify their shitty actions and shitty behavior with ""Chill out dude it's just quickplay"". I don't mind weird team comps. People can play whatever dps they want, whatever tank they want, whatever healer they want.... but I'm getting tired of getting into these games where there's 5 dps and I have to choose between tanking or healing. If I ask anyone politely to switch to a healer or a tank, they justify their actions with ""it's just quickplay, chill"" like the objective of quickplay isn't still to win the game. I'm tired of having to go into competitive to have games that actually don't end up in a stall at our first spawn point because no one wants to play healer or tank. It's an actual waste of time to play games like this and they should all be permabanned.

&#x200B;

Edit:

As a lot of people have pointed out just now, perhaps I worded my initial statement incorrectly. The provided example is just one such behavior that I consider to be toxic. My main point is that fact that it is quickplay is not justification to fuck around and do absolutely whatever you want. People have taken it to mean that. Another example example of toxic behavior is playing Mercy and only healing your duo partner. There's plenty of examples of toxic behavior that people tend to justify with ""it's just a quickplay game"".

&#x200B;

Edit#2: 

The original intent of this post was mainly because out of frustration, I created this post to discuss and debate about acceptable behavior vs toxic behavior in Quickplay. Also to discuss the 'actual' purpose of quickplay. A lot of people think that Quickplay is a casual game mode while Competitive is a serious game mode. This is true. However, just because quickplay is a casual game mode does not make it okay for people to be toxic and troll. I provided a example initially of people playing 6 DPS and this was a mistake. Since a lot of people have issues understand my ONE example listed in my original post I'll further elaborate.   


What I do mean: If your team is struggling with a 6 man DPS pick and being stalled at the first point for the entire duration of the game. It's probably best to switch off to something more viable so that your team can compete. Quickplay is not an excuse to give up the objective of the game. It entirely possible to do very well with 6 DPS and even if you don't win the game with 6 DPS, that's fine.   


What I don't mean/What you guys think I meant: 6DPS = automatic cancer. Ban anyone who goes 6DPS.

"Mercy stole Overwatch from me, and took away my identity as a flex support.","TL;DR:  Mercy rework made me unable to play my beloved Ana, so I ended up not playing my favorite game for a few months, despite being on the cusp of reaching top500.  Stop complaining about Mercy nerfs ruining the game for you.  The Mercy rework *actually* ruined the game for so many of us, as it made our heroes unplayable, where as post nerf Mercy is still a powerful and viable healer.  

Story:

I have been playing Overwatch since launch.  I started playing competitive in Season 2, and I placed in plat.  I decided to take the game very seriously, and I worked hard on my aim, my positioning, and my ability to work with the team.

When Ana came out, I began maining her, as her kit felt so versatile and impactful.  I ground my way up through the seasons, reaching Grandmaster in season 5.  At this point, I felt like a very skilled support player - I nailed my sleeps, hit big anti nades, killed Genjis and Pharahs... it was a good time.  All the work I had put into my mechanics was showing, both on Ana and Zenyatta.  I felt like I was becoming a really good player, who could break into top 500 with a few more seasons of hard work.

And then came the Mercy rework.  

After the rework, Ana mains had 2 total options heading into a match: Play an overpowered hero that doesn't allow any of your aiming skills to be relevant, or play an underpowered hero and get flamed by your team the entire time and probably lose.  

At first I was reluctant, but eventually everyone saw just how OP Mercy was, and I decided to commit to playing her, assuming a nerf was incoming soon and I would be able to go back to the heroes I loved.  

The more I played OP Mercy, the more I climbed.  I ended up one game from Top 500.. but I decided to not play anymore that season.  I didn't want to waltz into t500 on the back of some failed rework, I wanted to earn it the same way I had earned all my previous ranks.  

Unfortunately, this lead to another 2 choices:  Play Ana and get flamed/probably lose, or start playing DPS and Tanks.  Since I had worked so much on my aim prior to the Mercy rework, I figured I would try my hand at DPS.

I quickly learned, however, that playing nothing but Mercy for a month doesn't do your aim any favors.  I used to be a competent DPS when I had to fill, but now I couldn't seem to hit anything, and whenever I was able to get a kill, a Mercy would jaunt over and tap their E button to erase my hard work.

Most importantly, I didn't enjoy playing DPS.  I am an Ana/Zen player, that's who I loved playing, that's where all of my best OW memories are.  Sure, I could still play Zen here and there if I had a mercy main on the team, but it wasn't the same.

Then one day I realized: I wasn't having fun anymore.  Overwatch had turned into a Mercy centered shit fest, and I didn't want anything to do with it.  All of the hard work I put into learning Ana was retroactively made pointless, making me feel like I had wasted hundreds of hours of my life.  With no nerfs in site, I lost hope, and lost interest in even playing the game.  

I went from a borderline top500 support player, with a burning passion for the game, to a depressed Mercy bot who couldn't play his favorite heroes.  The game I loved, the identity I had, all stolen from me....

So Mercy mains.  Now that your hero has Finally been taken down from her spot as the objectively most powerful hero in the game, think about my story before you go complain on the blizz forum.  You think you have it rough right now?  You think it's unfair that people hate on Mercy and celebrate the nerfs?

I didn't complain when Ana was nerfed way back whenever that was.  As long as I was able to play my hero and win matches, I was happy.  You can still pick Mercy and win games and have fun... but that option was taken from me when the Moth first came to be.  I hope this shows you why so many people hold hatred for Mercy in their hearts, and I hope it shows you that you are FAR from the first subset of players to be negatively impacted by a balance change.

The New Player Experience is terrible and needs to be reworked,"I'm brand new to Overwatch. Never played the first game, never watched a guide or vods of pro play, going in completely green. 

Why are new players locked out of voice comms and text chat until they complete 10 games? Who thought of that idea, and how did it make it into the release version of the game? 

It's a 5V5 PVP game, how am I supposed to coordinate with my team if I can't communicate? I don't know of a single other PVP title that locks new players out from communicating with their team. If i'm playing with experienced players then it basically makes it a 4v5, which doesn't feel good for my teammates. 

Please change it. Please. I am not willing to recommend this game to other new players because I know they will be forced to beat their head against a wall for 10 games and hate every second of that time.",Overwatch,1671865588.0,t3_zu4afp
Unpopular Opinion: I still love this game!,"I can name about 10 things I would love changed in this game, but it's still by far the best game I have ever played and I can't quit it. Yes I play another game for an hour or so a day to break up the time when I get tilted. But for the most part this is still my main game and I still play it every day and love it more often then I get tilted!

&#x200B;

Name me another shooter type game that has this sort of depth and teamplay that is still fun to play for someone with limited aim and reflexes?? (i'm old, i'm 38...lol) I love the teamplay, I love communicating with them through coms, I love the diverse cast with their own strengths and weaknesses. I love the free loot you get just for playing the game (at this point I have just about every thing in the game as I have been playing since just after release. I just hunt for new event content). I have played every single comp season and have slowly moved from Bronze all the way up to Plat now and I get better each season.....I doubt I will ever be Masters or GM, but you never know.

&#x200B;

Yes, there is a laundry list of things that this game can improve. Role queue for comp, more lore through comics or animated shorts, more hero's being added quicker than 3 per year, map or hero bans, you get the idea.

&#x200B;

I think the real biggest problem is, this game became too popular, hear me out here........ we now have thousands of players that got this game at discounted prices that are just kids that have no intention of becoming competitive and just want to play around with Genji, McCree or Reaper and get the big POTG, or they simply want to troll in their spare time. This popularity also brought in tons of jagged COD and Destiny fans that simply wanted to play a new shooter game and only want to log in to play Hanzo or Widow to click heads and never enter voicechat.....I know we got these types of players ever since launch, but the shear number of them has increased dramatically in the past year or so.

&#x200B;

But there is still so much to love about it as well and I think most of this negativity that keeps creeping in is just because players are so involved in this game they come up with about 20 idea's of changes (ie the Seagull video) and everyone sees that big list and says, ""well why aren't Blizzard doing these things? This game must really suck!"" No quite the opposite, the fact that players are coming up with these idea's just goes to show you how much everyone still wants to love this game, because it is a great game. No one wants to admit it nowadays, but we all still love and play this game every day, (there's a reason we are all in this sub daily...lol)

&#x200B;

Anyway, good luck all and I'm still looking forward to great things in this game in 2019!  I think the fact that we got no map teaser at Blizzcon is a sign that Blizzard is changing up their release schedule for 2019 which I hope is a sign of changes in their events and hero release schedule!!",Overwatch,1545055326.0,t3_a70237

Summer Lootbox Overreaction,"Hello.  
Im calling from the other side.  
No seriously.  
I dont get the hate.  
I fully expected seasonal only items would be used as a cashbait. Maybe its a realisation you get when you played enough cash-vampire games (Archeage for example)....
  
Even if you played WoW for the past 3 or so years you should know the horrendous prices for account services and minipets (10$? Lol). You should *KNOW* Blizzard is a company that makes money of of convenience  and style/prestige items.
But They deliver a solid gaming experience and are masters of Hype.
Overall the skins are items you dont actually need. Its a Bonus.

Thats just how the world is.

*EDIT: Clarification: people seem to think I defend Blizzard. I´m not. I just cant understand why people are surprised about their buisiness methods. Also make sure to read /u/Mornar ´s post in here.",Overwatch,1470395756.0,t3_4w9wbx
Why are so many people defending this obviously predatory system in Overwatch 2?,"The Battlepass would've been fine, had you at least been able to earn back the Credits you used on it, like literally any other Battlepass system out there.

Besides Legacy Credits, you cant get old skins without buying them with real money.

Some new legendary skins, specifically on Junker Queen, are straight up recolors being sold for 2000 Credits, which is absurd for a recolor.

Even the prices for OWL All Star skins are raised, which is disingenuous.

So why do so many people defend Blizzard of all companies for all this dogshit? They've been doing things like this with their other games and it finally arrived to Overwatch. How are you guys okay with this, 'cus even as somebody who can afford to buy anything in that shop its still ass to me.

**Edit- Also I keep seeing people compare this system to other games like Fortnite. In fortnite you earn 1500 vbucks back from battlepasses, and in this game you get 0.**

**You will only be able to earn 540/season from weekly challenges, and thats if you play everyday, all day and ensure you do not miss a week. This system is a mess.**

**So to put this in perspective:**

**2 seasons of Fortnite = 3000 ""Credits"" = 3 purchasable Battlepasses**

**2 seasons of Overwatch 2 = 1080 ""Credits"" = 1 purchasable Battlepass (ONLY IF YOU PLAY EVERY DAY AND GET ALL THE CREDITS, if you miss it GG you're fucked.)**",Overwatch,1664474962.0,t3_xrerc8

CLOSED BETA: Disadvantage over the people who’s not in.,"Like the title says. 
&nbsp;

I know that a beta is for testing the game, reporting bugs, fixing technical problems, balancing the game. We really know, but this doesn’t make the “Disadvantage” fact less true.

&nbsp;

A Beta Tester can get to know the game and practice already for the Future Competitive Scene and can also give plenty of feedback and reports. **Both things are compatible.** Also, if a player know how to be pro at a game and really desire it, he or she will play several hours a day and make them worth. A few days ago I read an article about a competitive player from another game. He said he was training at least 6-8 horus a day and that most of the time they played +10 hours per day.

&nbsp;

**So what’s the difference in 3 months?**
&nbsp;

-	90 days * 6 hours = +500 hours played.
-	90 days * 10 hours = +900 hours played.
-	Being involved with other players that have the same goals as you.
-	Creating already competitive teams.
-	Being already successful in Closed Beta tournaments and getting famous for it.

&nbsp;

So, that are tons of advantages in the competitive play, aren’t they?
&nbsp;

I’m not going to say a solution, I am not Blizzard. But I really think they should try to find a solution to balance or solve this issue. It's a fact, it's happening.
&nbsp;

People has proved that the Hearthstone Beta was launched for a limited people, and those people are currently the most famous and professional (in most of the cases).
&nbsp;

I also want to point that , after the Wave of today, I’ve seen plenty of Streamers from other games, giving only a limited time in their channel for Overwatch and then saying: *“bleh im tired, im going back to my game, maybe I’ll play more Overwatch in a few days”*. 
&nbsp;

We're hundreds of people here wishing to play the game with so much passion and desire you cannot even imagine, please enjoy as much as you can your Beta >.<

The Torb/Bastion Rage is getting a little silly - How to counter easily,"It's hard to accept, but countering Torbjorn and Bastion is something you learn with experience. Having been in the beta for a long time, I too when through the rage stage, where it was seemingly impossible to take out a turret or sieged Bastion.

Thing is though, it's not hard to do at all. You just need to play as a team, using any of the following combinations:

* Reinhardt + any ranged character
* Winston + Mercy
* Zarya + any character who knows what to do when they are shielded (get hit alot)
* Widowmaker on any map that's moderately open
* Junkrat (if needed take a Mercy with you)
* Tracer (If you are feeling brave)
* Reinhardt Shield Advance with the team behind it
* Symmetra in any configuration

Honestly, it gets easier to handle the turrets once you know how to counter play them. Their strongest weapon is the rage and disarray they cause when someone gets killed more than once with one, as they lead to syncopated respawns, so people start rolling in one by one trying to be the hero and getting mowed down. Random groups are often reluctant to use Teamplay, as lets face it, people can be assholes. The game is a team based shooter, if you aren't following the games basic principle, you are a bad, simple as that.",Overwatch,1455620127.0,t3_461z0c

If that is the case then why is an achievement for 30 heroes to level 20 already in the game? If you don't have any plans to make more heroes the logical thing would be to set it at 21 and see what goes from there. [Source](http://www.overpwn.com/news/85-possible-content-teaser-overwatch-strings)

"Dear blizzard: Please, for the love of god, do not do console exclusivity with heroes/map","After the announcement that the Winston animated short ""Recall"" was going to[premier exclusively on the Xbox website.](http://us.battle.net/overwatch/en/blog/20063490) A lot of talk has stirred in regards to how future heroes and maps will be handled when it comes to releasing them and people are worried that this will lead to what we have seen with call of duty/battlefield where additional content is gated to one platform for a month while the rest have to wait.

Please for the love of competitive integrity and fairness in this game, do not do this. It would provide a significantly unfair advantage to those who are playing on a specific console and allow them to understand heroes before others get a chance to play them.

Example being: Say if Reaper, one of the strongest heroes out there, was locked to xbox one for a month before coming to the other platforms, players who have OW on Xbox and say PC, would already know how to play him and have a significant advantage over other players.


Games like Destiny, COD and Battlefield have both shown this to be a pain in the ass for other players who just want to play and not have to deal with timed release bullshit.

Can people just not play competitive if they have 'unstable internet' ?,"we had a reinhardt on our team who said at the beginning of the match 'my internet is a little unstable atm but we can still win', at first i was not ok with that but just decided to see what happens. the enemy team was pretty shit but we pushed the payload as far as we could until our reinhardt just stood there doing nothing for a few minutes before dc'ing.

enemy team took advantage of this and decided to do a quadruple tank with 2 healers against 1 healer, a junkrat that refused to switch, a roadhog that couldn't land many hooks and a replacement reinhardt that just kept charging in alone.

no wonder the guy that left was boarderline silver lmao

seriously though, if you have frequent internet dropouts/unstable internet, stop playing competitive, you're ruining the game for everyone.

"The ""DPS mains are dumb, always praise support and tank mains"" thing needs to stop.","Before I start, I'm gonna make it clear that I'm a support main, and I respect the hell of of a good DPS main.

Far too often, there are posts and comments which basically shit on DPS mains, being far too quick to blame them for the games problems, or their team's problems. For example, there are support mains who are claiming that the only reason people are saying Brigitte is broken is because ""salty DPS mains don't like the idea of getting killed by a support"". News flash, almost everyone hates Brigitte, even support and tank mains, not just the DPS mains, she's simply broken.

According to a lot of support and tank mains, they can do no wrong. The Lucio just does their sick rollout onto the point and miserably dies because they left their team behind? Well it's obviously the DPS' fault for not following in with them! The Zenyatta tried to right click peek the Widowmaker who is obviously good at Widowmaker and gets domed, delaying our push again? It's the DPS' fault for not taking her out before!

There are obviously exceptions to this, DPS players can fuck up, but so can support and tank players. I'd even say that support and tank players are even more prone to fucking up than DPS players, since positioning is key with these players.

But no, it's always the DPS players fault. I forgot that support and tank mains are never at fault, they're basically Jesus. Just stop, you're making us support and tank mains look like idiots.

Transgender Individual and Their Experience with Toxicity,"Full disclosure: I was born female. I am now a man. Not going to go into reasons why I made this decision other than I felt more comfortable the way I am now than I was in the past. 

My experience with toxicity has been relatively the same. But my displeasure with the community as a whole has increased. Especially pertaining to the female player base. 

Before my transition. I experienced my share of the typical female harassment. I don't think I need to write down any examples. We all know what they are. Many people would speak out against the harassment. Especially other female players. 

It all went downhill from there. After my transition. My voice is for a lack of a better term is ""Different"". People pick up that I am not your typical male player. I would say someone like me does experience more toxicity as a guy because of it. The thing is though. I have never had a girl stand up for me when I get harassed since the change. In fact. Since becoming a man. I have had female players actually join in on the toxicity or even instigate it. Something that never happened when I was a girl. 

Certain female players constantly remind the community that the female player base gets harassed quite a bit and it's up to the community (especially the male player base) as a whole to deter such a thing. But in my experience. Female players will rarely stand up for male players. They will stay silent and watch it happen or some of the more cynical female players will join in on the harassment.

There is definitely a double standard when it comes to your gender on the internet. When I was a girl. People defended me without even me having to ask. Sometimes people will defend me even when the other person wasn't even being rude or toxic. White knights like this obviously are a minority but it still only happened when I was a girl. Now that I am a man. Nobody defends me or white knights for me. I'm basically on my own. Not that I can't take care of myself because I can. I just find it really hypocritical for so many female players to demand the male player base to do a better job at deterring targeted harassment to females but when guys get harassed. The female players are just happy they are not the ones getting harassed and will just watch silently on the side. Some even get swept up in the mob mentality and join in on the harassment. I have never been harassed by a female player back when I was still a girl. It has only started after I became man which is really disheartening to say the least. 

**TLDR:** If female players are demanding a better environment for them. Then a lot of the female players need to stop dragging their feet and help out as well. Stop staying in the shadows and watching others get harassed and letting out a sigh of relief that it isn't you but then make a ""friendly reminder"" that men need to do a better job at pointing out toxicity towards females and speaking out against it. 

I would like to end this post off by saying this is obviously my own personal experience and does not apply to others and that I am more than capable of defending myself after 23+ years of gaming. Just feel like I should share my personal experience with regards to toxicity before and after my sex change. As a guy who gets treated and harassed like a girl. It's upsetting to see so many female players in my game stay silent when I'm the one getting harassed simply because I am now a ""man"". When I was the same gender as them. They were more than happy to speak out against the harassment.

Thank you for reading. Best of luck in your future games. 

**EDIT:**

Quite a bit of discussion regarding whether or not I am biologically a man or not. Not to be rude to anybody but the point of the post was not that but to point out the inconsistent behavior of certain female players with regards to them wanting men to provide a safer and more enjoyable environment for them yet they stand on the side and watch men get harassed online. I'm merely pointing out the double standard and hypocritical actions of certain female players that I have witnessed personally both before and after my transition. Speaking out against toxicity should not only be applicable when the female is the victim. It should be applied to men as well. And I know it's counter-intuitive to say that harassment does not bother me despite having this long thread but it honestly doesn't. I have been gaming probably longer than some of you guys have been alive. I'm capable of defending myself. I'm just disappointed that so little female players will speak out against toxicity when a ""guy"" is a victim of it yet so many will actively demand ""men"" to make more of an effort to make the internet a more comfortable place for females. There were definitely a lot more people of all genders defending me before my transition than after it. Now it rarely occurs and it's almost always from men; not women. But again. I can defend myself on the internet. I'm not asking for protection. Just pointing out inconsistencies I have personally experienced. 

**EDIT #2:**

This post has shown me a couple things. Majority of people don't or can't read for starters and/or jump to conclusions.

To those asking me: how does it come up in a conversation? It doesn't. I don't join games and reveal I'm transgender. People just automatically jump to that conclusion because my voice is noticeably different for a guy which again attracts unwanted attention and harassment but nothing I can't deal with on my own. My problem is not about the harassment. But more about the lack of effort many female players put into dealing with harassment while they actively tell men to do a better job at creating a safe environment for them. I don't understand why so many people are telling me to ""move on and deal with it"" when I specifically said multiple times already that I have zero issues dealing with toxicity. I'm merely pointing out inconsistent behavior among certain groups of female players. 

Like let's be very honest right now. **If it was not for me revealing myself as a transgender. I would have been down-voted to hell and back for just suggesting that a lot of the female players does not put in the same amount of effort that they expect the men to put in.** Like maybe less than 6 or 7 replies actually commented on that. Majority of the responses was regarding something entirely different like whether or not I can be biologically male or telling me that I need to deal with toxicity better which I have made clear like 5 times that I was capable of doing and this was not the point of the thread. 

As someone who was born as a girl. It does bother me to see how this issue has unraveled. Where harassment does not apply to anybody but female players. Men apparently cannot be victims of harassment. And even if they are. It is treated as a small issue that ""they have to deal with on their own"". We may not say that out loud but it obviously being perceived that way just based on the many responses I have gotten and the many responses I have seen on other threads where the victims of harassment are revealed to be female. 

Despite everything that has been said and written here. I will continue to do my part. If I see toxicity happening regardless of the gender of the victim. I will speak out on it. And I urge SPECIFICALLY THE FEMALE PLAYERS to do a better job at that as well when the victim is a male. It's not only up to the male player base to create a safe environment for females. It's up to female players as well. Harassment of any kind regardless of the gender of the victim should not be acceptable. 

I would like to thank those that personally took the time and energy to read what I wrote and write a response that actually contributed to the discussion I was bringing up. ",Overwatch,1525812095.0,t3_8i04bf

"OWL homophobia, sexism, and racism needs to stop being defended","Everyone this is getting rediculous. Not saying bliz handled the whole situation well, but they have a growing number of these incidents. They have to stop ASAP. The players are professionals, they need to be treated as such. The fans need to stop letting players who act this way off by vitimizing them.

There is no problem with cursing or getting upset at situations since tensions are high but it can never devolve into personal attacks using sexual orientation, race, or gender. 

The two defenses of this action seem to be the other homophobic players got lesser punishments, and this isn't a big deal since it happens in all sports. Neither are logicalilly sound arguements.

Their punishments will keep getting harder and harder untill this nonsense stops. It should never have been tolerated to begin with. Video game culture has been pretty tolerant of this BS for too long, which is now showing in OWL. 

Other sports do not have this problem as much. I can't remember last time NBA, NFL, or NHL have had an incident, they at least are smart enough to do it when the cameras are not rolling or not at all. Even if they do, since when does that make it ok?

Sports generally will increase bans and fines untill its painful enough to hurt. Hopefully we reach that point soon so we do better.

"This game was better before Brigitte, and will be much better once she’s nerfed properly.","I know this post will be downvoted to hell. On this subreddit, controversial opinions are not allowed, and criticizing support heroes is a cardinal sin. 

But I’ll do it anyway. 

Brigitte is not fun to play with. Before I start talking about why I think she’s overpowered, let me share an anecdote of my play. Before making a decision, i decided to use her in QP and arcade as much as possible. 

I found that I was very effective with her. Often I would finish with gold elims and healing and objective time. I rarely died more than 3 times a match, and overall dominated every 1v1 I found myself in. 

I did not enjoy this. I found that I can win almost any fight following a simple combo. Shield bash. M1. Whip. When I start taking damage, hold up the shield while I heal. Wait a could seconds and repeat. Doesn’t matter who it was. Reaper, DVa, tracer, genji, Ana... it really didn’t matter. The opponent had a choice. Run, or die. 

I didn’t feel skilled doing this. There’s a sense of pride when you rack up a couple headshots with mcree, land a few direct hits with Pharah, land some great tracking with soldier... Brigitte doesn’t give that feeling. All I did was hold M1 and face then enemy, and they would fall. No aim required, no advanced positioning. Stand by the payload and wait for them to come. At the end of the day, I felt cheap for winning with her. 

I’m talking about the sense of pride when you duel with someone. When you shoot the other pharah out of the air. When you’re baby DVa and you knock out Hanzo before he can get a good shot on you. 

Brigitte doesn’t give me that feeling. 

Now to be more objective, let’s discuss her abilities. 

Shield Bash- ridiculously powerful CC, tiny cooldown, can bash at nearly 3x the hit box size of the shield. Yeah, this feels cheap. Let me stun a Reinhardt who’s holding his shield. A man regarded as one of the bravest and strongest heroes in lore. Yeah, some little girl jumps into him and he gets stunned. 

But wait, you say, there are other stuns. Flashbang, for example. But flashbang requires aim, and then it requires decisiveness to aim for the head, and hit it. And if you miss, better pray someone is around to help, because you’re dead if not. 

Brigitte’s stun doesn’t have that problem. You don’t miss, and if you do, only a few seconds and you can try again. Also, you’ll be healing yourself anyway, so don’t worry. 

Let’s move on to the armor pack. An ability that instantly heals almost any character to full hp, and often gives armor. And yeah, don’t have to aim this one either. 

Imagine that zen could instantly heal with his orbs. One orb and you are magically healed instantly. This is the armor pack. And it also recherches very quickly. Now, targets are even harder to kill when Brigitte is throwing armor at them. 

Moving on, the whip shot. Another CC effect. Seriously, a support needs two CC effects? Sounds like overkill. Not to mention it’s range is pretty effective. You have to aim this one a bit more, I’ll give you that. Probably her most balanced effect. But still, it does quite a bit of damage, especially when combined with the shield bash. 

Next on the list is the shield. 600hp and a fast recharge. How are you supposed to kill this person. If you’re not pharah or Junkrat, how do you kill Brigitte, without a team attacking her from all directions? 600 hp is a lot-that’s like killing a DVa before even attacking her. Combined with her other effects and healing, her survivability is massive. 

This post is long enough, so I’m gonna skip over her flail, AOE healing, and ultimate. All of which make her much harder to kill. 

Brigitte has potential to be a lot of fun. But right now, I don’t enjoy playing with her, and I HATE playing against her. She takes up too big a spot in this game, without enough weaknesses. 

This will be downvoted by all the support mains, desperate to defend all healers and their dps abilities.

I would like to finally add that I am practically a Lucio main. I have the most hours on Lucio, with Mercy being my 3rd most played. Healing has been dumbed down every update, and it’s much less fun. Why play Lucio when Brigitte can do everything he can, plus a lot more?

TL;DR: Brigitte needs to change. She isn’t a fun addition. ",Overwatch,1523115726.0,t3_8aiusa

Hanzo's Scatter Arrow does NOT need to be nerfed,"A month or two ago, Blizzard decided to make some changes to Roadhog. Namely, they decided to take a character whose kit is built around doing large amounts of burst damage and neuter his ability to actually do so. Predictably, this reduced Roadhog to an ult-charging battery and transformed him into a virtually unusable hero in competitive.

You'd think that lessons would be learned from this little incident. However, the recent community outcry for Blizzard to nerf Hanzo's scatter arrow shows that we apparently haven't learned a thing, so I would like to address some common complaints about scatter arrow and explain why nerfing it would severely cripple Hanzo and put him squarely in the Roadhog zone of heroes who have nearly lost their entire purpose. Actually, it's really only two complaints which I hear repeated over and over and over again, the first of which is:

**""Hanzo should not be able to one-shot a tank!""**

People make it sound like this is an easy thing to do. There are two tanks in the game that Hanzo can theoretically one-shot; Orisa and Zarya. Let's go over them both. 

There are only two realistic scenarios where a Hanzo is able to one-shot an Orisa; The first being that Hanzo has gotten behind her barrier without her knowledge, the second being that her barrier has been broken and her fortify is on cooldown. Let's start with the first scenario: getting behind the barrier. Hanzo is a terrible flanker. His inadequate mobility leaves him with virtually no means of escaping a fight if he gets noticed, so if you try to be cute and sneak around to try and one-shot that Orisa, you are gonna have a bad time. This means your best bet is to catch her in the time that her barrier AND her fortify is down, which isn't that often of an occurrence if the other team is organized. The simple question I have is, is it really so bad that Hanzo is able to occasionally do this? Is having a counter to a tank really such a terrible thing? It only takes slightly longer for a Reaper to be able to melt through a tank, is he really all that different? I think not.

Then there is Zarya. Let me tell you; I can't count the number of times that I've attempted to scatter a Zarya only for her to bubble herself and steamroll my entire team with her newfound charge. If you are even going to ATTEMPT to scatter a Zarya, you better make damn well sure that her barrier is on cooldown, and that element of risk-reward is more than enough to be balanced. Hanzo does not counter Zarya even though he can potentially one-shot her, and anyone who says so has no idea what they are talking about. 

I'll also touch on the other tanks, such as Winston, who absolutely destroys Hanzo. As I previously mentioned, Hanzo has no real means of escape if he gets dived, so all he can do is try to kill the enemy before they kill him. Good luck trying to scatter a Winston though when he just put his barrier between him and you. Every now and then you'll actually manage to time it well and do some nice damage, but after that? You. Are. Fucked. Hanzo has no other offensive or defensive abilities whatsoever. Once that scatter goes on cooldown, it's just you and your bow, and unless you are at full heath and can nail 3 or so consecutive headshots (not going to happen with his barrier out), you are dead.

Hanzo is not the tank-killing phenom everyone is making him out to be and the state of the current meta clearly reflects that.

This brings us to the second complaint, which is:

**""Scatter Arrow is bullshit; it takes no skill and isn't fun to play against""**

Anyone who has ever played Hanzo knows that this is complete and total horseshit. Landing a perfect scatter arrow is NOT an easy thing to do, and if it was, you would be out there doing it yourself in competitive. Even a slight miscalculation or a poorly-timed jump will lead to negligible damage or a miss entirely, and again, once scatter is on cooldown, all Hanzo has is himself and his bow; nothing else.

I know that being one-shot can be a frustrating feeling, but how is it any different from abilities like Mcree's flashbang? It's okay for Mcree to have an anti-flanker tool, but not Hanzo? Because in case you haven't noticed, without the ability to one-shot flankers, Hanzo would be entirely useless. He would get eaten alive by Tracers, Genjis, and Sombras whose raw damage output is superior in every conceivable way. 

Hanzo's entire kit is built around being able to do high amounts of burst damage, and if you take that away from him, he will be in an even worse state than Roadhog is right now. I find the community outcry around scatter arrow to be shortsighted and a reflection of past frustrations rather than a well-thought-out balancing decision, and I hope I have sufficiently explained why I think that.

This subreddit is already starting to suck,"Super condescending edgy posts and comments such as ""PUSH THE OBJECTIVE,"" or ""I know you're good at cod but your 13 youtube subs mean nothing"" all over this sub and this game has been out less then a week.

Idc if you think bastions not op,  you don't have to tell everyone on here every chance you get so you can sound superior, spoiler alert you just sound smug.

Ok. The fun has died. You can release Sombra now.,"I've absolutely loved watching the community post all their ideas and theories about Sombra. It's been hilarious to see people post everything under the sun and thinking it's somehow related to Sombra. 

But I think the fun is starting to come to a close. I'm actually getting annoyed at all these posts now. People are just getting desperate to find something. It's getting old and Overwatch roster is starting to dry up. 

For me, personally, it's been since release since a new hero has been added. Yes there was Ana, and as a support main, I was really excited about this but I don't think she is any good. Dont get me wrong, I love our Nana and her lore but I'll still pick Zen over Ana any day as an off healer. It just feels wrong needing to ""reload"" my heal ability. Really hurts on healing uptime. I can't tell you how many teammates die because I need to reload. 

I know I can't be the only one who feels this way. Sombra needs to show her face...or mask or whatever. It's time. Come out, come out, wherever you are! 

We are ready. Here's hoping that the 23rd will bring an announcement trailer, Sombra will be added to PTR and released on the 6th with Season 2.


&nbsp;


**EDIT**

This isn't about Ana. This post is about how long the tease has been going on with Sombra. You all need to chill out. I shouldn't have said anything about Ana because apparently Ive triggered so many of you. However, I will not say sorry for my thoughts and opinions. 

I didn't say that Ana doesn't exist. Ana is awesome and is useful in certain situations. Imo, she still could use some buffs. Im not a bad Ana player, I just don't like her play style and thats ok. Ana isn't for everyone. It's nice to see Ana get so much love from people. Blizzard did a fantastic job with her. 

If we are going to fight about a sniper, Id much rather us discuss how terrible dirty Hanzo is. 

However, we all have heros that we like and dislike, who we think are good and bad. I happen to think that Ana isn't particularly special. That is just how I feel about her. I am not saying that you guys are wrong for thinking she is awesome, so you shouldn't go out of your way to be toxic and tell me that I am wrong for how I feel about the game/hero. 

Saying that I am ungrateful, entitled, selfish, crybaby, telling me to go play a different game, etc, is a little much. This is a video game that is suppose to be based around teamwork and making the world a better place. I see no reason in my original post for being hateful towards each other. From reading all of your comments, I will say that some of you really need to be nicer to each other. Not just because we are talking about Overwatch, but just in general. You won't get very far in life if you treat everyone like shit. 

Also, some of you seem to think that I want a new hero every week until we have a roster of 500 heros to pick from. Not the case. Ive logged over 300 hours on Overwatch (a very small 2.5+/- on Ana). As with anything that you do too much, it does become a little boring, so in my eyes the roster is starting to fall on the boring side. I haven't been playing much lately. For me, the Overwatch hype has died quite a bit since launch. 

But in no way did I say that I am the standard by which Blizzard needs to base their game around. I never said that because I am bored, Blizzard NEEDS to release Sombra now. 

The point of this post was to simply point out that the Sombra tease has been going on for quite some time. I am personally ready for Sombra to show her face. I am excited and can't wait to see her. Im sure she will be amazing just like Ana. I hope that she gets released very soon. AND. If not, then I hope that the hints that Blizzard decides to release to us will have more substance. More info about Sombra will help ease the waiting for sure.

For everyone else, it's been nice reading all of your thoughts and ideas about new heros, maps and modes.

I just wanted to take a second to thank the team that booted me from their game the other day.,"Tl:Dr: I just want to thank some guys for booting me from their game for saying ""yo heal a ni**a!"". I've had a surprisingly emotional experience from something as simple as being booted that legitimately changed not only the way I talk, but how I view myself and the privilege that I take advantage of on a daily basis.

I grew up in a VERY WHITE suburb. My friends and I grew up not thinking about things like privilege and racism, because there was nothing else but us and our bubble. Racism was a thing of the past that we were lucky enough to not be a part of. We told horrible (funny) jokes to each other and said things to each other that we wouldn't ever say in front of other people because we knew each others' sense of humor. Fast forward to still saying shit like...quoting South Park and calling my friends ""retard"" and still laughing at/saying things that aren't up to snuff in the 2018 PC wave.

So I was playing a game and I got kicked from a group after winning a few games with these guys for saying ""yo heal a ni**a!"" The game ended and they said ""ok bye loanroller. You can't play with us any more. You said the N Word. Later man."" I was dumbfounded. I went through the entire gamut of rejection. At first, my reaction was disbelief. Like ""pff I can't believe these pussies are so sensitive! What happened to a good ole sense of humor?!"" Then the anger set in. I was so upset that these people would boot ME from their group after crushing so many games for something so stupid as taking my joke the wrong way. 

Then at work tonight it hit me when I was complaining about it (happened two days ago) to a friend and he said ""Good. I would have booted you too. Fuck that man."" I was shocked. I was expecting him to agree with me and say something like ""nah man I know you and I can't believe they thought you were racist"". 

That's not the case at all. I got booted for perpetuating racism and abusing my privilege. I was so upset because someone rubbed it in my face with a swift kick to the nuts. They actually stood up (by booting me) and said (what I want to think they meant) ""Man that's not cool that you say that. You need to realize that you don't know who you're playing with in these games and you don't know who you could be DEEPLY offending with something you just 'think is a funny word.'"" 

There are plenty of people who are legitimately racist in this country and support racist regimes and agendas because they hate people who aren't like them. By saying something like ""ni**a"", I'm not only acknowledging that I'm an idiot, but I'm nodding towards a greater number of hatemongers that want to perpetuate words like these so they stay ingrained in our society. So thank you for booting me. I've really come to terms with a lot of things over the past two days. I've won arguments with you in the shower. Now I just feel shame for saying that shit. I hope people get this message and really take it in. I know it's simple, but for me in this age we live in, it's an important one.

Some input as a software dev on this whole situation,"The whole point of this is to say: spare the devs in the anger directed towards Blizzard. As with most things concerning art in our lives, be it movies, crafts, games - if you give the general worker drone enough time *and* clear direction, they will produce something of beauty.

I don't work in games, but I can tell you that most pieces of software in this world are held by a single strand of spaghetti, some duct tape and a lot of hope. It is a sheer miracle that systems are working as they are across the world without simultaneously blowing up in flames all the time. Of course this happens but not as often as it should, and some very smart devs have worked hard to hold it in place just like Hodor holds doors in Game of Thrones. And this is just regular CRUD apps you see in most places. Videogames are a different beast. They require programming PLUS game physics, sometimes maths, graphics and a whole bunch of other stuff I'm leaving out. It's unforgiving. Change one small variable to fix the sky and BOOM, your horse is now flying underground at mach 3.

Overwatch, then, is one of the greatest engineering feats in gaming I've seen. You have 30+ heroes, each with creative physics interactions, which creates many interesting combinations with each other. Beautiful animations, optimizations. The testing, and gameplay programming involved in this blows my mind. The devs put their soul into this thing. This is why we get so passionate and upset when we see even the slightest bug, why streamers act like they've been hit by lightning when discovering that Cassidy's left nipple is 2 microns too large - because we're used to something super polished. How did this happen? Overwatch 1 devs were given TIME to do their thing, and they were directed well by their leaders. 

And this is also why we rightfully get so disappointed when execs squander the potential of this game with beyond-stupid decisions like wasting years on absolutely nothing, the overpriced shop, etc. It's a disgrace on the hard work of the devs. What a shame. I hope they leave and find employment somewhere else that values their time and work.",Overwatch,1684432642.0,t3_13l5vmw
How could I have carried harder?,"This is the only question you should ask yourself after a loss because it's the only question that matters.

&nbsp;

Figuring out why your Zarya didn't use Graviton Surge when she had it available isn't relevant. Maybe she saw something on her screen that you didn't. Maybe there was a D.Va or Genji in her face, and she didn't want to waste her ult. Maybe she's just plain bad and could have used it, but didn't. None of that matters. The more time you spend thinking of the ways your teammates could have improved is just less time thinking about how *you* could have improved. You can't change others. You can only change yourself, right? Take all that confusion over the loss and point your attention to the only place that you can have any influence...yourself.

&nbsp;

This also applies to games in which you have a thrower. You can't change what someone else is doing...so don't be preoccupied with it. What could *you* have done to carry that game harder? Other players have won 5v6 games...why not you? Just because it isn't easy doesn't mean there's nothing you could do. How could you have carried harder? Did you play your heart out and ""leave everything on the field""? Or did you miss a few shots at a key moment in the team fight? Could you have done more? Or did you ""tap out"" when you realized there was little chance of winning?

&nbsp;

The more honest you are with yourself, the better off you will be. If your answer is...

> ""I carried as hard as I could. There is literally nothing more I could have done to win this game. My team is just too bad.""

Well, that's actually good news. It's probably not true...but even if it were, at least you know you're around the SR at which you belong. A Master level player can, more often than not, carry a Platinum level game regardless of how poorly their teammates play. If you can't do this, you might be playing against players of equal skill. It's never bad to find this out, by the way. It's a good thing to know that you're playing in fair matches. It all stems from being honest with yourself and focusing on the only variable that matters. You.

&nbsp;

**tl;dr** *Ask yourself ""How could I have carried harder?"" and not ""What could my team have done better?"" Even if you're right about what your team could have done better...you can't do anything with that information. Focus on yourself and honestly critique your own abilities and decisions.*

“Rez is so fair”,"I’m an avid mercy hater as a Lucio main, don’t want her in my team or to play against her. She’s fundamentally flawed in 5v5 and either is  just unfun to play into or gets no value. I think mercy straight up needs a rework to be more committal to a fight while keeping here hypermobile pocket play style alive. I think we need to buff ga and have less penalty to ga tech to encourage moving around the battle field to help team mates at crucial moments and not just sit around corners. I think Rez as a concept is good for the game but in its current iteration it just feels cheesy and should be riskier but rewarding, make Rez radius 25% smaller and normal size during valk, also require Los on Rez or it breaks because Rez behind walls has no real counterplay for 90% of the cast. Lower Rez cooldown to 24 seconds to have more rezzes attemptable during a fight too mitigate the risk of committing to it. Blue beam has to go in its current form because requiring other characters to be balanced around blue beam is just unhealthy for the dps cast so let’s tweak blue beam into a small kitsune so you get faster reload by 10%, faster move speed by 10%, and 10% faster fire rate. These changes incentivize more mobile pocketing while not changing break points, more characters in all roles benefit from blue beam now from getting your Ana to cover to getting your genji into position faster to get a kill in the backline, this change makes mercy much more interactive with many more characters without creating issues with one shots. While we’re at it let’s make mercy more engaging and raise the skill floor by buffing healing to 60 heals moreer second but your on a 5 second resource bar that refills by getting blue beam damage done so we lean heavy into pocketing okay styles and discourage heal bots and raise the skill expression of the character. As a lucio main I’m not a fan of mercy and since she’s super popular I want her to be fun to play into and as because I could just say nerf her into the ground but that doesn’t fix the issues with her so we need to strive for a better balance.

I know that railings usually get demolished the millisecond people see them before the round even starts, but sometimes they don't, too. So, it really should be up to the defending team what they decide to do with the railings instead of having that choice made *for them*.   


They should be reset between rounds. It only makes sense. It might not make a huge difference, but there shouldn't be \*any\* difference to the map between rounds. It should be an equal playing field for both teams on both sides.

"I tracked ~100 games of Season 5 ranked on a spreadsheet. Here is what I've discovered: The TRUTH about winners and losers queue, rolling and getting rolled, map win-rates, and more!","tl;dr       

a) winners and losers queue exists. 66% of your ranked games are outside of your control. You will go 10 games winning 7/10 matches, then you will play a series of balanced matches (no more than 10) where you will win 50/50 of your matches, then you will go 10 matches where you will lose 7/10 matches, then you will, again, go 50/50 for no more than 10 matches. Repeat.   

b) Streaks 4+ wins or 4+ losses in a row are uncommon

c) Of 95 games, 60 (63%) were even matches, my team got rolled 22 times (23%, almost 1/4 of all games). And my team rolled the enemy 9 (9% rounded)

d) When you promote, you *will* get rolled 2-3 games before your next rank update.

e) Blizzard is pulling a hard engagement based matchmaking system. But now we know.





[Here is the spreadsheet that I used to track every single game.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12izFhynGzGexrOpPNRm1ab_F3vWE0qp_a6teOUHoFUY/edit?usp=sharing)
 Thanks to u/HarryProtter for the sheet design. Once you open the document, go to the ""input"" tab at the bottom of the spreadsheet to see the tracked progress.

I will now break down each column so you can follow along.         
   
Column A: The Role you played (dps, supp, tank) I wanted to keep everything as stable as possible in my results, so I only queued dps.       

Column B: win or lose      

Column C: The hero you played *the most* that match. Not the *only* hero you played. Every game I will flex to any issues that need addressing. If I spend 51% of the match on tracer, and then I'm getting hard countered, so I swap to phara for the last 49% and win, it will just say ""Tracer"". Some games I swap 2, 3, 4+ times.      
 
Column D: The map that was played         
 
Column E: solo or duo+. I only solo'd to keep my results clean.      

Column F: ignore. Its just for tracking specific members if you group up.      
  
Column G: The date and time of the match.      

Column H: rank updates     

Column I: If the match was even, if we got rolled, or if we rolled. 

and Column J: Which is just misc notes


Now that you know what you're looking at, let's get into the JUICE: 

**STARTING WITH COLUMN A** - you will see 4 color codes: White, purple, orange, and grey. The purple columns represent ""winners queue"", and the orange columns represent ""losers queue"". White columns are sections that were 50% wins and 50% losses, and the one grey zone was *almost* a winners queue but it was cut off by a loss on each end, which leads to your question:     

""How did you determine if you were in winners queue or losers queue?""

I took a measurement of 10 games. If you won 7/10, you're in winners queue. If you lose 7/10, you're in losers queue. That's it. I chose 7/10 because 6/10 didn't feel strict enough to be considered a win/loss queue, so I upped it to 70%+. 

If you look, you will notice a trend: White > purple > white > orange > repeat (grey was almost a purple, and the white section beneath the grey was almost an orange.)

It clear that *winners and losers queue exists*. Let's say you're winning half of your games, then you suddenly win 7/10 games. You're in winners queue! Then you will continue to win 50% of your matches for the next 10 games (or less). And then you *WILL* hit a loser's queue. Guarantee. Then you will go back to winning 50% of your games, and the cycle repeats itself.   

When you are in winners queue, you're basically getting carried for some of those games. Notice how during all of my winners queues, my team did not get rolled a single time. Also note the opposite is true. That when you're in losers queue, your team will get rolled hard more often than not, and your team will never roll one game in that 10 game span of losers queue.

Read column J of row 33 for a breakdown of the trend as I noticed it.

TAKE AWAY: The data shows that once you get out of your losers queue, the time to climb is the 10 fair games between streaks. That's when you should be really sweating and trying to win. Because the win and loss queue is coming within 10 games, you need to win as many of those fair (white) matches as you can. THAT'S the time to climb.



**NOW COLUMN C** - You will see two color codes. Green and maroon. These represent streaks. A streak was winning or losing 4 or more games consecutively. I wanted to make it a point that winners *queue* and a win *streak* were two separate things. You can win 4 games in a row but that does NOT mean that you are in winners queue, and vice verse. I chose 4+ games in a row because 3 isn't surprising and happens often as you can see. But winning or losing 4 games or more in a row is a trend, so I chose 4.

TAKE AWAY: The reveal is that streaks are actually uncommon, or at least more uncommon than I was led to believe. At least for season 5. Only 3 times total did I win or lose 4+ games in a row out of 95 matches. 14 games in total meaning that I was in a win or loss streak a total of 14% of my games. Some may say that's a lot, others may say its a little. 




**COLUMN H AND RANK UPDATES**  

A trend I noticed is that once I got promoted, I was guaranteed to face a series of stomps before my next rank update. Which the sheet shows. Anytime I got promoted to Diamond 4 FROM diamond 5 (not stagnation, but promotion) I got punched in the dick. 2, 3, or even 4 HARD rolls before I could complete my next 5 wins, which resulted in me being demoted back to dia 5. (See rows 58-68, and 26-40). 

TAKE AWAY: If you promote, you're going to get shit on. Period. Whether this is to test you or Engagement based matchmaking at work to keep you playing, or what ever you want to say it is, your next rank update is going to be a struggle. Once you update again after that promotion, you're back in the cycle of winners queue for 10 games > even matches for 10 games > losers queue for 10 games > even matches for 10 games > repeat, until you win more than you lose during the even matches. 


**COLUMN I. ROLL OR GET ROLLED?**     

First, I want to note that I was actually very strict on what I considered a ""roll"". A roll means that Team A shit on Team B and there wasn't a chance of winning that match. E.g: one team could barely hold a point for more than 10% in the entire game. Or one team won almost every single team fight and pushed the payload without much contest. Or one team couldn't even get a single tick. A roll for me is just an absolute mismatch in the ranking. 
An ""even"" game does NOT mean your teammate wont play junk into a flying comp and die repeatedly. It means that, even though he *is* doing that, somehow your game still went to 5 rounds and overtime. That's still even. Both teams pushed and pulled the objective in their favor. 

Games, where my team rolled, are in blue. The games where my team got rolled are in red. Games that were fair / even are in white.

To note, all rolls are a team diff, not just a support diff or just a tank diff. However, having a bad tank on team A means that Team B can just do what they want because they have infinite space, so the line can be blurry. I used my best judgement and tried to really see if it was just a tank diff or an actual team diff. Due to how strict I was on how I defined a roll, I'd say that I was pretty accurate on not just tossing tank diffs into the rolled section. In winners queue, you will roll or be even. In losers queue, you will get rolled, or be even. You will not roll the enemy if you are in losers queue a single time, and vice vers. So if you're getting stomped back to back, and you haven't been promoted recently, you're in losers queue. Track your games, wait out your 7 losses, and then go hard and play as best as you can to climb.

TAKE AWAY: Of 95 games, 60 (63%) were even matches, my team got rolled 22 times (23%). And my team rolled the enemy 9 (9% rounded). Almost every roll was either in losers queue, or in the next 5 wins needed for a rank update. 





**RANDOM NOTES**
I dominate push maps. 76.9% win rate. I also dominate escort maps. 60.6% win rate

I blow at control maps. 36.8% win rate. And Hybrid. 40%.

Busan, in particular, is cursed. Every loss was a roll and I only won 1 game on it. Busan is literally single-handedly tanking my control win rate. But what can I do, they're all stomps.

I've never lost a game on Esperance or New queen street.

I win 60% of my games between 15:00 - 17:59 local, and 55% of my games between 12:00 and 14:59. 

18:00-20:59 is the worst time to play. 44% win rate. 



In the end, it seems that we're right about winners queue, and being forced to stay in your rank. Blizzard is pulling a hard engagement-based matchmaking system. It's not 50/50. 66% of your ranked games are outside of your control (unless you're smurfing hard or are T500, in which case you're so good that it doesn't matter what the matchmaker throws at you, you will carry)",Overwatch,1689537461.0,t3_151fufz

I think the mercy nerf was warranted,"I just want to preface that I am a masters support player, mainly lucio kirko and bap, but I dabble in mercy. I genuinely think this last patch was a good one for mercy, mercy has very powerful abilities but the issue is you cannot kill her, it’s super unfun to fight, if you have an Ana mag dumping an Orisa, of course the Orisa never dies, so you dive the Ana, if you tried to dive mercy she just flew off, she requires very little skill to get good at and of course characters like sojourn need nerfing but you could even stick a mercy to a Cas and even he would run through teams if he was playing well. They say she is more unfun to play but that was the argument against nerfing hog and look how that went. You have to look at how it is to fight, it is unfun, and no skill. While damage boost and rez are strong, we have other strong abilities on supports but you can actually kill then like anti, sleep, and discord.

The game is declining in popularity because Blizzard tries too hard to make it competitive while still being too soft on uncompetitive and bad players.,"I think part of the problem is that the community always comes up with excuses as to why we can't implement things that will help the greater good.

------------------------------------------------------
**Examples:**

Can't have a votekick system, people might kick bad players

Can't have an 'avoid this player' system because it might hurt off meta players

Can't ban one tricks because they just want to play differently

People hate the auto-ban system because it might hurt off meta players

Can't have a scoreboard because it might make bad players feel bad

Can't have a low priority queue because it might give off meta players/ OTP's a higher queue time

Can't have a role queue system because people might abuse it

Can't have a player draft matchmaker because nobody would pick one tricks/ off meta mains

Can't have win based SR below plat because there might be smurfs (I'm not even sure why this one exists, if people wanted to keep smurfing they would just throw/ soft throw until they get back to their smurf level)

Can't have a CSGO- style overwatch system because people might abuse it

Can't force people to use mic/ be in voice chat because someone might call them bad.

---------------------------------------------

The community and game in general is held back by extreme minorities who ruin the game for others, and everyone feels a need to defend them *(See- about 40-50% of people on this sub, 95% of people on the forums, Blizzard banning pros and regular players alike for reporting one tricks)*.


The only thing that a lack of these systems does, as IoStux said in one of his videos, is create entitled and toxic players. 

-----------------------------------------

You can't see who on your team is really doing shit, because the scoreboard might hurt bad players' feelings. 

**So it turns into a blame game with people bragging about unverifiable medals.**

--------------------------------------------

You can't avoid racist/mysogynistic/griefing/abusive players on your team, because god forbid people don't want to play with a Symmetra one trick.

**So it turns into a toxic cesspool.**

----------------------------------------------

You can't report/ban OTPs even if they're borderline feeding/throwing because they just want to play differently.

**So it turns into a 5v6 unless you want to sacrifice your own enjoyment to babysit a one trick.**

----------------------------------------------

**And so on.**

------------------------------------------------

My biggest fear is that it's too late. That no matter what Blizzard does now, the game will never even come close to the popularity and praise it received in its first 6 months-year. I've never seen a game that has dropped in popularity like this. From **game-of-the-year awards on multiple massive game review sites and magazines** to **4+ minute queue times on special events that give you free CP.** That's not normal. And the issue is not the game becoming stale- Blizzard is making pretty good map/hero releases and balance patches (except mercy and junkrat).

Blizzard, if you're reading this, you've created an amazing game with a nice diverse cast and generally great and fun gameplay. But the competitive system, and your neglect towards implementing systems for the greater good is killing your own game and turning it into a toxic cesspool that just makes more players toxic, and in turn makes more players want to quit. The report system has seen improvements, but it's not enough on its own. Unless people are being banned within 10-20 minutes of a report, it will never be enough.

I have played this game for hundreds of hours. I've been from Bronze to Diamond. I've seen 98% of what the game has to offer. And yet I want to quit not because of stale gameplay, stale heroes or stale map pool, but because **everything is so out of my control.** 

-----------------------------------------------

I can't do anything about toxic/abusive players except report and hope that they get banned. I have to deal with them for the rest of the match and take a loss, and then hope that they're not on my team next game with the ever-shrinking player pool.

I can't do anything about leavers, both on my team or the other team. I have to tank a load of SR/ watch the match get cancelled after I actually get a good team for once and we pull off a nutty play.

I can't do anything about one tricks except take a loss and hope they're not in my next game.

I can't do anything about throwers except take a loss and hope they're not in my next game.

I can't do anything about bad/poorly coordinated teammates except take a loss and hope they're not in my next game.

I can't do anything about having 6 dps mains/ 6 mercy mains/ two of the same character one trick on my team except take a loss and hope they're not in my next game.

----------------------------------------------

Blizzard, please do something about the shitty state of the game and more specifically comp. Everyone says that the issue is that the playerbase is shitty, but that isn't the issue. The issue is the lack of action against the shitty players and allowing their shittyness to go on.

**For a game so centred around teamwork, there's remarkably little we can do about poor teamwork.**

---------------------------------------------------

Thoughts?


**EDIT:** Before anyone says it, stacking is not always a viable option. When it works it's amazing, but most of the time you can't find a full 6 stack/ can't find a fair match in the tiny playerbase since you're restricted to playing against other 6 stacks.

The problem isn't that the *entire* team is from a different location that the team's location/city. The problem is that there are ZERO players from the team's city. They don't want the *whole* team roster to be local players, but a few at the least.

Currently, the Premier League does not have a maximum restriction on the number of foreign players allowed on a team, but does require at least eight homegrown players.

**There's two main goals/reasons for this rule. The first being that it will allow local players/talent to build and improve. The second reason was because the local fans wanted to see the local players be in the games... which allowed the local players to build and improve.**

Blizzard is not forcing you to buy them. The entire game is [aside from cosmetically] available to you for $39. No paid DLC. No free hero rotation.

Edit 2: While looking at the replies of a lot of players, I do now see the point that spending money on RNG does suck. I was mainly addressing low drop rates through playing games to unlock things.

"Illari is not OP, she's probably the most well balanced Hero launch so far in OW2.","I've seen a lot of posts talking about how OP Illari is and how to nerf her, and I keep wanting to comment smh, so instead of playing another ranked match while just shy of being tilted, I cracked a beer and this way too effing long post so I can move on(hopefully)  

**Much Needed TLDR at the end. Cheers!**

Based on in game chat and post on reddit and twitter, it seems many believe Illari is this unstoppable force that needs a damage nerf instantly. 

She's not OP, but her kit is built perfectly to have her appear OP and cause frustration in quickplay.

I think there's also a bit of recency bias when compared to how insanely weak Lifeweaver was at launch. 

First lets remember what OP at launch is. 

OP is Ramattra at launch with his never ending ult. 

OP is Sojourn at launch. Basically Soldier76 -heals + greater burst escape tech/better vertical mobility, + an Aoe damage orb that also caused slow. Then they said: ""**Hey, what if she was also Widowmaker?**"" *Wait, like wall hack ultimate?*  ""**No, her sniper shot, but don't worry she won't have Zoom!""**   *Huh? Then how is she like widow, not like 300dmg headshot out to 100meters?* ""No, of course not."" *Great, I was worried she could 1 tap all dps and supports, sounds like she may be rough for tracer though lol.* ""**Well. . .she will have 260dmg headshot potential**."" *Wait, so she can one tap all supports and dps. . . please tell me short distances, no way a buffed soldier type character can 1 tap anyone not tank out to mid range ""***Not mid range . . .70 meters""** *Ah wtf.* 

Like seriously, erase Lifeweaver from your memory, and remember life against sojourn 1 shots without needed a mercy pocket on anything but tank. That was OP.  That was oppressive. Ramattra's ult literally could just keep going that was insane. 

Illari's kit does lend itself to seeming OP in the realm of Quickplay  and so recent after launch. The lack of coordination and lack of understanding of how many counters she has by itself increases this perception.  Yeah, without a counter, her ult is insane, but she has many counters. Then add in that MMR gap is wide enough that any character can seem OP when high mmr is up against lower mmr. In quickplay the mmr gap is wide enough that a higher ranked player can frag out and make Lifeweaver look like he needs a nerf. 

Her ultimate is super cool, and can punish lack of coordination but countering her ult is very doable. That's why I think  the idea of nerfing the damage is not on the table, at most maybe something we won't see, at the very least until we see how it plays out in ranked for a while. But I don't suspect the damage is too much. Why, how much she can be countered. 

1. Counters: The ult is Channeled for 1.2 seconds, which gives a decent amount of time to counter with the stuns/knockback/hacks,  then it's a projectile and there's time to counter by eating it, then the projectile creates and status effect that can be phased/cleansed etc. That is three phases that each have 3 ""styles"" that can counter it. I believer her ult might have the most counters of any hero(could be wrong)

* Orisa, 2  counters can eat and stun,  Sig 2 counters eat and knock down, Dva DM eat, Brig Rally stun, Kiri Suzu, Zarya bubs, Hog hook, Zen ult, Lucio ult, Genji can deflect it back, ana sleep . . .LW tree??? I might me missing something.

Once she gets into ranked, the crazy PoG ults without counters will decrease dramatically. 

Lastly on her ult, the damage isn't the real utility. Initial damage is minimal 50-55. I see that she's looked at as having this crazy damage dealing ult, but the real power is the potential of the triggered damage + Slow. It demands resources which free's up for follow up Suzu/tp is often held for. With respect to supports nade/sleep and discord, but a Illari ult that lands during a fight demands it, freeing up not only that other support utility but also other Tank/Dmg ult and abilities. 

And that's the counter I've noticed the most personally, Suzu before the final explosion.

So anticipating that demand for resources is key to combo with Illari ult. I'm not sure how I feel about this since it is an ult and not an ability, but it very much is not OP. 

Another thing I've been seeing a lot of:

*Why did they make a HEALER with an ult that doesn't heal?  Why why does primary have so much damage focus, nerf her headshot below the 150 breakpoint(*spoiler her HS is 112.5) *etc* 

ML7 enter the chat: ""Support not healer."" 

1. Neither Bap window or Kiri rush directly heal. They affect healing with cooldowns or boost, yes. Bap window doubles both healing and damage equally.  At launch people were saying the same thing about Kiriko's ult(why does a ""healer"" have this). 
2. While Illari's ult doesn't heal, the concept of it isn't an extreme step from the current precedent when you consider many of the support hero's most valuable utility doesn't have to do with healing. 
3. Her primary fire: I am honestly am shocked how many times I've seen people asking for her damage to be nerfed to it below  the 150 headshot breakpoint. Her headshot damage multiplier is 1.5. Her headshot damage is 112.5 not 150. It's the same as Kiri
4. If they nerfed her primary damage, they're basically saying that projectile support damage gets priority. Kiri headshot after nerf does the same damage at 112.5 and Kiri can get two in the span it takes Illari to get one. 
   1. In reality I think her primary is a perfect counter balance to Kiri's kunai right now and rewards hitscan mechanics while Kiri rewards projectile. 
5. Her primary takes 1 second to charge, and charge is paused when healing. This means to maximize she will need a heal damage rhythm like Bap. if her turret is on cooldown, her heal potential is actually really weak. Sure, she does 120/second but if maxed out at 3 seconds, goes on cool down, so a heal shoot rhythm is a must. 
6. Also **Zenyatta** and **bap** do insane weapon damage and Zen's primary utility is a damage amplification. Bap has insane damage potential without affecting his healing potential.
7. Also Mercy. A Mercy focusing on healing is literally a Mercy that doesn't know how to properly use her. It's why the Damage boost debate is such a hot one. She is literally only valuable when utilizing her dmg boost while pocketing a dps. 
8. Also, Lucio, why is lucio often meta? Speed boost, it's not his aoe heals. Brig has better AOE heals than him. It's his speed boost, and ability to zoom around and harass. Without lucio speed everyone around there would be no rush comp. 

Her turret: 

1. If there is anywhere I suspect a nerf to come first, I actually think this is it. I don't think it will be the healing output. 50hp/s is solid, but being single target it's not like throwing this into the chaos of a dive or brawl is op. Great for poke I suspect. I could see a longer cool down when not destroyed, to adjust how fast it can be redeployed to maybe slow down a poke and progress place forward to another position situation as advancing, but who knows. Too soon to tell how much this will matter though. 
2. Everyone complains about Phara/Mercy. She is viable option now help with that without sacrificing the healing aspect too much. While bap and ana are good supports for helping with this, Illari can have a higher impact. Her turret can be placed high up behind cover thus keeping it away from her splash and allowing dps and her to poke from cover. This is decent addition for the phara/mercy balance, I think. Also, not saying it's a fix, or is commentary on the mercy damage boost debate, but just pointing out additional value for Illari here and why I think she's good for over all balance. .

The dps perspective:

While I'm sure there will be a ton of Support players that love her, I think one of the goals with the design of Illari is to create more cross role play out of the dps categyr. That is, I think she was designed to bring the dps player with a play style profile like mine over to support more often. Not saying this in a bad way, I think it's a good thing, not just because I like playing her but also for the health of the game. Why would they do this? 

LONG ASS QUE TIMES for one.

Que times are longest because there are less people queuing for support.  Personally, I don't find support to be the most difficult of the roles(personal experience and not said as commentary ), but for me it is the LEAST fun. 

So why can Illari help with Que times. She speaks to a player base that hasn't had a character that fits with they're style, and thus doesn't branch over to support often. Basically, she gives the dopamine to us hitscan dps players(I'll address bap and ana)

I main main Ashe, which actually means I play Ashe like 50-60% of the time and throw in Cas/widow or others situationally. Sometimes I like to go into the backline and cause chaos with tracer or sombra. Flats explained this perfectly in his ""what your main says about you tier list."" 

While I main dps, I play a fair amount of tank depending on my mood. I enjoy tank, and its fun when I want to play it. Support though, I mainly play it to get better at dps and tank. It's helped me work on my positioning and overall understanding of the game so. But I never play support because I'm in the mood to. None of the heroes give me that dopamine hit the same way. I know that Bap is hitscan, and I do play a little of him but the style of his burst doesn't seem to do it for me at least, and I do play Ana but without the headshots it just doesn't quite do it for me.

As someone that is at home with the semi auto hitscan feel. . .

I effing love this character. Not even in a ""I like her *for* a support way,"" I think she's baseline really fun to play. Support is full of heroes that reward good projectile aim(and even no aim), but some of us suck at or just don't like projectile but we love hitscan. . . What can I say, best feeling in game is when flicks are on point and I'm cracking headshots. Sometimes a change of pace sounds good though. I've heard many people that are great on Kiri say they suck at hitscan. I am atrociously bad at Kiri' kunai and not great with projectile. I suspect there's a lot of hitscan players that never touch support for this reason even if they want to switch it up. 

And lets be real, the more cross role play time people have, the better they understand team roles as a whole which is better for the games quality of life. Playing other roles helps with understanding why that ana didn't heal you. (Because she was staying in safe cover and you bolted out of LoS suddenly) <----Real life example of mine.  Obviously  with all of this I'm just talking about my own perspective, but as someone who's main role style fits with hers yet adds variety for being a support character, it makes sense to think she will bring some players into support que. 

Anyways long effing post. 

TLDR:

Her seeming OP is deceptive due to  of coordination for countering and the very wide MMR gaps found in QP. 

For a Hero at launch,  she is very fun, and surprisingly balanced. This will be seen more as people understand her counters and she get's played in ranked. 

Headshot is not150, it's **112.5** same as Kiri but twice as slow.  

Zenyatta and Bap do insane damage. Zen right click has the ""feel"" of one shot potential. 

Her ult utility isn't the crazy team wipe PoGs so far seen in quickplay.  Her ult has a bunch of counters due to being channeled but also a projectile and also an effect/trigger damage. More counters than any ult in game?

Her ult being damage focus isn't without precedent. Kiri Rush, and Window(50/50). 

The idea of damage focus makes sense when looking at other damage focus found in support. Mercy without dmg boost is useless. Lucio zooms=non-healing utility, oh moira dps. 

Cheers

A top 500 player was the sweetest to me yesterday,"This post is long and nothing important but I just wanted to share. I'm just a girl trying to play on console as a healer main. Some days, I have boys screaming ""REZ ME REZ ME"" in my ear. Or I even got told by a 12 yr old ""Oh wow ___is a girl."" When I said I was a healer main, he said ""a girl and a healer main? Same thing"". Anyway, I was having a terrible time trying to climb as Lucio only so I decided try going Mercy after watching some Youtube vids of Master Mercy players on console. I'm just a lowly diamond player at 3,100 but for some reason I got placed last night in a team with one master, one top 500 player, and the rest of us were diamonds. We were against a team of 3 masters and 3 diamonds. Both teams had a Bastion so it was really a battle of Mercy Bastion and Rein. The enemy team was able to get it to the end with a minute left.

When we were picking our heroes, I waited to see what support my team mates wanted me to pick. Top 500 player as clicks Mercy several times to indicate he wanted me to play her. In spawn, he went up to me as Zarya and sprayed Sorry at my feet. I used my Mercy clap emote and said Hello. He then said Thank you.

When we attacked, my team mates were all doing what they could to protect me, always looking back to where I was and not leaving my side. I played really well as Mercy, flying everywhere, hiding and getting big 3-4 man rezes to negate the enemy ult. We stomped the enemy team and got it with 3 minutes left.

In round 3, the enemy team couldn't even get it to the first point. In our spawn room, he went up to my character and faced me and said Thank you. And in the end, I got potg and all my team mates voted for me. In the end, he even messaged me and said I deserve a higher rank.

Sick of '5dps meta' in QP,"Ok, I know someone will say 'lol its just qp' or 'qp is for fun' but there is a line.

Basically I play a lot of qp and the last week or so I feel that nearly every game has at least 4 or 5 dps players and its to a point where its getting riddiculous.

Like just now I joined a game where 5dps instalocked and I was left to try and solo tank without a healer while nobody in the team thought to switch.

I know QP is fun but the fact so many games end up with 4 or 5 dps instalocks is making the games poor quality and unplayable and if I keep leaving 5dps teams I eventually get an exp penalty so its like I can't seek good games even if I want them.

Has anyone else been experiencing this in qp recently, as I feel recently it has gotten much worse to the point where 3/4 qp games I play in a session will be 4/5 dps teams.",Overwatch,1500301567.0,t3_6nte29
"Level 25 for competitive is too low, and could actually put new players off playing it.","Now before you fly off the handle, and say I'm shutting out casual players etc...

At level 25 I had a very limited knowledge about everything in the game, at 25 you have probably just got to grips with how the game works, the game modes and how counters work and what heroes each hero counters.

I think level 35/40 should be the minimum at the very least, that means they have 10/20 more hours of experience and this will be beneficial to the ranked system plus the people within it as it is extremely frustrating at the minute having someone who is literally level 25, rushing into ranked and not really having that much game knowledge making it harder for that team, I even had one guy ask why we had a level 5 on our team when it was level 25 for ranked.. he was level 105.

So yeah, please raise the bar for comp, it will help the ranked system and it's players while also giving new players a chance to learn the game without people getting bitter towards them because they don't have the game sense or knowledge to fully understand what to do.

Gotta say this - shit posts are getting worse.,"At least put some effort into it, and stop with the childish borderline NSFW shit like S76 raping a sleeping hero or sucking handsoap off.  I'm talking about the current trending post of Zenyatta's lines ending with bitch currently cresting over 3.5k upvotes.  People say 'just downvote and move on', and I did, but that's not the point - someone thought it was humorous to add 'bitch' to the end of every one of Zen's lines, packaged it up into a post and people are snapping it up like it's going out of style.  Meanwhile we had posts of fanart or actual gameplay discussion get less upvotes, or get outright downvoted, and people are okay with this?

I mean, I don't mind POTGs where all I see is a Mercy ressing 4 or 5 people.   At least someone got it and was proud enough of it to post it to this sub, just like the other POTGs where Genji slices and dices the whole team, Dva wipes everyone, Orisa uses halt so that Rein can Earthshatter under the enemy shield, etc. Likewise, I've seen some real quality posts on here - example, a chalk-drawn Zenyatta at a tea shop.

"(Unpopular Opinion) Roadhog wasn't OP, the people complaining about him just suck.","I think that the nerf was unnecessary. Strangely enough, I get more kills now than I did pre-nerf, with pretty much all my stats remaining the same. (Yesterday I had three competitive games where I got 50+ kills with him, pre-nerf I'd be lucky if I got one game with 40+) But now he's just annoying to play as. It's been an adjustment but I still manage. I just don't understand what everybody's worked up about. Like wow, you're mad that he can one shot you? Like, just move away from him and don't go near him. Switch to Reaper, D.Va or in some cases Zarya and Mccree if you want to get up close and shred him. Or you could stay away from him and shoot him from afar with Soldier, Pharah, Widow, Hanzo or Zen. I'm starting to think that the reasons for the nerf were less to do with him being actually unfair and more to do with people just complaining because they can't beat him and they want him to be brought down to their level. Instead of attempting to counter him and actually best him they would rather complain to Blizzard about it being ""unfair."" It's not unfair, maybe the people complaining just aren't very good at the game, because maybe I'm alone here, but I don't think Roadhog is really that difficult to kill. I've had more trouble killing D.Vas, Winstons, and even characters like Mei and Symmetra if they are escape artists. Needless to say I think there should be a change to benefit him, maybe not putting him back the way he was, but I think Blizzard is doing the right thing potentially increasing his survivability. Right now he just feeds enemy ults, which leads to one too many Mercy Rezes. Don't get me wrong I'm not a pro at the game nor do I try to act like I know the ins and outs of the game, but I've truly never had major issues killing Roadhog. I've had major trouble killing really good Genjis, Widows, Symmetras and even Meis in the past, but I've never had an enemy Roadhog destroy me in the same way they have. Does this mean that we should nerf them in the same way that Roadhog was? We shouldn't, not to the same degree at least, even though I think Symmetra is a tad bit more unfair than Roadhog was. I don't think we should be calling for powering down of certain heroes just because we have a poor outing against one of them.  ",Overwatch,1500080376.0,t3_6nd4w2
Illari’s ult lowkey sucks?,"Okay, so as a disclaimer, I’m aware that this is probably a skill diff on my part, but I struggle to get value out of Illari’s ult. I 100% understand that the potential to get a 3k or more with her ult is there, but I just feel like you have to have all the stars align in order to get that. 

I think the barrier blocking nerf was a big hit to her ult power level. 

Suzu, wraith, fade, and Zarya bubble all cleanse her ult. 
Dva, Orisa, and Sigma can eat it.
Winston, Rein, Sigma, Brig can shield against it.
Immortality and life grip can keep someone alive even when detonated. 
Lucio, Zen, and Lifeweaver ult can deny it.
You can get stunned/hacked out of your ult too.
Lastly, if you trying to single one person out who doesn’t have a cleanse ability, they can just get pocketed by any healer, and get healed through it. 

Waiting out key cooldowns is the obvious answer, but at some point, it feels like you’re gonna wait forever to be able to use it and get some type of value. The only time I get real value with her ult is when the fight is basically already won.

I to be opposed to people booing at Blizzcon. My opinion has changed completely after the absolutely insulting events that transpired against the community today.,"The ARG itself, an official blog post, and the Los Muertos skulls, we were pretty sure something huge would happen today, the 1st. Instead, Blizzard decided to shit all over the community with yet another timer into a timegate. When the idea of booing Blizzard for announcing Sombra at Blizzcon came to be, I thought it would be a dick move. I figured they were working hard on her and she'd be out before Blizzcon anyway. Then the 1st Lumerico.mx timegate happened... then the next... now this one. After this (probably, though it's hard to say at this point) final timegate, I feel that booing Blizzard for something this pathetic is acceptable. Not because they didn't get her out 2 months ago and I'm an impatient little shit, but because this ARG has taken the loyal community members dedicated to solving this thing and drug them directly through the fucking mud. I spoke to 2 different people in-game today that said they took off work so they could get involved with what they BOTH called ""the final part of the ARG."" They're not to blame either. Blizzard led us all on with the massive amount of talk and hype surrounding November 1st. Even I thought something might happen, whether it be a PTR update with her or just a cool trailer for her featuring teasers of her abilities/lore. I should've expected just another ""thanks, now sit the fuck down and wait to be fucked again!""

Overwatch 2 is better than Overwatch 1," I feel like any time something is posted about ow2 it's just complaining about balance, monetization, or how ow1 was just so much better, but ow2 is WAY better than ow1 was at the end of its life.

I played ow1 since launch and it was great in the beginning, but towards the end it was awful. The fact that ow2 brought the game back to life easily makes up for how monetized it is now, imo. Does it have the perfect free to play model? No, but I'd argue it's not the worst out there. $20 for a skin is dumb, but it's no different from Valorants insane skin prices. And at the end of the day, that's just cosmetic.  
Putting new heroes half way through the battle pass is questionable, but it doesn't take an insane amount of time to unlock, and if you only play once a week, then you can either buy the battle pass or wait until the next season when you can unlock them through a challenge.

People need to remember that Blizzard is a company whose goal is to make money. If they're not making any, then it's not worth putting effort into for them, and the game will be abandoned like ow1 was. This new free to play system isn't as great as getting everything right away like it was when ow1 first came out, but I'm just happy to have consistent updates/balance patches/and content back in the game.",Overwatch,1673278576.0,t3_107hd7x
"If expensive skins get us more content, who cares.","I know there's a lot of hate for Blizzard at the moment making legendary skins cost $20. I get it - it's predatory and overpriced for a skin. 

But... Overwatch has lacked updates for so long while other F2P games like Apex Legends / Fortnite are constantly getting new heroes, maps, cinematics, events. Their skins cost a shitload - an Apex heirloom can cost hundreds - but I've never bought any and get to enjoy that game's content and updates for free. 

Overwatch will be the same way. I know the argument is that we paid for the game already, but I personally paid $60 for the game like five years ago. If I were to calculate how much each hour of gameplay has cost me, it would be so small that it would be ridiculous.

Make Brigitte unable to shield bash after her shield has been destroyed until it is restored completely (or x%).,"Reading the post about upcoming changes, and devs seem to have trouble balancing her. Increasing shield bash cooldown was all they found apparently.

Everyone has played a fair amount of time against her and the most frustrating thing in my opinion is destroying her shield only to get stunned a very short time after because she can use it after it regenerates 20hp... paired with the brainless combo offered by her kit, it quickly becomes the worst.

This has to go. Make her rechage full (or x amount) before allowing a bash. It will force Brigitte players to choose between being able to bash, or protecting themselves to the last hp of their shield, and penalise those who use it carelessly to approach from too far.

Forget advancing the lore for a second: the DVA short fails on a far more fundamental level than that,"I've seen a lot of criticism, and far more defense, of the latest short which completely misses the mark. People arguing about whether we learned enough about DVA or the situation in Korea or what have you...that doesn't matter.

What matters is that, unlike every other short so far, we saw no kind of character or plot *progression*. By which I mean, DVA had no arc - she ends the short in exactly the same place, mentally and physically, she started it in.

Every other short has characters go through some experience which has an effect on them. That's *basically* what any story, whether it's Pride and Prejudice or Marge vs the Monorail, actually is. Rein learning his hard lesson about being a shield tank is the most obvious example, but it applies across the board; Winston has a brush with danger which he must overcome and leaves him inspired to send out the recall. Bastion finds an alternative to violence through Ganymede. Alejandra finds a renewed sense of hope after encountering a real-life hero (remember, Soldier isn't the protagonist of his short).

DVA though? She's already a MEKA pilot here, which we knew. A story about the formation of MEKA could have been interesting - former gamers getting their first harsh taste of real combat - but no. She begins this story as a hero who fights omnics, and what does she do? She fights some omnics. That's it. That's what happens. They *tried* to shoehorn an arbitrary ""learn to work together"" thing in lieu of an arc, but it didn't land - just a couple of throwaway lines which felt like an afterthought. DVA doesn't have any development here, she doesn't learn any lesson or overcome any new challenge, doesn't find any hitherto untapped inner strength - there's no *journey* for her. Ignore lore or background worldbuilding for a second, this simply fails to be a story.

"Keep quick play is it is now, but add ""unranked comp"" with hero limits as its own game mode.","I'd rather they switch ""No Limits"" with current QP. I'm all for having one-hero limits in an unranked gamemode, but this isn't the best way to do it. As many people are speculating, No Limits is going to just be people six-stacking the same hero. If in current quick play, you ended up having 2 Zaryas or 2 McCrees, it  would normally stop at that because people were trying to actually play the game. If you're relegating No Limits into the same area as goofy shit like brawls, people are going to go into that mode with the express purpose of stupid 6-stack comps.

It seems much more reasonable to keep the current hero limit as it is, and move the hero-limit unranked game mode into its own area. That way, people who want to actually try in QP can avoid the ""it's just QP bro just play ranked"" crowd, but not at the expense of team-comp variety in normal QP. 

Tl;Dr. Keep current quick play as it is, and make hero-limit QP its own game mode. You'd give an option to the crowd who want unranked comp, but you wouldn't be forcing it down the throat of people that want to 2-stack in quick play.",Overwatch,1478388664.0,t3_5bcvbq

Why B.O.B deserves a nerf,"I love the sexy mustached bastard. But hear me out.

Almost every powerful DPS ult in the game has a downside or requires skill to be beneficial. Junk and Pharah are immobile when using their ults, McCree and Reaper are almost immobile. Doom has an indicator where he will land. Genji has to dive and expose himself. Soldier needs to be in the right position and gets countered hard by shields and matrix. You get the picture. 

B.O.B. is different. He can be called in from anywhere, has no startup, has 1200 health, does 112 damage per second, has a maximum 10 second lifetime, and Ashe can still move and shoot while he is in play. It's basically an old level 3 Torb turret with 2x the health pool, a 100 damage uppercut, the ability to be healed, bubbled, nanoed, transcended, and Lucio beated, and can contest point, and sticks around when the player dies.

Now I know what you are thinking.

> ""Just aim at him and kill him 4Head""

That's great. A few problems. One is that his very presence makes the team fight a 7v6. Attention given to dealing with him is attention you are not giving to your enemies who are healing up, shooting you, and now outnumbering you. Two is that shooting B.O.B. gives you no ult charge, so have fun using cooldowns on him. Three is that the best way to deal with him is to be behind a shield, yet his charge ability throws you (or your shield tank) up into the air and naturally scatters the team. Maybe this will be fleshed out over time.

> ""Just sleep him or hack him 4Head""

You can sleep nearly every hero ult in the game, and hack half of them. And usually sleeping or hacking those heroes lands you a kill. If your Sombra or Ana crowd control B.O.B., then awesome, now you get to go back to a 6v6 teamfight. That's really a best-case scenario. 

Long justifications over. What I'd like to see is either a wind-up phase when the ult is called or a lower health pool for B.O.B. Or maybe some other change. As it is now, the risk vs. reward ratio for using Ashe's ult is way out of proportion. There's never a downside and a possibly teamfight-winning upside. ",Overwatch,1542346359.0,t3_9xjb04

Not Being Able to Endorse Friends is Too Strict,"I usually play overwatch with a group of friends, in a 4-6 stack. I now feel a tad punished for doing so, as in a 3 hour competetive OW session, I will only end up getting 5 or so endorsements, since the 1 or 2 rando's + enemy team are the only people that can endorse us. While it's not a big deal, it would still be nice for our freinds to be able to endorse each other.

I know that Blizzard restricted the ability to endorse friends due to fear of exploitation, but I believe that a full restriction is unnecessary, for 2 reasons:

1. You still have to actually finish a game with your friends to get endorsed. It doesn't matter if you have 200 friends on your friends list if you can only play with 5 at a time. Even if you rotated through 5 different friends each game, it would still take a long time to accrue endorsements
2. **Blizzard could impose stricter rules for endorsing freinds. For instance, maybe you can only receive 4 endorsements from friends per day, maxing out at 16 per week. This is still less than someone would accrue by solo queuing for a week (permitting you arent a toxic person), and inhibits ""endorsement farming"".**

I don't want to be left behind at level 2 endorsement for the next year just because i like to play with friends. I know that they are imaginary points that don't actually do much, but eventually people could be looked down upon for having a low endorsement level.

**TLDR: Blizzard could impose a daily and weekly limit on amount of friend endorsements received so those of us who enjoy playing with friends will no longer be punished for doing so.**",Overwatch,1530757370.0,t3_8w6zb4
Overwatch 2 is losing what made the first game special,"The values that made Overwatch, Overwatch were teamplay, team comps and the need to adapt to your peers and work together to achieve victory, and OW2 is removing that in favor of a more chaotic, deathmatchy environment like every other shooter in the market.

Except… **it really fucking isn’t.**

This is just an extreme overreaction from the fact that they are leaning towards more individual impact, removing tank synergies and the fact that people didn’t learn the game yet, making it feel more chaotic than it is, much like launch OW.

They are leaning towards more individual impact, yes, but that benefits everyone. Character synergies are still there, people working together still beats mechanical skill! What REALLY changed is that the outcome of the games rely less on a roll of the dice. In OW1, what ends up happening most of the time is that the game is so reliant on team work that getting teammates that don’t match well together is enough to lose a game before it even starts. Increasing individual impact doesn’t remove teamwork, it just makes so you don’t RELY on it as much, which is good for a solo queue experience. But that doesn’t subtract from people that stack, since the jolly cooperation is still there.

As for tank synergies, it is a shame, but at the same time they aren’t as engaging in OW1 as it seems. Most of the times it amounts to Zarya bubbling or D.Va matrixing feeding teammates, double fucking shield or Hog and Ball torture. There’s the focus fire, but tbh any character can do that.

Why the Genji Nerf in PTR is too harsh argument.,"Genji

-Double jump no longer resets when wall climbing

-Dash
No longer deals damage to traps like Widowmaker's Venom mine or Junkrat's Steel Trap
No longer bypasses Junkrat's Steel Trap

-Swift Strike
No longer interrupts quick melee attacks

-Dragonblade
Duration of Genji's ultimate has been reduced from 8 seconds to 6 seconds

&nbsp;

These are the changes to Genji in the new patch notes for PTR (https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/20243886). 

&nbsp;

Let me start by stating that I am not a ""Genji main"" what so ever. In fact Im kinda bad at the hero and I'd rather pick Tracer or Reaper, however I do not think Genji should be nerfed into the ground.

&nbsp;

First off the Dash changes are completely fine. Genji should not be able to bypass steel traps and should very well get trapped if he passes over one. 


&nbsp;

The swift strike no longer interrupting melee attacks, I completely understand why it was changed. For those who dont know Genji had a combo (Shoot + melee + dash). This combo did over 150 damage and could one shot tracers. With this new change you cannot do it anymore and it lowers Genji's burst damage up close a bit, however, from a developer stand point I can completely understand why this is a problem or bug because a hero therefore then is able to do more damage than intended through the exploitation of a bug which was the animation cancel of the melee with the dash. Blizzard has said they do not want animation canceling in there game and they have removed it on a few heroes already as it makes a hero stronger than intended, creating balance issues. Blizzard made the right call on that one. It should have been expected and it was long over due. 

&nbsp;


Now here is where I have a problem with this new patch: ""Double jump no longer resets when wall climbing"". This was uncalled for and must be changed. The main reason everyone complained that Genji was OP is because of his ultimate being too strong and it made Genji extremely easy to solo carry in LOW level play because people didn't know how to counter (which is the main reason Blizzard should stop listening to people who whine about a hero being OP because they refuse to switch heroes or learn how to deal with certain things and why Blizzard should just balance the game based on high level play), in high level play Genjis were not a problem what so ever and had to play extremely passive and just try to charge their ultimates as going straight at the enemy would mean certain death. In this current meta every team has a Zenyatta and a McCree and if a Genji went in at them he would quickly get discorded and 2 shotted by the McCree. 


&nbsp;

I will, however agree that his ultimate did need some tweaking as it lasted longer than support ultimates. Good Genjis would pop their ultimate and the enemy team, if they were smart, will pop a Zen ult or Lucio ult to counter, but the Genji could just wait it out and would have about 2 secs left on his ultimate, which is how much they reduced it by, and could potentially kill 1 or 2 people before his ultimate ran out if he was lucky. 

&nbsp;


So once again I agree with the Dash changes, the ultimate changes, and I saw the animation cancel changes coming, but now you not only nerfed Genji's damage, but you have also taken out the main skill cap of the hero, his mobility. Right now hes just a slighly better Hanzo when it comes to his movement. It actually makes Genji clunky to play now. The ""triple jump"" which was in the game before this patch was a fundamental part of Genji's play style. While I absolutely hate aiming at Genjis that would constantly jump around, it was definitely a great part of his kit and what allowed him to go in and out of combat and be that ""cyborg ninja"" that he was meant to be. 

&nbsp;

Bringing back the example of high level Genji play, it was already discouraging for him to attack the enemy as they had to play passively, but by taking out the ""triple jump"" and nerfing his mobility, they are even more discouraged to do what the character was designed to do, which was to harass the enemy. Even if the ""triple jump"" wasn't supposed to be in the game it was something that turned out to be a good thing as it made his movement smooth and more fluid, but now with this change it just feels clunky. This change which no one called for has now made it extremely harder for Genji to do his job effectively and reduces his skill cap. Fundamentally, this change made no sense and should be reverted back. I know that this only in the PTR though and that not everything is final, but if this change stays, Genji will go to being almost useless. Blizzard wants to one day make it so that every hero is balanced to the point that every hero is viable so I ask you Blizzard to please revert the ""Double jump no longer resets when wall climbing"" change or Genji will most likely die.

Nerf all the characters I don't know how to beat,"I was in a game today, as Hanzo of course, and while trying to hit a Widowmaker who was sniping my team from across the map, I realized something. This game has objectively terrible balance. I mean, how is it fair that Widowmaker can just press a button and suddenly zoom in on the map, while I have to carefully aim my shots from a distance. What's more, it's almost like my weapon doesn't even shoot in a straight line. It really feels like Widowmaker's gun just hits whatever the reticle happens to be on top of when she clicks to fire.

She isn't even the worst culprit either. I noticed during a king of the hill game that characters like Mei, Reaper, and even Junkrat are way too powerful when the opponent has to stay within limited, predictable area. Every time I stood on the point, I'd get killed by someone with a short range gun, even though I was pressing A to go left, which should have made it impossible for them to hit me. I mean, if they aren't on my screen, how can I be on theirs?

Then you have characters like Mercy, who's ult is just broken beyond belief. You're telling me that after I kill a Bastion who's been camping on a spot and taking out my team from a distance, she's just allowed to bring him back? If you ask me, she should only be able to bring back characters that aren't so hard to kill a second time. It's not fair to the team having a hard time, after minutes upon minutes of throwing themselves at the enemy line one after another only to finally eliminate a dug in enemy, to just be back where they started. 

And that brings me to my biggest complaint. Tracer. Now, I tested Tracer in the shooting range for a while. Her guns don't do much damage, she has to reload often, and she has little health. Naturally you'd think this is a weak character, right? Wrong. She's completely overpowered. Not only does her dash ability let her escape most short range characters, which I prefer, her rewind makes it so the damage you manage to squeeze in means nothing. I can't count the number of times I've hit her with a couple of shots as Reaper, only to watch her rewind and go another direction, avoiding my reach altogether. It feels like every time I engage with a Tracer, she just runs around, empties her clip at me, then dashes out of sight before I can counterattack. It's way too hard to catch her, making her low health a complete non issue.

"Moira, Gender and Transhumanism in Overwatch","Most of the transhumanism aesthetic I've seen in overwatch has come from places of necessity: many characters have lost limbs and gotten bionic replacements. Until we saw Moira's sprays, I thought Reaper's Wraith form seemed like a life-saving procedure. Similarly, man-made evolutionary leaps have been engineered, but in primates, not humans.

By contrast, it looks Moira does her mad science on humans just because she wants to (and maybe her subjects are willing, too). The only thing close to a motivation I can think of for the character's interest in her experiments is that she may be something a little more complicated than female. I'm not the right person to speculate, but the Bowie nods, androgynous hair and clothes, the spray in which she's depicted flat-chested while augmenting her right arm, all suggest she might have a more complicated perception of her own gender than most. It would be a good fit for someone like that to get into sci-fi body modification.

But setting aside her beliefs about gender, it's really interesting to see a world where, by and large, humanity has evolved machines into a sentient people but has only scratched the surface of playing with its own biology. Moira being able to create a wraith makes me wonder how the definition of humanity might change in a world with Omnics. I wonder what Zenyatta thinks about the upgrades that made Orisa, and if there's an omnic parallel for transhumanism. It seems like Moira's work faced a lot of ethical roadblocks from the world, but I would like to hear more about what the objections were. 

Cultures of fear regarding this subject have been the backdrop for a lot of great fiction, and I really want to know more about how Overwatch's world handles it.

CC Removal feels like making the game simply easier. CC was annoying ofc, but most of the time you could play around it's cooldowns and the space it creates.

Looks in general feel like a downgrade. Gold weapons aren't even golden anymore, new base skins (although the are not in the beta) are just fluffy, round and less detailed versions of the old ones. UI is terrible, it looks like a game from 10 years ago, that wanted to be modern. The scoreboard is a cool idea, but it feels not good to lose your complete vision when you press tab.

Really? No epic skins?,"You're telling me that if I were to try and earn all of the event skins with credits, I'd need 30k? That's just for the skins alone! Not even including dancing emotes

Man, I really thought Blizzard would reward us for all of our money spent on previous events by making it a bit easier to get these skins considering it's a ""celebration of our dedication this past year"", but NOPE! It's more of a money grab than ever before. If anything, they should at least pick this ONE EVENT to make the skins a permanent fixture and allow us to have a chance to get them well beyond the end of the event. 

People are defending Blizzard way too much. We should be able to criticize these bad business practices. Any other game or company would be getting torn apart for this type of micro-transaction model. 

Unless they severely tweak the RNG and give us much better probability, this is the biggest slap in the face to dedicated OW fans I could ever fathom. 

There isn't even really a cool new mode aside from that arcade deal. Truly disappointed. Way too much hype for just another money grabbing event. I don't think I can bring myself to buy loot boxes and throw away my morals for a couple cool looking skins.

I hate how this game’s playerbase treats DPS mains.,"Don’t know where else to put this. I know nobody even cares and this’ll sound like a copypasta but here it goes : 

I unironically fucking hate how the community treats DPS mains. It’s treated as a role that has no utility and only fucking played by monkeys or throwers, That last part is kinda true but it’s annoying. 

 I’m a lowley Silver because I suck balls at almost every hero and never stick to one. I’m bad at literally everybody except Hanzo. I play Hanzo at like a low plat/high gold, At least I’ve had people around that elo and above tell me so. 

So three games ago I had the fucking gall to play Genji when we had a 2-2-2 and only get silver damage and elims, I’m not a world class Genji so naturally I should be mocked and torn apart and I was. 

So the 4 man group on my team shat on me relentlessly. I was called racial slurs because of my accent and generally just shit on all match. I always defended myself and reminded them I’d wipe my ass with their heads if they wanted to 1v1, They unpolitely declined and I queued up again. 

To my surprise they were now on the enemy
team. I switched to my best hero in Hanzo and did my best. Every time I killed one of them I’d type a number, and that number was the amount of times I killed them, I also talked a lot of shit every time I could. I must’ve gotten at least 35 kills and the overwhelming majority of them on those 4 douchebags, More importantly we etched out a narrow 2-1 victory. and GODDD THAT FELT GOOD. That was like 50+ games of resentment towards that type of toxicity just absolutely being let out. 

But that toxicity shouldn’t even exist in the first place. Nobody in similarly competitive games like League of Legends and R6 Siege holds the same amount of vitriol to damage roles.",Overwatch,1565418200.0,t3_coeizf

Currently, this sub is an example why ""capital G""  *Gamers* are many parts dumb and can never be satisfied. The reality is that the lot of you **won't** be voting with your wallets or time, and will still be paying your money, in spite of all of Blizzards clear failures. And that's exactly what Bliz is counting on; there will always be enough people, even the loudest of gamers, who'll still gladly pay to play enough to uphold the bottom line. 

I'm not happy with how this looks either, but I'm also not pressed about it as Blizzard has been doing a shit job of communication(hence all y'all's hoopla of the past day or so). So, a some screenshots and tweets from semi random employees etc are neat, but 1)aren't the final product and/or 2)are not an official post/announcement/ PR release.

"This game is being ruined by the ""It's just Quickplay"" mentality","EDIT: Honestly, how hard is it to understand that playing with throwers is not fun

I just wanna play the game with a decent team comp. The quadruple DPS plus Sym is not fun to play with. I understand it's ""just quickplay"" but some people want to actually practice new heroes, and it becomes impossible with an uncoordinated team. I know there's nothing Blizzard can do to alleviate this issue, but seriously, this mentality has to go. Save it for a custom game or something.

"76 Is way too strong now, and is basically better than McCree now because Blizzard keeps treating them the same.","These heroes are different, so why is blizzard treating them the same? **Before McCree was just better, but rather than create a distinction between how these heroes handle combat, they treat them the same.** Their combat pattern is the same, 76 no longer even NEEDS his rockets to kill you. 

They just buff Soldiers76's primary means of damage with his Pulserifle's bullets. But the primary distinction between 76 and McCree is that 76 is supposed to finish you off with his Rockets, McCree is supposed to flat out kill you with his primary fire. 

76 whittles you down and then fires a rocket at you to finish the job when you're low enough, or starts off with a rocket if he knows he has a good chance at hitting you for 120 damage. 

You can't have 76 have High Sustained DPS in addition to his rocket, that makes him too good. So Revert the buff to 76's Primary Fire, and instead buff his rocket in some way that makes it better for finishing people off. Maybe even a cooldown adjustment or something, I have no idea.

The primrary distinction in the way McCree and 76 Handles combat is most assuredly the rocket.  76 Feels like a suped up McCree.

"Blizzard, this is why people are butthurt for not getting the Beta","**Edit: I happened to post this right after the beta flagging was done for the beta weekend. Bad timing. Read this as one mans picture of the whole beta process and what they wanted out of it.**


I've seen Blizzard saying they don't understand why people are salty, frustrated, whiny and posting lots of sad memes etc.

Blizzard, a lot of us have played your games for 10 years, quite a few probably even 15 years +. People my age, almost 30 (FeelsOldMan) grew up in games like cs. Shooters is my bread and butter. I'm a variety gamer as I think most people are nowadays but fps is generally what we enjoy the most. There hasn't been a good fps out in ages. I don't like to play csgo anymore. I want new AWESOME games!
Games like The Division, Rainbow Six Siege, H1Z1 tries really hard but fails fundamentally. They've focused on the wrong things. H1Z1 has potential but we'll see where they end up.

But then there's Blizzard, you guys understand gaming and know what makes a game fun and enjoyable (except wow lately Kappa). So we're finally REALLY excited for your completely new franchise, we've spent a huge amount of time and money in your games all throughout the years. We simply love them!

The beta gets out, don't get the first wave, not the second or the third. There's a huge hype train around Overwatch, EVERYONE wants to play it just because their friends talked so highly about it. A lot of them probably bought one blizzard game or spent a few hours in either HOTS or Heartstone. Somehow they start to get into the beta. More and more of them get access, there's a beta weekend. Still no invite.... More people get weekend invites but no. Still sidelined to watch streams but I just can't take that anymore. It honestly hurts to watch it. It's a beta and lots of people can't even contribute. There's beta tournaments, whole teams are invited to play them. You start to think, is this beta really about development? Probably not as much as people think. Just the fine tuning of stats to make sure the matches are even. I think it'll be a big difference during the open beta when you let everyone in. You keep saying you had millions of people signing up for the beta. I have multiple friends saying they never checked the Overwatch box, are not interested but are yet still in the beta. **You can't have an automatic opt in and claim people are signed up for a beta...**
Let people check a few boxes in a form and see what type of gamers they are and actually optimize the beta testing!
You guys are so well aware of gaming, development and then you do a beta this messy. It's so confusing what you actually want to get out of it.

People react differently, some are really angry, some shrugs it off and say they're not interested, some cancel the pre-orders and some just post sad memes on reddit, twitter and the forums. 

The open beta is around the corner and of course you guys time that with them changing pipes in my apartment... Just my luck.

I doubt I'm the only one having this picture. I'm really curious about some stats. How many people are invited to the beta and haven't played it? How many people are invited and have played less than 10 hours?

This is my take on it both with friends IRL and over the internet.

Hope this clears some things up for you Blizzard.

Overwatch needs an ACTUAL tutorial,"It’s no secret there’s a lot of toxicity and salt in our community lately. I believe these are some of the major issues:

-	Instalocked DPS with no thought to team comp
-	Feeling forced to play healers and tanks
-	Throwing or quitting if things go to shit
-	People not joining comms
-	Salty behavior and bullying
-	Being a dick about off-meta picks
-	Not switching heroes when needed
-	Not knowing basics like ult synergy

There’s more, but you get the gist.

So how do begin to tackle such a variety of different problems?

I believe there’s one thing that could help: FIX THE GAME’S TUTORIAL.

Remember the tutorial? The one with 76 that teaches you how to move about and how to push triangle on your controller to ult? The one that *doesn’t actually teach you anything about playing the fucking game?*

Yes, that tutorial. It sucks, and it sets up many of the aforementioned problems before you’ve even played your first match. Let’s see why:

-	Instalocked DPS with no thought to team comp: *People pick heroes with big guns because they don’t understand that a successful team needs a mixture of hero types to be effective. If you don’t understand why your team needs a healer, why would you play one when you can blow shit up?*
-	Throwing or quitting if things go to shit: *Well obviously people are going to rage quit if they’re losing and have no idea why. “Gold elims and damage but I’m still getting steamrolled? Fuck this!” If only they knew that switching heroes to counter the enemy would solve their woes.*
-	People not joining comms: *If you don’t understand that Overwatch is a team game, why would you bother joining the voice channel to listen to whiny 8-year-olds or some salty Genji main? And since there’s no such thing as combining ults or hero synergy, comms feels totally unnecessary.*
-	Salty behavior and bullying: *Not one single player of this game hasn’t been asked to switch a hero at one point or another, usually accompanied by salt. Why? Because there are people who understand how the game is played and there are people who do not, and therein lies the conflict.*

Now, I believe the tutorial is as shitty as it is for a reason, and as much as I love you, Blizz, you’ve done it on purpose. By leaving it as open-ended and vague as possible, the game appeals to way more people, and it comes across as so simple that anyone can pick up Overwatch and jump right in.

While that’s one of the things I love about the game (that casual players or newbies to shooters can still find it accessible, plus it encourages more female gamers to join the community), it does fuck all to teach people how to play properly. Sure there’s one or two loading hints that mention teaming up to be more successful, but that’s it.

So here’s what I propose. I understand Blizz is busy toiling away on our favourite game, and they’re battling enough as it is to keep the fresh content coming as fast as players demand it. I also know they’re not likely to do this themselves as it goes against their idea of making the game accessible. Thus, I suggest we, the r/Overwatch community (with some assistance from r/OverwatchUniversity and r/OWConsole), make our own informative, useful tutorial, and pitch it to Blizzard to include in the game.

Thoughts?

EDIT: Please understand that when I say these are problems, it doesn't mean I agree with them. For example, when I say people complain about off meta picks, it doesn't mean I agree with that behaviour. Personally I don't give two fucks about the meta, but the reality is that meta complaining happens, and thus needs to be addressed.",Overwatch,1505140335.0,t3_6zfqxg
"AMA! Hey open beta players! I'm a top-tier competitive Overwatch player, here to answer any questions regarding gameplay, strategy or hero compositions!","Hey everyone,

Since the influx of players after the open beta doors opened, I figured I'd try to help and address some potential issues players were facing in-game. Are you having a hard time vs. a specific hero? Are you unsure what hero is best for the team in certain situations? Ask away and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability!

Some more info about me: I play mainly the tank role in Rogue, that includes heroes such as Reinhardt, Winston and Roadhog, but in some compositions I flex to whatever hero is needed the most. 

When it comes to strategy within our team we all give suggestions about we can do to improve our play, it's not like we have an in-game leader like most other games, although the Lucio player is normally the one shot-calling what to do.

Is it just me or is a lot of OW2 criticism rooted in a lack of experience/knowledge?,"I've seen a lot of good and fair opinions about OW2, as there's a lot of fair things to criticize it on. But I also see a lot of bad opinions, of course that includes thinking that it's a 60 dollar update. But that's fairly obvious, what I mean is more so criticism of role queue remaining in the game, and gameplay for instance.

Examples:  


People taking issue with a lack of support reworks: From all I've seen, it's my personal belief that supports have very stable and functional kits that don't necessarily need a full overhaul to be enjoyable or playable, even if they would be cool and interesting to see.  


Brig losing stun: As someone who mains Brig primarily, it seems crazy to me that people would see this as an issue. As for losing her stun, she instead got a much longer range bash, bash deals decent damage, goes through shields, triggers inspire, and has a lower cooldown. And to me as a Brig main, having a better capacity to fight and chase people down, means a lot more than briefly stopping someone in their tracks, especially when I can just kill someone on the enemy team instead of be a stun bot.  


5v5 in general: I've seen people take issue with 5v5, or simply address it as a change neither positive or negative, when as a whole, it's a tide that raises all ships. Tanks are no longer bullet sponges with very little impact damage wise, and supports are no longer completely at the whim of those they heal(assuming they have a kit that lets them fight).  


And a last example, role queue still existing: In short, it's bad casually, but it's amazing for ranked. Between options such as autofill, queueing for all, and open queue, if you want a really good ranked experience. The best thing is for people to be able to restrict their roles to those they actually want to play, and those they know how to play.  


Within those 4 examples, my common line of thinking is that these complaints are caused by a lack of experience, playing at less serious levels etc. As a good few of the complaints with OW2 I hear, aren't even remotely reflected in my experience with ranked, and generally ranks above gold.  


And none of that would really be anyone's fault, as there's no shame in the level people play at. But it looks a lot like complaints you'd only have when you don't really have experience with certain heroes, certain playstyles, and or generally not having experience with proper teamplay, or the challenges of certains roles such as tank or support.  


Essentially, I kinda just wanna hear some people's thoughts about whether I'm wrong, interpreting things wrong, whether or not people's opinions are completely valid, and generally people's opinions of what causes people to feel the way they do about OW2.",Overwatch,1652702108.0,t3_uqu72i

It's okay to blame the Overwatch devs.,"Obvious Disclaimer but if you think my arguments is an excuse to harass and act out violence towards people, you're a fucking idiot. 

&#x200B;

Why is it that whenever a controversy or scandal emerges from Blizzard, people parrot the saying ""It's not the developers fault, it's the management, the higher ups, the developers are great people, passionate, etc etc."" I feel like that sentiment is parroted by influencers that don't want to get into a negative relationship with developers, due to them losing access to certain privileges such as events (LIKE THE 2019 OVERWATCH PVE DEMO) and information. Honestly, when has placing the blame solely on Blizzard execs ever do anything? When WoW expansions were bad, no one blamed the devs. When Warcraft 3 Reforged flopped, no one blamed the devs. When Diablo 3's auction house happened, and removal of trading happened, no one blamed the devs. It all gets blamed on some nebulous terms such as ""Higher ups, management, or shareholders"" while none of the responsibility gets shouldered on the devs, no matter how much they must've took part in said controversy.

Sir Swag's recent video honestly made me think if this was deliberate. His sole anonymous source, was, in his own words an individual with multiple ties to Blizzard developers. Someone like that MUST be in a very friendly relationship with said developers, for them to be privy of information that could land them in violation of NDA agreements. It is more than reasonable to assume said ""anonymous source"" is running defense for the Overwatch devs. Also, keep in mind, this person or atleast, the developers he/she has ties to MUST have known in advance that Overwatch's PvE was to be scrapped, but only waited until AFTER the recent announcement to disclose this information to Sir Swag. It's also reasonable to assume the developers themselves didn't think this controversy would have been a big deal, and they could ride it out.

If these Oh so ""passionate"" game developers cared about their work so much, why didn't they organize a walkout? Walkouts have happened before over other controversies. They did form a union last year in December, and could've taken action against something as egregious as this, but didn't. They sat on their hands for months after Overwatch 2 entered Early Access. 

While I also blame the executives for allowing the PVE mode to be shelved due to fiscal decisions, I'm convinced Blizzard is essentially running on new blood, and they're not willing to put in the same patience and work into a game the old guard did.",Overwatch,1684529826.0,t3_13m7j5t
Remove One Shots (Widowmaker),"I don't think widowmaker should one be able to one shot squishies.

I think it's extremely unbalanced in a game where the ttk is as long as it is.  Almost every heros ttk is extremely long when compared to most fps and other heros in the game.  Yes widow takes a lot of skill to be good at.  But it is not fun for anyone when a really good widow dominates a game.  It's not fun for the widows tank, support, or other dps as you're usually just sitting back while she does all the work.  It's even worse to play against because there isn't much you can do.

If your widow is worse then that option is out, on long sightline maps where widow is played, you can't really have your tank dive her because then you have no tank to peel for your supports and then you die.  The only options are go full dive and or play out of her sightline.  Nothing is more boing to me then having to hug a wall and pray that I don't peak out too much so the widow doesn't kill me before I can even react.

I think OW at it's best is a team game.  Widowmaker is the only hero in the roster where you don't really play with her as a team.  She's able to sit miles back from any team fight and be the most valuable player.  I don't think that should make sense in a team oriented game.

Some possible fixes are:

Add damage drop off like every other hitscan in the game

Nerf her health to 150 so characters like ana can 2 shot her.

Add recoil/knockback when getting shot at when scoped.

Increase the time between each shot.  She isn't punished when she misses a shot as of now.

Moira GOLDEN BACKPACK still isn't a thing?,"I mean, first they made Brigitte's shield gold (which wasn't in the first place). Second, shortly after release, they made Ashe's ult BOB (the whole robot, mind you) gold as well.

You know the similarity between the two cases mentioned above? 

That's right, players begged for those to happen. That's why I was wondering, the same sentiments was brought up for Moira for a long time, but still Blizzard still hasn't acknowledge it.

I get it, it's not visible to the player's HUD. But technically it's still part of her weapon-----scratch that, it is her very weapon, she just uses her hands to control it. The worst part here is that other players can't even notice her golden weapon because her entire sleeves are covering the entire damn thing. The backpack is where her abilities came from, so it doesn't make any sense why they didn't even considered making it gold in the first place. I mean for Christ sake they're capable of making an entire robot gold, but can't do it on a backpack. Come on.

Edit: personally I think she just needs a small amount of tuning still. In my opinion her ultimate lasts a bit too long. You can definitely beat a team with a mercy, when your team doesn’t have one, but it’s more of a challenge with her current kit than it should be.

First off, the obvious. 

Rule 1: Bastion has the highest Dps in the game deployed. At the same time he is completely immobile. Fight him at long range. Take soldier, widow, pharah, hanzo. I've seen Junkrat suggested, and it's not a bad idea, but often I find bastion entrenched in a location that I can't lob at from cover. If junk rats an option, by all means use him. Also note: don't fly up in the air as pharah here, for what should be obvious reasons, but I see this too often. If a bastion can be sneaked up on, tracer bombs and roadhog hooks are also an option. 

""But aznman375, bastion is so accurate, even at long range. It's bullshit, I can't do it""

He's completely immobile. **You aren't.** Fight from behind a corner. Use terrain as cover so his cone barely hits you. I see a lot of bad players take these counter picks, but stupidly stand right in the open trying to challenge bastion instead of popping in and out of cover for burst. Why gimp yourself?

Too often I see a team killed by a surprise bastion around the corner, then GO OUT IN THE OPEN AGAIN TO TRY AND OUT DAMAGE HIM. What are you expecting to change? If I get pushed off a ledge by lucio or pharah I'm not going to run to that same cliff to fight them again. 

Rule 2: don't fight him as a tank. Bastion shreds tanks. I don't try and fight reaper when I'm Reinhardt. I don't pick fights with mccree when I'm reaper. Why try to fight against your counter? 

It's stupid to try and challenge him in an upfront battle. The only thing tanks should do against a bastion is act as a bridge between cover (Dva defense matrix, Reinhardt shield) and the GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY. Your job is done. Don't feed ult charge. Protect the team from flankers if you can. Just stay out of line of sight, and once your long range has poked bastion away you can resume taking the objective. 

""Aznman375, he's protected by a Reinhardt and boosted by a mercy, now what?""

They've finally done it. 3 people are working together as a team. Guess what? That means you've gotta work together too. This team play can look intimidating, but the main piece of this combo is still bastion, and he's still immobile as fuck (or at worst, moving at payload speed, which is practically immobile). My favorite options to tackle this are multiple symmetras or reinhardts. Both these characters have huge, long range, shield piercing projectiles that do shit tons of damage (125 for a sym ball, 100 for a fire strike). The goal is to one shot the bastion in one go, or kill the mercy as collateral (again, huge projectiles)

Flanking is also an option here, but this requires a lot of coordination, since both sides of the flank will require good cover from bastion to make it work, and if a mercy is there she can prolong the fight to an unfavorable amount of time. 

Rule 3: check your corners. Some bastions set up to surprise impatient teams. Don't run past an intersection without looking down potential firing lines. 

The only thing unfun about bastion is how easy he is to kill. He's barely seen in higher levels of play, and this is for a reason. Play smarter, play better, and bastion won't be a problem. 

This post may come across as mean, but honestly the comments and ""new"" of this subreddit are filled with salt from new players about bastion and it's kind of tiring. ",Overwatch,1462646405.0,t3_4ib5s1
How I troll with sprays,"I wonder if I am alone in doing this, but I like to use [this spray](http://i.imgur.com/gaRosfX.jpg), put it somewhere out of sight, like on the ceiling in the starting room during pre-match, and then on TeamSpeak, tell my friends I found a cool glitch, easter egg or something visual, and get them to look up, and then scream YOU GOT PROBED and leap around them while hooting over the microphone.

We collapse into fits of idiotic giggles every time I get someone to look at it without realising. Tell me i'm not the only crazy bastard having too much fun with this spray?

I like to make them follow elaborate methods too, which eventually lead them around the corner to the spray. It's impressive how they still don't see it coming :D",Overwatch,1457450059.0,t3_49iwgn
❄️MEI is not a Hitscan. So why does she have Damage Falloff?,"First thing to point out, Mei has an absolutely abysmal pickrate in Competitive. 
http://i.imgur.com/so1fdQ3.png
_

Next, 
Mei has the only projectile in the game that has falloff damage. 
Here's a quick example of what I'm talking about.
http://i.imgur.com/EJzGks7.png

At 50m range, Mei's Icicle is doing a piddling 22 damage.

Every. Other. Projectile. in the game, does full damage at it's max range.

So why is Mei uniquely crippled like this?

Mei is great at 1v1 freeze kills, at low ranks.
But at higher skill tiers, they just avoid the Freeze, and it gets Zarya bubbled if they don't, and Mei can't deal with more than 1 hero at a time this way. (So she can't deal with coordinated play).
But if you buff her freeze enough for high tier play, it will cause Bronze/Silver players to go supernova with rage.

The ONLY way to buff Mei that makes sense is to bring her projectile back in line with all other projectiles and make it have No Damage Falloff.

Like Every Other Projectile In The Game.

Then Mei can deal with high mobility heroes like Tracer/Genji, and ranged heroes like Soldier/McCree/Pharah. The main viable damage heroes in Competitive.

IMO: Beta Has To Start Before Oct 27th or Much Later After SC2 LotV,"We have the following big games coming out soon:

* Halo 5: Oct. 27th
* Black Ops 3: Nov. 6th
* Starcraft 2 LotV: Nov. 10th

A beta is not only meant to test/improve a game, but to also start drawing a lot of people to the game and create a community. With the big titles shown above coming out soon, the beta needs to begin before Halo 5 on Oct. 27th.

For one thing, Halo 5 and Black Ops 3 are shooters. The other is that Starcraft 2 belongs to Blizzard, so they would not bring out 2 of their products around the same time. So based on that logic, Overwatch would not come out until at least 2-3 weeks after Starcraft 2. They would want as much hype and sales for SC2. Why ruin that by bringing out Overwatch beta close to its release date?

On top of that, Blizzard has invited streamers to an event on Oct. 15 to come to their headquarters, play the game, and do their media stuff. Usually in these events, the streamers are given information with an NDA. The streamers then announce that something big is going to happen. Once the NDA lifts, they announce the information. Again, this helps generate a lot of hype.

So with all that, the beta should start just before all these big games come out. I would say Oct. 19-23. Either that or it comes out much later after Starcraft 2's launch.",Overwatch,1443477620.0,t3_3mr7nt

Top reasons Overwatch will succeed,,Overwatch,1440886816.0,t3_3iw5is
The matchmaking knows when to make you lose and win. Which makes this game unfair and frustrating,"Blizzard decides when you win or lose, so this game is kind of a scam, where you can never get better because it doesn’t care about your individual skill. 

When you win you feel like you got carried, and when you lose you get snowballed. Often with noticeably bad teammates. 

The matchmaker feeds on human emotions, making you lose enough that you get annoyed but gives you enough wins to make you keep coming back.

It’s the same strategy used by gambling machines. Most people play out of addiction. The hidden MMR system puts a number on every teams skill and intentionally puts them against weaker opponents to give them a win, the team losing will get a free win eventually so they realize the value of a win and keep playing hoping for more wins, blissfully unaware that they really have no power over the outcome. 

Even if you play exceptionally well you will lose/win only when the matchmaker deems it so. 


I will say the top500 players are playing a completely different game from the regular players. Just like you hear about lottery wins on tv to keep people wasting money on tickets. You think this game is fair and balanced but really you don’t have any real control on the outcome whatsoever. The matchmaker aka blizzard decided everything. 

So ultimately this is not a real game it’s just designed to keep you gambling your life away for nothing in return. You won’t improve or grow even after 3000 hours you’ll still lose constantly because well there needs to be more loses than wins for blizzards system to work. It’s a scam designed to take your life away.",Overwatch,1694436819.0,t3_16fuj01

How to identify a very frustrated and unskilled person in the actual OW2,,Overwatch,1668604590.0,t3_ywt1q6
"The more news I hear about OW2, the more skeptical I am, and the more Ill miss OW1","I know this will probably be downvoted and Ill just look like a hater, but I want to hear your guys opinion on this so I will go on a small, not so cohesive rant / brainstorm, so please hear me out... I will try to divide each point into its own little paragraph. (TLDR at the end)  


Right now, OW2 feels like a huge hit or miss risk for a lot of OW1 players and the absolute poor marketing / communication doesnt help... It kinda feels to me that blizzard knew that there will be massive community backlash for some things like for example heroes on the battle pass and skin pricing, so they announced them as late as possible.

More than half of the players Ive asked in the last week about their feelings on OW2 responded that theyre excited about it, that it looks promising, and that they are really interested in the PvE campaign. 

ALL of them were shocked when I told them that PvE is not gonna be there on release, and that it is in fact, coming in 2023 (Is it for sure though? I am confused because I have that information from some guy on reddit, not from blizzard as far as I know). 

Yes yes I know that its an ongoing thing that the OW2 marketing campaign is probably the biggest flop in gaming history.

Dont get me wrong, I am really excited about the game too, I want to see it thrive just like in the old days, I want the game to be this amazing fun thing that lasts, but I am just more and more skeptical / worried about it the more news I hear. Do you guys feel the same or am I the only one?

Free Kiriko for OW1 players is nice enough, but it feels like a device to reduce the backlash from the original community atleast for launch. My question is, how is season 6 going to feel?

Reusing a lot of assets from OW1 for the launch of OW2 doesnt really help the weird worrying feeling that I have, because we, as OW1 players, have waited for years without non-cosmetic content for this so I think a lot of players set their expectations a bit higher. I am (perhaps naively) optimistic that this will change in later seasons as the game makes more revenue on its own.

As far as gameplay goes, I dont really mind the game going 5v5 or the SMS protection, its there now, h opefully it makes the game more playable (in the case of SMS protect) and fun / different (in the case of 5v5) the only real issue I have with gameplay is the battle pass heroes.. Those just rub me in the wrong way...

The skin pricing is whatever... Some of these skins are really expensive and dont look like theyre worth the money (Im looking at you, legendary Junker Queen). I also have no clue why the OWL skins are suddenly more expensive when they use the same old models from OW1 (another case of reused assets). It would feel a lot more acceptable if they used the new OW2 models for them but whatever, I wasnt a huge fan of OWL skins anyway... It just feels kinda weird and rip off-ey...

I cant help but feel that theyre trying to put in the least amount of work that they can get away with. Other than that i really have no clue about the OWL skin price changes even though theyre the old skins we had for years now.

It will feel really bad for OW1 players to go from ""here, you can get every single cosmetic for your main, and as long as you play / grind you can pretty much buy any skin you want without using any money"" to being dripfed small cosmetic items every now and then and getting a few coins from challenges to spend on a skin or the battle pass every now and then as a F2P player.

 Look, I know why they have changed the monetisation system to this, 40$ for a game that does not ""force"" you to spend any money on it at all is just not profitable in 2022 anymore, and I really hope that we get to see some results for this change in game. New heroes, new game modes, new events (not recycled), PvE campaign, it can all be great, but I just cannot make myself as hyped for it as I want to be, because it all just feels a bit weird...

I´m sure that the game will play great for a casual player, just like OW1, but OW1 was SO generous to the players and I havent appreciated it at all until I started hearing more and more news about OW2.

I really want to see this game succeed and be the best game that it can be and not just this weird MTX filled, bastardised version of OW1... I am not saying that it will be a bastardised version of OW1, and I really hope Im right...

Thats about it. I needed to get this off my chest and see if anyone else feels the same. If you read it all, please, let me know how you feel about the points I made. Im sure I forgot something because I was basically vomiting all this text into my keyboard straight from my brain.

&#x200B;

TLDR : I really want to see OW2 become the true successor of OW1 and not a sidegrade / downgrade. I am worried about the future of the game I loved for so many years. I, as an OW1 player, am not a huge fan of the new monetisation model, but if it means more fun and exciting content, then I will accept it wholeheartedly.  I hope they scrap the heroes in the BP thing or atleast move the heroes into a more reasonable tier on the battle pass because 55 just feels like a spit in the face for players that dont buy the BP. The main thing that worries me is that the new content in OW2 (on launch) does not (atleast from what we know so far) feel like OW2, it feels like OW 1.2 but one can only hope that will change drastically in the future.

When you guys say ""damn smurf they are so bad for the game"", actually no, they aren't, you are just referring to stupid people grieffing your games, those are not legit smurfs.

Why I only play vs A.I and why blizzard should let them lvl and complete challenges like PvP,"Here's my reasoning why I only really play against vs A.I because one I'm very very bad at this game I'll be the first to admit this.
 I've  played sense day ones and I have improved but not by much a monkey could beat me in this game pretty easily.
   so I like A.I because it makes me feel better about myself and like I'm not a hindrance to my time. anytime I play quick play I'll die and basically lose no matter how hard I try my KD is like 0.8 and I lose 70-80% of my games so it makes me feel like I'm just bringing down my team and making it harder for them.
  I also have anger issues when it comes to Alot of pvp games, I know people would say to stop playing but that's the thing..I enjoy the game and I enjoy the characters. So it's hard for me to not play when I enjoy the game 
  So basically long story short I enjoy the game but I enjoy A.I more because on how I feel about PvP in both skill and team. And it kind of hurts how in overwatch 2 VS. A.I players can't earn like pvp players we really can't lvl up characters and we can't complete challenges to help our battle pass progression.
  Ik people are going to say ""it's a PvP game"" and yes I know it is but in overwatch 1 VS A.I players could still earn everything PVP players could yeah it was slightly slower but the point is they could (not counting competitive of course but that's a no da moment)
  All I want is just a the same chance to get the same rewards as PvP even if it takes longer if they have to make a second challenge list where you can complete in VS A.I and just make the challenges longer instead of playing 30 games for a weekly make it 60, heal 15,000 damage for daily make it 30,000.
  Basically just double the amount of it in Vs. A.I. mode and for character level just keep it the same or make it to where you need 2 eliminations count as 1 and make damage basically just half whatever they did in match.",Overwatch,1692881576.0,t3_16014v0
The Assassin from Retribution is such a cool concept for a playable hero. What are your thoughts on how her abilities could be?,"I'll start. She's an offence hero, obviously.

'Shift' ability could be like tracer's blink, except she can only blink to walls to latch on in a radius of 20 meters. 5 Blinks, with a cool down of 0.5 seconds between each blink so you can't spam consecutively. Cooldown for each blink is probably 3 seconds.

'E' could be lock on to an enemy, and pressing 'E' again while locked on could make her do the crazy drag run and do the flurry swipes melee attack. Flurry does like 60 damage per second and whoever you're fucking up can't use any abilities or move. Pressing 'E' or 'Space' will cancel the attack. Cooldown is 7 seconds.

She'll have 150 health but her passive would be regen 20 health per second, even while being attacked. But if she's doing her rush she only regens 15 per second.

Her primary fire is probably like Doomfists: Obligatory and a good finisher. Shoots projectile shivs that do 30 damage over the course of a second (Like ana's darts). Ammo clip is 4 and has a timer to recharge (Like Doomfist)

Honestly no idea on what the ultimate could be. Poison aura? Kinda like transcendence. You're invincible and and the area around you is basically Widow's poison gas. Enemies can run out of it but it'll still have the lingering effect that'll wear off. But if you stay in it, it works 1.5 times faster and the effect won't wear off. Also once the ult ends (maybe lasts 6 seconds), all your abilities are on cool down. So you can't blink or flurry rush.

I had fun making this, but it obviusly needs work. What are your ideas on how to make the Assassin work?

People who say Illari's ult is a dps ult are misunderstanding it imo,"I think Illari's ult is quite in line with what a support Ult does. The Ult doesn't actually do damage on its own but it applies a status that results in a lot of damage IF you and your team follow up on it. 

 Ultimately it's not super different than Bap's or Kiri's Ult. It increases the potential of damage/elims but on its own doesn't really do much.

 Mechanically it's quite different, especially cuz you even have the potential to kill enemies hiding in cover, sure, but in spirit I find it to be a support ult through and through. 

""Yes but Bap's window can be covered with a wall/shield"" yes and Illari ult can be eaten by Javelin/matrix or deflected by Genji back on your team or just suzu'ed away.

""Yes but it's quite OP"" so is Kiri's ult. In fact you could argue that Illari's ult has a cap on the damage it can di once it explodes even when it permeates but Kiri's ult scales up whatever damage per second you do by a percentage, same with damage boosting on a Mercy Ult or just regularly. I don't think her Ult is broken.

Let's be realistic, the only reason Doom and Hog got nerfed was largely because the top streamers and YouTubers were complaining about them so the devs had to appease them. Moreweth, a Top 500 streamer and Ball OTP, reacted to Flats and called out all the inaccuracies in Flats' video, which some of them felt like intentional lies just for the sake of content, but in Flats' case that's dangerous because he holds a large influence in the community, and I don't think it's fair that Ball gets the Doom treatment just because Flats complained about it.

Overwatch 2 is not Overwatch.,"You're playing Overwatch 2. A f2p game. You'll never get cool free legendary skins anymore and the event rewards will be minuscule. You'll either fork over $20 to Blizzard for that legendary skin and start becoming a whale, pay $10 for a crap battle pass for ""value"", or quit the game entirely because all of the content is locked behind a paywall. Those are pretty much your options. Blizzard will not make it easier for you to obtain anything because it is a company that needs to make money. Overwatch was truly a blessing and extremely rewarding for a one-time purchase but it doesn't exist anymore and it never will.

If you expect the PvE model to be any different, don't have high hopes. I expect it will have in-game purchases too. If you truly love Overwatch you would stop supporting where the direction of the game is headed. Jeff and Geoff are gone, and they've been gone for a while. Isn't that a big enough sign to make you realize that it's over? Overwatch 2 is a ghost of its former self. It lost all of its soul to corporate greed.

"A Response to ""The Girl Problem"" Post: Moral Grandstanding Doesn't Fix Anything","Where do I even begin with this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/8hvmih/the_girl_problem_an_open_letter_to_the_overwatch/)? I guess I'll start off by saying I agree with the message of the post. No one deserves to be harassed or ridiculed, regardless gender, race, sexual orientation, creed etc. But moral grandstanding isn't going to change the people who need to change the most. The discourse between rallying for positive change while personally attacking people just rubs me the wrong way, even if those people are toxic.

I'll put my own personal interjection here. Well I guess this entire post is a personal interjection but indulge me. I'm ethnically Korean, and back when we had loads of Koreans playing on NA to escape the rampant cheating in the Asia servers, I tried my best to translate between them and us so we had a better chance of winning. If it worked, people were fine. If it didn't, I'd be called chink, gook, ching-chong you fuckin name it. ""Tell your gook friends to stay in their servers"" etc. That's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of toxicity but you guys already know.

The experience is... Unpleasant to say the least. But I've always shrugged it off because why would I care about what some internet stranger said to me? Anonymous bigotry means that their bigotry is meaningless. It's noise.

**""But if you don't do anything, how will there be any change?""**

Well rhetorical-question-person, I'd agree with you. Except ""The Girl Problem"" (I'll be referring to this as The Post from now on cause I'm lazy) with it's ""Holier than thou"" attitude is the complete wrong way to go about actually getting the change we want. Especially since the OP of The Post outright personally attacks toxic people.

Let's look the psychology of most bullies. A peer-reviewed source called ""The Bullies: Understanding Bullies and Bullying"" by Dennis Lines (I would've hyperlinked it here but I got the source through my Uni library and I don't think you can access it unless you go here. Feel free to look it up for yourself though) claims that bullies have common characteristics:

**1. Wish to control others**

**2. Individuals having poor social skills and who are often unpopular**

**3. Lack a strong sense of individual self and will feel threatened when being questioned or challenged**

**4. It is as though they need to have and to exercise control and power over those they regard as being subservient to them**

^^^I'm ^^^not ^^^trying ^^^to ^^^talk ^^^shit, ^^^this ^^^is ^^^literally ^^^word ^^^for ^^^word ^^^from ^^^the ^^^source.

The Post just feeds into points 1 and 4. By getting a reaction out of people they are asserting a form of perverse control over us. My post is doing the exact same thing. When we react by posting about them, we are only reinforcing their shit behaviour. Instead, we should focus on points 2 and 3. 

**What can we do as a community to help these people reform?**

- Preaching for positive change while calling toxic people ""Sweaty manchildren"" certainly doesn't help. Name-calling goes both ways.

- > ""Also, every person who responded to this post with ""shut up Mercy bitch"" just proved my point. I know you think you're hilarious but you're not gonna get a comedy special for your scathing wit."" 

 Being condescending towards toxic people just further drives a wedge between them and the positive change we want. Nobody likes being talked down to.

From the same source, there's a poignant quote about condemning these types of people. It boils down to blame and responsibility, which leads to guilt. 

> ""Blame looks for a cause so that its source can be condemned. It does so with righteous anger. It cries out to high heaven that bullying should not be. And it points the finger.""

How we currently deal with bullying transcends outside of OW, but applies to it just as well. We slap blame on someone and then administer justice through punishment, which according to the source, has mounting evidence that punishment rarely works in the long term.

Making it known via a “Hey man, that’s not cool” is completely counterproductive. With this type of wording, a toxic person could misconstrue that as being talked down to, probably exacerbating the problem. This only serves as a mild condescending punishment, like dealing with a naughty kid. Punishing these types of people doesn’t help. Getting called out for being a terrible person puts the responsibility, and the guilt, on them. Rightfully so, but according to the source “guilt is a destructive force in human nature and is rarely reparative and never brings healing.” This suggestion feeds directly into point 3 of bully characteristics. 

**""So then, what should we do?""**


Again with the rhetorical questions. Well what would I do? I would just mute them and move on. But if you truly care about reforming these types of people, the source gives its way on how bullying was resolved. It’s honestly very time consuming and impractical. I doubt you could even do this in the time-frame of a game but you're welcome to try. It’s called the “No Blame Approach”. Basically, have every party involved without condemnation of any party and try to make things right. Try to understand each other.

Let’s say I got called a gook for example. Instead of muting them I could maybe ask them why they have to use words like that (Yeah I'm pretty bad at this, don't hate). Their response will probably be more toxic shit but keep working at it. Eventually, once you actually establish a conversation, try to understand where they’re coming from while also trying to make them understand your perspective. What’s key here is that you don’t try to insult them or make them feel like they're being attacked. Be sincere and genuine. It’s about compromise and making sure both parties feel like they’ve gotten fair representation.  If we’re not willing to listen and sympathize with toxic people, why should they do the same for us? Even if they don't go along with it, at least you tried.

I'm sure there are other well-researched ways to reform toxic people but I've already done too much research for a reddit post. If you're interested, you can educate yourself on other ways but this would be my suggestion on how to curb toxic behaviour. There's only so much we can do as players. Not saying I would be one of those players, but if you are, I hope you succeed. I'll stick with muting and reporting probably. The onus is on Blizzard who I'm sure are much more well versed in this to tackle the problem, but that doesn't mean the community can't genuinely try and help people reform. 

Being self-righteous only does more harm than good. Listen to what people have to say, even if it's hard. Opening a dialogue is the first steps of changing someone's mind. 

This is all my personal opinion. I aint tellin you do anything if you don't want to.

**TL;DR: A peer-reviewed source claims that bullies are characterized by some defining qualities. ""The Girl Problem"" post has a good message but the self-righteous and inconsistent tone of it does more harm than good in how to reform toxic people. The same peer-reviewed source states an actual way to resolve bullying via the ""No Blame Approach"". This approach is opening a dialogue with the toxic person and trying to get both parties to understand each other's perspectives. This is my suggestion for what us players can do to reform toxic players with a scholarly source to back my shit up. Community driven change working in-tandem with Blizzard may see the change we want.**

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I'm going to bed.

EDIT: Hey uh, good morning. Wasn't expecting to wake up to this I'll be honest.

I just want to address a couple things:

- You can't reform someone over the course of an Overwatch game.

I agree, that's why I said it's impractical in my post. But if you make any headway with someone toxic, maybe add them and work with them after a game if reform is your goal? There aren't a lot of things that we as players can do against toxic people. Mostly band-aid solutions. That's why I said the onus is on Blizzard. But doesn't mean you can't try.

- Why should I care about being nice to bullies?

Honestly, you don't have to care. The topic of my post is a suggestion on how to see a long-term positive change. It doesn't mean anyone has to put up with harassment. My post was made for people who wishes to reform toxic people at the community-level. If that's not you, you don't have to put up with bullies' bullshit.

- Why shouldn't bullies be held accountable for their actions?

They should be. Everyone should be accountable for the things they do. But think about what you want out of this situation. Do I want to just silence the bully or try to reform him? Do I want the bully to be accountable for his actions and let my distaste be known? I could confront them but the bully is still the same asshole after the game is over. Do I want to help change this person? Step back and open a dialogue. There is no right or wrong way to do this. It's obviously okay to not put up with abusive people. Address these types of people anyway you want, just have a goal going into the exchange if you want something productive out of it.

- We speak up against bullies to show support for the victim.

I think that's great. I know having homies to back you up makes it a lot easier to brush off toxic comments. However, supporting the victim and trying to reform someone doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. But again, think about what you want out of a toxic situation. Do I want to show solidarity with the victim? If that's your goal, go for it. Do I want to reform a toxic person? You can try and do that too. The topic of this post was to give a suggestion for those who wish to reform toxic people. It's up to you decide whether you're one of those people or not. I've talked about my personal take on this and I'm probably one of those people that won't be reforming, but I made this post for people who want to. 

**I'm not trying to say you have to put up being abused. Nobody has to try and reform a toxic player if they don't want to. This post is simply for those who take a personal undertaking trying to make the OW community less toxic. Also people seem to be misinterpreting what I am saying. I am not condoning or defending bullies. What I am saying is if you want to make a positive change then attacking them won't get you anywhere.**

LAST EDIT: Hello everyone. I doubt people are still reading this 19 hours on but I just want to say thank you for the discussion and I hope that it continues. I'd also like to thank the people who guilded me. It's bizarre to me that people would spend money for this post but I appreciate it regardless. 

I'd just like to say that a lot of the responses have been very constructive and level-headed. It's helped me nuance my own opinion but I won't be changing the original post since I think it's important to keep what the context of the discussion was. This discussion has helped me further shape my opinions on the topic, and I hope that some people have experienced something similar. Whether you support or disagree with what I have to say, I think it's great that people who go into the discussion open-minded might get a new perspective on the topic as well. Many people who disagree with me have valid points that has made me re-evaluate my opinion just as much as those that supported and added their own perspectives to my views.

It all sounds very corny but thanks for taking the time to have a discussion. It's late again, so I'm going to bed.",Overwatch,1525861735.0,t3_8i4wvs

"Every Overwatch hero saying ""gay""",,Overwatch,1522967350.0,t3_8a47p0
Can we please stop bullying Mercy players over the changes?,"To preface, I absolutely think that Mercy was format warping in her impact and her status as a must pick hero at the highest levels of play definitely creates some cause for concern. I'm on board with any changes that they want to implement to shake that up a bit, and nerfing Mercy is an acceptable starting point. I've played between gold and masters in my comp career and while I prefer to play Tank (Winston is what I have the most fun with), I do play a lot of support to fill, which invariably leads to a lot of Mercy play. It is actually quite refreshing that I can play Zen or Moira or Ana now without anyone complaining, but I digress.   
  
What I do want to call out in this post, is the increasing hostility that mercy players are receiving in the wake of those changes. I think it's absolutely unnecessary to parrot the same narrative that Mercy didn't take skill or that they only achieved their rank because she was so powerful. It's quite evident that there is a range of different performance levels for Mercy and having played my share of her and played with many Mercy's over the past few seasons, it's clear to me that some are more capable than others.  
  
What is true about Mercy, is that she is not a very mechanically intensive hero, she's not a hero that requires a high APM or good twitch accuracy to be successful on. Yes the concepts that make up a good mercy player (game sense, positioning, resource economy, etc) are also applicable to heroes who do have more stringent mechanical demands, but just like all skills, not everyone has the same aptitude for everything. There are many players with very good aim stuck in lower ranks because they lack proper game sense or have an inability to provide the much needed leadership at those ranks to organize other similarly flawed players. This kind of takes me to the focal point of this post:  
  
**Accessibility**   
  
Overwatch as a game has been successful in large because of it's accessibility, we see lots of posts on this very sub by people who are new to an FPS genre yet have found enjoyment in this game because the game affords a diverse cast of characters that cater to all different types of playstyles.  
  
To achieve this, they have heroes like Mercy or Winston who have much lower requirements on traditional mechanical skill to be effective, this allows players who might be strong in other areas to provide an impact for their team and feel like they're contributing to the success or failure of their matches.   
  
This is incredibly important for the overall success of the game, and it's not just about appeasing to a casual crowd market. The reason why OWL can be successful is because anyone can feel like they can learn something from watching and feeling like they can reach a higher level of play for themselves, and having accessible heroes be viable is an pivotal component of that.  
  
We already know that many of the other low mechanics heroes (Torb, Sym, Mei) are in the bottom tier of picks based on viability, as we look to re-balance Mercy we have to keep in mind that there are lots of players who do play her because maybe they don't have that really great aim to play a hitscan, and the solution isn't quite as simple as they should 'git gud.'  
  
OW isn't CSGO, having a diverse cast is part of the appeal and the way the game is balanced. For example, look at the current OWL, one of the biggest struggles for SHD in the early season is their lack of a projectile dps player. Diya and Undead are both very good hitstcan players with great aim and reactions but their lack of a Genji or Pharah player to go to has definitely hurt the compositions and lineups they can put out there to respond to other teams.  
  
Not everyone can be like Pine, or aspire to be like Pine, there are real limitations to how good some players can be in some areas, but heroes like Mercy and Winston can give those players the same feeling of contribution to the success of a team. Getting those really great game-saving revives valking out of spawn on the last point of a payload map may not take a lot of mechanical skill, but contributes to the overall sensation of feeling like you were the star of the game and that shouldn't be restricted only to hitscan players. Sure, a Widow or Mcree popping off is incredibly impressive to watch, but many great plays are made by a range of different heroes, a really good riptire, a perfectly placed barrage, great surprise dva bombs, etc, if we don't discount all of those as not being impressive due to their lower mechanical requirements compared to hitscan, then why should we discount Mercy's contributions?  
  
Yes you could say that all the things I talked about before regarding game sense and positioning and all the other non-mechanical skills can be applicable to every hero as well and it's very true, to be successful at Masters+ you need all of those in addition to good aim if you want to be effective. A great mechanical player can absolutely pick up Mercy and be effective if he's got all the other components (we see this with Seoul Dynasty when ryujehong plays Mercy on maps where they want Tobi to play Lucio) while the reverse might not be true, where a very good Mercy player might not be able to become a very good Mcree player, but it's certainly possible for them to become a good Winston player or even possibly a decent Pharah or Junkrat player.  
  
To bring it all back together, I like that the game rewards mechanical skill. I think it's absolutely great when I queue into a really good Mcree or Widow and they carry the team. But I think it's equally important for this game to have viable heroes that are accessible for all types of players to play, and that those heroes have to feel impactful to the outcome of the game.
  
At the end of the day, if a player was playing Mercy at Masters level and winning, I consider them to be a Masters level player, they're playing a role that helps the team that few people want to play to begin with and they free up the dps slots to good dps players. It might be possible that only their Mercy is master's level and that's okay, not everyone plays every hero at the same level.   
  
tldr; Nerfing Mercy, while necessary, hurts the accessibility of the game for players who may be very good at many things but lack strong mechanical skills. We shouldn't undervalue that and dump on those players because the hero they best exerted an impact on has been nerfed significantly.  
  
I'd also like to see more viability increases for other low-to-medium mechanics heroes to keep the game interesting for all its players.",Overwatch,1517511688.0,t3_7ul2cs

Please raise the minimum rank to play competitive.,"Disclaimer ahead of time, I'm mid gold right now, low plat last season. In a disproportionate number of my games, I'm seeing players with 14-20 hours in Overwatch. Total. Across all game modes. They're all too often on my team to boot. And I'm sorry to all the players who are rank 25-40 who might be offended by this...**but they just dont have the experience to be in competitive play**. Some may be alternative accounts, sure. But most of them aren't, as evidenced by their gameplay. 

I just finished a game with a Reinhardt on our team, who had played Reinhardt for 1 hour total, (15 hours total in Overwatch), who refused to let someone else play him, who did not know that his ultimate doesn't go through shields. Every time he used it, there were 1 or more people in front of him who very clearly had shields up (another Rein, Zarya, Zarya shielded member of the team). We're talking about players who don't know the mechanics of the heroes they're using, at a very basic level. He didn't use Firestrike. I don't know if he knew he had that ability.

They're also incapable of being flexible. Most of them have not played over 80% of the heroes, literally at all, not even against the A.I. 

I wouldn't be surprised if some of them haven't seen several of the maps yet. They certainly don't understand how all of the game modes work. 

This simply isn't fair to the teams that get these players. If you have a 2-3 stack on your team with ~12 hours in Overwatch each...that's a couple of friends who bought Overwatch last Friday and binged over the weekend. They're absolutely not ready for competitive play. In my experience (and this is significant enough of a problem for me to be keeping track of this), if a team ends up with a pair of level 30 somethings, that team loses >90% of the time. 

Please Blizzard. I doubt many people will see this, and I don't know what the right minimum level should be, but level 25 is certainly too low. I would *at least* double it.

You know there's a problem with sexism when....,"...you are talking to a couple GM friends and they tell you that you play well enough to be a GM but it will probably never happen in soloq because of how many OW players will decide to not listen to a girl's callouts for the plain and simple fact that she's a girl. 

I love Overwatch. I think there are a ton of great guys and girls in the community. However, there's a much louder minority of people who seem to think sexism is allowed because games are for boys and girls aren't allowed, or are not good enough.

I'm not some one who is a bad player. I've gone from gold to masters as a tank/support flex in soloq and it seems the same across the board. About one in every ten games I experience some sort of sexism from being called a cunt for just asking nicely if some one could switch, to being told I should play mercy because that's all that girls are good for.

"The smurf account issue is not due to lack of protection against people making multiple accounts. It is a result of lack of discipline in quick play. Blizzard, PLEASE add a competitive practice game mode for practicing with heroes we don't often play in competitive.","Many people lately have been complaining about the detriment that smurf accounts have been placing on the competitive experience in gold and platinum skill levels since these players often are of a diamond or higher skill level, yet they create another account to use to play at a lower skill level so they can practice new heroes, but these smurf accounts also throw many games to maintain their SR well below what it should be. Because of the ability to make multiple Xbox Live or PSN accounts on one console, the competitive experience on console literally entails a smurf in every single game, and most PC players do not realize that this is not an exaggeration.


You can usually spot a smurf by identifying a few things: a level just over level 25 which is the level required for competitive, a gamertag that nobody would use as their main account, usually Overwatch related such as ""HanzoMain"" or ""IPlayWidow"", or the fact that they seem to try in one round, only to throw the second so that they don't gain SR which would propel them to their natural skill level where they are unable to practice new heroes. 


Whenever I got these smurfs in my games before--regardless if they were on my team or the opposite team-- I would get irrationally mad that they even existed and I thought they were just there to ruin the game for others, and my whole rationale used to be that I would just report them, block them, and just be mad since there was nothing else to do, but today I was in a game with a guy whose gamertag literally stated he was throwing (I will not put his exact gamertag so that no witch hunt ensues) who claimed to be in the Top 500 on his main account as a Symmetra main. This guy seemed like an pretty good guy and he was in game chat so I asked him why skilled players like him enjoy stomping on us Platinum players on alternate accounts to which he replied with something along the lines of 

>""I don't enjoy it, but that's usually because I don't stop on people since I am not playing the heroes I have mastered in grandmaster, and there are no other ways for me to practice with heroes outside of those I play in grandmaster without getting steamrolled at my main account's skill level.""


Naturally I responded with ""what about quick play,"" instantly realizing how much of a joke quick play has become. There is absolutely no way for someone like him to practice new heroes in quick play since there is absolutely nobody that takes quick play seriously. 


*There is literally no other way to practice with different heroes for those at Master and Grandmaster who are at risk to lose their rank if they play a hero they don't usually play poorly in a game.*


We need a competitive practice mode with the exact same competitive games, the only difference being that you don't gain or lose SR, just like off-season. This would not only benefit these players at high SRs who desperately need to play different heroes, but for us in Gold and Platinum who need these players that don't belong to be removed from our competitive experience.


A competitive practice mode would also open up many opportunities to clean up the toxicity that currently exists in competitive. Players that are suspended from competitive could be forced to earn their privilege to play in actual competitive again by completing matches in competitive practice without any reports. Or, it could prevent players higher SRs from playing heroes that they have no experience playing as whatsoever by requiring, let's say, an hour of playtime with a hero in competitive practice before they can play them in competitive. Also, a competitive practice mode could allow for a smoother transition when adding a brand new hero to competitive since players would be able to gain actual competitive experience with the hero since rarely are there real team compositions to practice against in quick play.


I realize a system like this and some of the ideas I mentioned my have some flaws, but I feel like a competitive practice mode could hugely benefit the competitive experience in Overwatch for everyone.

I can officialy say the ranking system is a joke. Here's why.,"I just went 10-0 in my placement games and was placed at rank 48. I was playing with two friends, they go placed at 68 and 70. How? Because we had a dream comp the whole time. I only played Mercy, they played with Lucio and Pharah. I never got a gold medal. Why? Because my friend was Lucio, and Lucio always does more healing than Mercy. Does that mean he's better than me? No, it just means Lucio excels at healing. My ultimate won us three games... But of course, that doesn't get you any gold medals. If Overwatch is a TEAM-based game, then why are we getting ranked based from the number of gold medals we get? Do I still want to duo support now? No, I dont want to, I want to rank up like everyone else. Is duo support better than solo support? Yes, by far. Just watch pro comps.

TL;DR : current system is garbage. I was placed based off the number of gold medals I got. Doesn't make any sense when you're playing off support, doesnt encourage teamplay.

Edit: another possibility is that it's based off average mercy statistics, wich doesnt makes sense because average mercy doesnt mean they were duo supporting, so their healing done was higher than a mercy sharing the support role.",Overwatch,1467175107.0,t3_4qdrkz

Grouping Defense and Offense is a step in the wrong direction (a suggestion),"One of the hardest things for most players to understand in OW is the idea of *counters and optimal character situations* i.e. understanding what characters are good for what job. This is tough by itself, and I've seen players at lvl 20 struggle as much as at lvl 500 what to pick, and the game doesn't do many favors to help you figure it out. What the Defense and Offense roles did was they helped at least guide players to where certain heroes excel in a general sense, now that extra clarity is going to be lost. Instead, the shift should be towards *more* clarity.

First, let's talk about what we got right now, and who's in what role:

I think one of the best examples of Defense is Bastion. Bastion is very good at holding down a point. His main mode really is Sentry, and in Sentry he's a fixture that deals a ton of damage at a specific point, this point can be a regular Defense Point A or B, it can also be a Payload, but point is that Bastion can lock a point down. However, Bastion is not as strong at taking the point. This is why he's defense.

Now let's look at one of the best examples of Offense - Tracer. Tracer is zippy, she is fast, she gets around and is all about bothering the backline. She is really good at moving and dies immediately when she stands still (150 hp is a meicicle headshot away from a respawn countdown.) That's why she's in offense - she doesn't hold a point down, she moves *to* the point.

Now, the justification of putting Tracer in the same category as Bastion is the word ""damage."" It's true that in most team comps, the fixture is 2 supports, 2 tanks, and 2 ""damage."" However, there's a key distinction in the *type* of damage we're looking at. Junkrat's shield busting damage is very different than Genji's bad time shurikens. Widowmaker's 1 shot per second rifle that she has to stand perfectly still for is very different than Sombra's 3 seconds of sustained fire in a general area machine gun as she runs around. And all of this ""damage"" has different roles. It is not interchangeable. You can counter Reinhardt by sneaking up with Reaper, you *cannot* do the same with Symmetra.

I think the move this game needs is to actually be *more specific* about what heroes do what. There's a lot of confusion around ideas like Winston can counter snipers, or that Reaper counters tanks and stationary targets, while 76 and McCree can deal with mid/longer range targets, or that specific tanks are main tanks (like Reinhardt) while other tanks are off-tanks (like Roadhog.)

What I'd argue for is a new ""tags"" system. Maybe some clever symbols or more of those yellow/red text on the side. Something that guides players to see ""hey, this hero is strong against burst, the enemy team has a lot of burst you could use this against"" or ""this hero is very close range, can deal heavy damage to stationary targets, other players are picking a more melee comp so this is a good pick"" or ""this hero is better at attacking strong backlines you lack any characters that can get there so this could help."" I wouldn't even rule out analysis like ""they seem to have a lot of shields, snipers may not be effective"" (obviously only after enemies are revealed.) There's already tools online that allow you to pick counters, but that's a hassle to do in the middle of the fight, what players need is the ability to see what's the strengths and weaknesses with who they're rolling so they can see why something isn't working. 

Overwatch is a game about finding the right comp for the job. Each hero has specific strengths and weaknesses, and it's often hard to see that. Grouping things into less specific ""damage"" only hurts the ability for players to make snap decisions on who needs what in that critical 40 second setup time, but also when it's time to switch it up mid-game.

Either way, the game needs more info, not less.

EDIT: As it was brought up, I don't think the current Defense and Offense is all that great either, I think it's best to replace the system, but until that replacement is setup, merging the roles is just going to cause a lot of confusion.",Overwatch,1528894277.0,t3_8qs641

Countering high skill heroes with low skill heroes is terrible for the health of the game.,"The two most recent heroes introduced into the game have been supports, which we sorely needed, but the issue I have with these heroes is that they counter the highest skill cap heroes in the game with very VERY little skill required on their behalf. Most of the support heroes in overwatch required very little skill compared to the dps heroes which is why everyone loved the introduction of Ana, because she was really the first healer that was engaging to play for someone that enjoys playing dps heroes due to their skill requirement. 
But ultimately overwatch is looked at as a joke by most other esport communities because in their eyes skill counters skill, but with the introduction of brig and moira thats not the case and I believe that to be destructive to the game overall. ",Overwatch,1525133288.0,t3_8g476s

This is basically just a rant begging for people to be able to adapt to team comps/counter picks.  If you are Widow that is being killed repeatedly by an enemy Tracer, consider switching to a roadhog/mcree/mei or something that will benefit the team while taking care of the Tracer instead of staying as one hero the entire match.

It seems that every day for the past month, there has been a ""Discussion"" post on the OW Subreddit talking about Mercy, usually in a negative light.

Within the past Month, and even before that it was ""Mercy's boosted to GM"" or ""Broken SR gains"" or Mercy gets PotG every match""

And I've tried to clarify or correct the record. I'll point out mechanics, how rez timers and windows prevent these fantastical accusations, I'll sit through OWL matches to go pinpoint the moment the person was talking to see if there was exaggeration (There was) and yet, that information seems buried under ""You're just a Mercy main""

Regardless of what character I play, you can't refute video evidence and basic game functionality.


OK, let's talk about current Mercy, or Mercy 2.1, Old Mercy will be referred as 1.0, and pre-nerf as 2.0.

Just in the past week there has been

-  a post on an article for a second healer, to which the top comment was ""People won't play another healer unless it's an attractive female Mercy mains can identify with"" A lot of people seem to agree with this

- a post saying ""I lock in other supports to avoid playing Mercy even though she feels mandatory"" to which the sentiment was ""Fuck Mercy and Fuck Blizz""

- a post on how watching the OWL has become Mercy only (Despite the match the author mentioned only had 2 rezes on point 2 within 2 minutes and a rez on zenyatta on point 3, to which Mercy 1.0 could've done.)

- how the OW worlds will be ruined because of Mercy being ""mandatory"" (even though Tracer, Winston, and D.Va are seeing super high pick rates in the pro level as well)


I feel like I'm the only one seeing this pattern of people just finding any reason to hate Mercy, down to the people that play her. (""People only play her because she's a blonde hot waifu!"" Bitch please, I don't even like blondes or white women! You don't know me!)
__________________________________________________

- OK, First, just let me address Pro play and Worlds since that's the easiest one;

The pros will run whatever is most effective no matter what. They focus on winning, not on waifus, not on ""mains"" They are in their own world that doesn't affect us. They need to learn to play multiple heroes at such a high level. They may have a favorite, but they do not have loyalty to a character. 

Second point; their have been metas where every team in every match ran 3-4 of the same heroes because of ""lets give ourselves the best chance of winning""  mentality I stated and no one really pointed this out as this huge crippling thing that ""RUINS"" the game or the experience. At different points McCree and Genji were Must-picks, Ana and Lucio were Must-picks, or Ana-S76 nanovisor was a ""must-pick;"" Winston and D.Va were and possibly still are ""must-picks""

Yet, Mercy is seeing the ""must-pick"" status and it's stale, boring, proven how broken she is.

I can't understand this logic.

Metas shift; it happens. The pros will adjust like they always do. You're not losing anything as a viewer, because all you do, is ""view.""

__________________________________________________

- On to her mechanics

Mercy 1.0 could press Q and rez people in an area if they died within 10 seconds. This countered wombo-combos and people tended to focus more on picks and flankers. She never saw much comp play. But just consider that a well timed Reaper ult or Hanzo, or Junk, Zarya (I would say McCree, but fuck that guy) could kill 4+ people by pressing Q. Mercy does the same thing, and it's seen as frustrating. Just throwing that out there.

During Mercy 1.0, Ana was introduced with her 1.0 Nano boost, she became a MUST pick in pro and eventual comp play and people figured out (eventually, took like 5 months) that Ana outhealed a Mercy and gave a huge combat steroid

Zen was seen as a ""MUST"" pick in comp as his orb of discord could melt tanks or anyone if your team had focus (Hah! Not a chance in comp)

Winston has been very strong since launch, and if anyone remembers the days before hero limits in comp or tournament play (I forget which came first) people used to run two Winstons on EACH team.That means 4 ""HI THERE!"" at a time

Mercy 2.0 was overtuned. I said let's give it some time to see and get the data (There were posts within 10 hours of the patch condemning her and saying they ruined her) we got the data, yeah, it was too much.

Now, Mercy 2.1; 30 second static rez, and 1 reset on usage of her ability. It seems fair. You can get more than a single pick in 30 seconds, and if she ults, she gets a boost and a second ult charge.

People are saying this is still strong, how that 2nd rez charge is too game changing and her AOE abilities make teams too strong.

And I roll my eyes and think ""No shit! It's an ULTIMATE ability, it's supposed to be game changing."" Like, a Rein Earthshatter or a Sombra EMP will fuck your team up, lead to about 2-3 kills with follow through. I Nano a Roadhog, and he can get 2 kills easy and never die.

So Mercy has the ability to bring 1 person back, and a bonus on her ult and that's ""too strong."" She has a static 30 second CD, and another when she ults. If it takes more than 30 seconds to get a single pick or kick off a team fight, you're doing something wrong as a team. Hell, fuck it, I'll suicide with Rein every time Charge is off CD and get Earthshatter every 20 seconds. My team/healer will fucking hate me for it, I'll have a terrible KD ratio, but damn it, does it win games.

It then becomes a myriad of excuses which I have to debunk: She gets her ult too fast: In the ""BEST"" and I mean ""BEST"" case scenarios, she can get her ult every 40-45 seconds, but here's the kicker, for 20 seconds, she can't get ult charge, padding that time to best case 60 seconds. 

Because she's in Valkyrie mode. Her Ult duration is countering her ability to rez.

 People may say ""Oh it's her self healing"" to which I say, Lucio has the exact same self healing passively whenever his healing aura is up, which is most of the time. People point to her mobility and I bring up that outside her ult she can only fly to her allies. if her allies are in a bad position, she'll be in a bad position. And flying makes you very vulnerable to hit scan.

Then people say ""only make Rez avalible during her ult"" to which I have to say ""That was how it was before and people bitched in the first place!""

_______________________________________________

Like, I understand reddit is for bitching, I bitch a lot, I wrote a huge bitchy post on how teammates somehow expect me to have even better aim than the entirety of the enemy team combined when I play Ana. (Fuck you Genji)

But let's not get too caught up on the Anti-Mercy circlejerk, it's becoming to the point where it's a dangerous norm to have this vitriol on a character that is 

A) a healer, 

B) accessible 

c) appeals to people playing the game that WANT to HELP YOU!

People should maybe go ""Oh yeah, you want to be the Mercy on team, she can fucking hard carry"" instead of ""Fuck Mercy, she's in every match"" Think about it, you con someone else into healing, and you can blame them for not carrying hard enough.



So yeah, let's pump our brakes and go back to hating Hanzo.

I kid, (maybe) but yeah, we need to tone down the rhetoric for a bit; it's getting to Dead Sea levels of unneccesary salt for all sides: Mercy mains, Mercy Haters, and the people who are just here for the dank memes.

"Sombra will not be the 23rd playable character, It'll be Guillermo Portero.","I think Sombra will not be a playable character, and instead is just a plot device to reveal new playable Heroes.

I posted these observations last week, on the day the ARG expanded into Lumerico's website:

1) Everyone thought Sombra was going to be the first new hero, but it turned out her hacking revealed Anna's weapon and kit, leading to Anna's reveal.

2) In the ARG, Sombra specifically calls out Guillermo Portero as being a villain, who is using Lumerico as a front to gain power. 

3) The emails point to November 1st as being the day that Lumerico turns on the powerplant / ziggurat. Also, he is trying to get his own employees to take vacation around the same time. If this is all a front as Sombra seems to believe, could it be that Guillermo is using this energy source/machine to secretly empower himself?

If November 1st is seemingly when the new playable hero would be revealed, wouldn't it make sense that the playable character would be directly tied to this event?

Would it make sense for the event to happen and create a new playable character, or would it make sense for Sombra (and us) to successfully stop the event from happening, and Sombra just going ""welp, all that secrecy and hacking worked. Let me grab a submachine gun and fight against a giant ape."" Which leads me to my final point....

4) Sombra takes extraordinary steps to stay hidden, and states that information is power. Why would she ever reveal herself and physically fight in battles? She would be giving up something that she's incredibly skilled at and has continually worked out for her.

Of course, the counterarguments are that she was already leaked in that screengrab along with Junkenstein's Revenge, and there is reference to her in the voice lines. But this might be a purposeful misdirect on Blizzards part, or just simply that we all started assuming Sombra would be a hero, just as we did before Anna was revealed.

That all being said, the more I think about it, the more it makes sense. Sombra said she'll reveal more info about Guillermo Portero to the media this week. That sounds very on the nose, and a hint that he'll be revealed this week as the 23rd playable character.

How do you think the community would react if Sombra was not a playable character?

Let them turn far, but not 360. Like they should have a weak spot behind them; as in, they can't defend themselves from behind so they can be taken out.

What you people need to realise is that only praising and white knighting Blizzard wont help the game get better.,"This is why some people speak their mind. Yes yes, we get it, you fucking love this game, we know, its all we see on this subreddit, POTGs and threads thanking blizzard for x or for y.

But for all the people that get insulted when they call Blizzard out for what they believe to be non-optimal or flawed, hear us out: 

- First off you need to stop using to word FREE. I keep seeing posts and comments claiming you get all these heroes and maps and modes for free. No you dont. You payed for it. In fact, thats exactly what you paid for, heroes, gamemodes and maps. None of that is free. The fact that new maps get released without extra charge, is indeed impresive and we should be thankfull for, in this DLC filled game world these days. But make no mistake about it, none of that is free. That is exactly why you payed 40 bucks for it. If you consider all these things to be free, then what, mind you, have you payed 40 bucks for if all of this is free?

Yea...


- Second, if people only overpraise and talk about the good things, none of the bad things will ever be fixed, because the devs only see praises and think everything is peachy. Let me give you an example : Now a few months ago in Heroes of the Storm (another Blizzard game) they introduced something called the map rotation. They would take out a few maps for a month and rotate them. Suffice to say the people werent happy and they started complaining about it. Guess what? They removed that shit, because we called it out, because they saw the majority of the community disliked it.

We didnt just hide behind a fucking kiddy blanket and say ""Nah man, lets look at all the other great things Blizzard has done with this game, so lets all just bury the bad things under the bed""

MORALE : Just because 1000 things are amazing, doesnt mean we shouldnt call them out for that 1 thing that is bad. Why not have 1001 amazing things? Why forgive someone for a sin just because he has done 50 miracles? 

If i save 3 people from drowning but 2 months later i rob a bank, should i be forgiven just because i once was a good lad? Fuck no


We should call them out when they make mistakes so they can see and aknowledge what the community wants.

I understand yall love the game, but learn that without criticism the game can not get better, only worse. Your overpraising, fanboism is doing more harm than good and the problem is you dont even realize it. Belive you me, Blizzard knows how much yall love this game, maybe its time to give them feedback on how they can improve also? Everyone is criticising it because they want it to be better, not because they have nothing else better to do. 
Im not saying everyone should take out their fucking pitchforks and start a war, just stop insulting everyone that doesnt instantly ass kiss Blizzard and make karma-farming threads entitled 

""Thank you Blizzard, i spent 100 dollars and i finally got that 1 skin that i wanted"" - This shit aint right!

Remove the weapon swap for Mercy.,"With the addition of Brigitte and her shield bash ability I feel that Mercy should get one last buff that will make her more accepted as a suppport in this new up and coming meta. I have been frustrated with the design for quite some time that a weapon swap must take place for Mercy to contibite to team damage output outside of just boosting another teammate. In my eyes this is how this can and should be achived by the OW devs. 

Combine Boost and Heal to the same button. Similar to how Brigitte can primary fire normally, hold her shield up, or hold her shield and then bash attack, Mercy would get the same treatment, Primary fire now becomes her pistol, Boost would become heal, and holding primary fire while healing changes the beam to a damage boot beam. This would increase the skill ceiling of Mercy and allow for faster reaction times to the many changes that we will see in the near future meta. 

Overall I think this would be the final piece of love for all Mercy mains and flex players that would keep her from falling to far away from the lime light and make her even more fun to play.

People are finding things to complain about for the sake of complaining.,"I am going to get downvoted to eternity here but whatever I gotta speak my mind here

I feel like a lot of people are just looking really hard to find stuff to complain about. Like for example, we have been begging for 2CP to be removed for years: its a shit mode. Blizzard finally does that and suddenly ""oh no blizzard removed fan favorite map Hanamura!!!"" like BRO. It is not a favorite and it is still in the game through custom games, Blizzard even said they have future plans for them. Another thing was the removal of medals, there's literally a scoreboard now where you can see everyone and there's no denying medals increased toxicity. 

Then there's the camp of ""omg was this playtested before launch??"" ""This hero is broken wha wha wha"" like as if they haven't been patching the game based off of the Overwatch League over the course of the last 5 months. 

I feel like a lot of people are just wanting to be upset about Overwatch one closing. I'm sad too. But after years of having no content we're finally in a position to have stable content drops and y'all are unhappy now, despite the games balancing being in arguably a great state, 5v5 being better than 6v6.

Should xQc be removed from the league?,"Before any mod decides to delete this post for witch hunting or similar content, let me assure you THIS IS NOT A WITCH HUNT, and this post is entirely within the rules of this subreddit. The objective of this post is to get the users to think logically about why xQc (and players on similar positions) should or not be banned, and why he hasn't been banned from the league.


That said, I would also like to keep the discussion civil, please no hate speech, or insulting just because you disagree with any given opinion on this thread.


So, let's start!


The first logical premise WE NEED to state is the following: **You don't decide what is appropriate, Blizzard, OWL, and teams do!** The most common and upvoted comment is that xQc is a professional player and should act accordingly. So let's analyze if he is indeed breaking any terms of use and NOT acting accordingly, rather than actually assuming he is. Sounds good?


[Blizzard EULA](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/eula) is a great place to start. Blizzard doesn't seem (or at least I couldn't find it) to have an Overwatch EULA, so this will have to do. From clause C.x, the EULA talks about harassment, and describes it as **""“griefing,” abusive behavior or chat, conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others, deliberate inactivity or disconnecting, and/or any other activity which violates Blizzard’s Code of Conduct or In-Game Policies""**.


Well, it is clear that xQc is breaking the EULA here. So let's take a look at what the punishment for this is. From clause C: **""Blizzard may suspend or revoke your license to use the Platform...""**


It also seems that he is receiving the appropriate punishment according to the EULA. So far, there is nothing that is arguably wrong, he is a player breaking the rules, and he is being punished accordingly.


So, let's dive right into the second point. Is he actually as a pro player not acting accordingly? As we agreed before, we do not decide what is acceptable, OW, OWL, and Teams do. Therefore, let's play by their rules, and take a look at the [ESL EULA for the Open Division Tournament](https://account.eslgaming.com/terms-of-use). Unfortunately, I couldn't find (nor do I think that it is available) the terms of the Contenders League, so this will have to do.


I would like to quote something from the ESL EULA about how players should act, but as we can see, there is nothing that could be used in favor or against xQc in this current incident. But keep in mind that is for the ODL, and the EULA for the OCL may be different, which means it could potentially have information on how players should act outside of the league, as a public figure. However, we don't have access to this information, so logically, let's not speculate based on hate and let's stick to the evidence we have.


The second point we must address, is that xQc is a character. It is clear to anyone that has ever watched anything besides a youtube clip of him raging, that he is acting. He is exaggerating in order to produce humor. If you find it humorous or not, it doesn't matter, we are not discussing the value of his entertainment content, as that would be very subjective.


Leading from the previous point, we can safely infer that Dallas Fuel, at the time when a contract was signed by xQc, knew this. Therefore, we can also infer that Dallas Fuel, as an organization, is ok with his previous and current behaviour.


So, what can we take from this? First, we, users of the platform, players of the game, do not dictate what is right or wrong, what is acceptable or what is not. We, as every other player (this includes pro players), are bound by the rules of the game that we agreed upon acceptance of the EULA. The Blizzard EULA has greater power than our opinion as players. Let me say it once more: it is us that are bound by the Blizzard EULA, not the Blizzard EULA that is bound by us. So do not try to place what you think is right about what actually is, and use that as an argument.


Second, xQc, as a player, has broken the rules stated by the Blizzard EULA, as has been punished accordingly, as he should. Anyone who tries to disagree is simply being irrational. However, that is it. You can't judge his professional career based on an EULA that is designed for normal users.


Third and last, the ones who can actually decide whether or not xQc has acted poorly and should have his professional career suspended are none other than the League he is playing and his team. However, as none of them have expressed such interest in punishing them for such action, we can safely assume that their contracts do not see it as a case for punishment.


Well, that's it. Pretty big wall of text, probably gonna die in fresh as the conclusion that we can take from looking at the evidence is quite the opposite opinion that Reddit has from xQc. If you want to discuss, link more evidence, or make any kind of argument, be it in favor or against what has been expressed here, you are welcome as long as sources are linked and it is logically sustained.

This might be an unpopular opinion but I am so happy to not have to filter away a sea of PotGs just so I can get to the good and valuable discussions anymore.,"During the open beta and right after launch I was incredibly turned off by this subreddit because there was almost never anything of actual value posted on this sub. Right now on the front page we have real actual good and valuable discussions going on which I think is so much better than 20 videos of someone doing some silly things in the game (which indeed often are funny, but it's not really all that valuable in my opnion).

Some examples of the good discussions going on that may or may not have made the front page before:

+ The Zenyatta ulti discussion
+ The reminder to take care of out wrists
+ Mei wall abuse (game breaking)
+ A good and healthy discussion thread about the highlight policy
+ A video that teaches new Phara mechanics
+ DVa balance discussions
+ More game breaking Reaper teleports
+ Discussion about Symmetra sounds

But in there is also a healthy mix of highlights and humor threads as well so I really think the content of this sub has gone up quite a bit in quality lately and I appreciate that.

"Please... Leave the ""Elitism"" out of Quick Play.","I never thought I would need to post this as the general consensus when it comes to playing what you want and having fun (in at the very least HotS), is ""Go to quick match"", but can we please try and keep the elitism out of Quick Play?

I understand competitive mode where special tactics and team-play are first and foremost is not available, and I truly am sorry for that. Why does that make you feel the need to start berating others when they don't choose the heroes you would like them to or when one player might not be playing the right champ, at the right time for any one map?

Quick play is for fun and quick drop in/drop out games. It is not intended to be a competitive game mode even if the whole point of the game is for trying to win. It's perfectly okay if you're working on your competitive side of the game early, but if you are going to do that please keep in mind that not everyone shares the same mindset as you nor do they have any inclination but to play the game the way they want to. If you can't do that for whatever reason, find 5 others with the same mindset as yourself and start practicing against other pre-mades. 

Now before anyone jumps to the conclusion that I play anymore than one here, I'm not the type to stick to one hero in any game, and often do go into some of the lesser sought after roles like tank/support when the need becomes available and I'm feeling up to it. The rest of the time, I'm going to play the hero I want to play because I want to have fun at the end of the day. I didn't purchase the game to further your personal need for growth competitively, so I apologize ahead of time if my own or other players that share the same mindsets performance is lackluster in your eyes.

tl;dr - it's not much that I'm asking for, I just want to be able to join a game, have fun and not have the 10 Commandments of MLG flared at me.",Overwatch,1464879232.0,t3_4m7j9e

"The battle pass seems pretty fair to me, is there something I’m missing?","In general, I’m alright with paying for battle passes in games I love as long as they are priced fairly and can be reasonably completed within its duration. With Activision being Activision, I was a little worried that the battle pass would be crappy, but it seems to me that it might be reasonable. A lot of people disagree with me though.

From my understanding, It basically equates to about $5 a month, or less if you put some of your freely earned coins towards it. In exchange, you get tons of cosmetics, instant access to the new hero (if the pass contains a new hero), and a boost that helps you complete the pass faster.

If you don’t pay, you still get a handful of cosmetics, and can earn the new hero by progressing the pass. Since the hero isn’t available in competitive play for a bit after release, I’m assuming you’ll probably have time to earn it before it’s available, or at least very close to that time. In the meantime, you can still practice the hero in most arcade modes.

And if the issue is more that new heroes are stuck either behind a paywall or a grind to a certain battle pass level, you could always opt to purchase every other battle pass (since heroes will only be on every other one), reducing costs while still getting access to each new hero instantly.

At a glance, it seems like a fair system for a free game, and feels like a decent trade-off in favor of having more frequent (or at least guaranteed) updates compared to OW1, and a larger selection of cosmetics releasing frequently.

So is there anything I’m not understanding correctly? Is the cost of the pass the issue? Is it the time commitment? Or are the issues more related to the ethics behind FOMO and monetization in general?

I don’t mean to insult anyone here, I’m just trying to understand why people are so upset.",Overwatch,1663265650.0,t3_xf3ppi
Overwatch 2 is going to be made pay to win by Blizzard,"Now before you downvote me because your hyped up on hopeium, hear me out-
 
1. Blizzard already did it with the new diablo game, a series of excellent alphas and betas, and then they drop it with some of the worst ptw ever seen. I don't see why they wouldn't do it again either, they have already gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars off of morons trying to progress for free.

2. With all the money they had to have put into development, I can't imagine a battle pass making up for that quickly.

3. Name a good free to play multiplayer game without loot boxes or ptw (pay to progress counts as ptw in my eyes), that's right you can't. The only way I could see a free to play, non ptw Overwatch 2 going is the way of Fortnite... Popular for a while, but swamped by toxic 9 year olds and shit content creators.

4. Several people in Blizzard have already proven themselves to be scumbags, the kind of people who would be fine with exploiting people's love for the old overwatch for a quick buck.

Overwatch 2 needs to adress several serious issues or the game will flop and the franchise die.,"I love Overwatch. I've been playing since Season 1 more or less consistently. I think I can say with a certain amount of confidence that I know this game and today I quit. I don't want to put my opinion on a pedestal, rather the opposite, I want to be perceived as regular player who expresses his frustration with the game and the reasons I quit. Why? If there's a 1% chance for my voice to be heard, then that's worth it, because I honestly love this game so much and I want Overwatch 2 to revive the game badly. Unfortunately there are so many issues in the game at the moment that Blizzard seems to simply ignore for years now that need to be fixed urgently, otherwise OW2 will release, people will flock for the hype and leave again after 2 months.

*Smurfing is cheating and it needs to be officially forbidden*

Smurfing in competitive is cheating, plain and simple. It's not tool-assisted cheating but that doesn't make it one bit better. The players who play against smurfs can't differentiate between an aimbot and Kenzo ruining games for the lulz on his youtube channel. It's pretty pathetic that every single ""name"" in Overwatch has a ""Bronze to GM"" series on their channel in which they entirely destroy every single game in their placements, start out in high diamond and reck everyone there while giving the lowest amount of usable advice I have ever witnessed in an ""educational"" series, which only shows that these series are simply an excuse to dominate lower rank players. What would the public think about a professional soccer player, who registers under a wrong name and age in a childrens league, dominates every single game as an obvious adult and then laughs about the children afterwards? It's disgusting behavior and a mayor factor in the death of Overwatch as it is.

*Cheaters are rampant and the entry price for playing OW is too little*

Keys are available for 15 - 20€, old accounts for 5 - 10€. Cheats are brutally rampant and they are getting better and better. Overwatch needs a consistent entry barrier in the form of stone cold cash and a functional cheat detection system. At the moment it's an absolute embarassment and cheaters can continue to openly wallhack and toggle aim without any form of repercussion. Blizzard needs to act on this issue and either SPEND MONEY (hahaha) on hiring people who manually review hacking reports day and night or SPEND MONEY (hahaha) on a functional Anti-Cheating-System from a third company. At the moment it honestly feels like the playerbase has been left to rot with the hackers and it has felt this way for ages. It's simply unenjoyable to play a game in which you feel like you can't progress or keep up with the other players, only to review the enemy gameplay and see them tracking you through walls for the whole match.

*The game is extremely inconsistent*

Overwatch is inconsistent. Hitboxes are inconsistent, ability ranges are inconsistent, even hit registering (noreg) is broken. Nothing about this game works in one match the exact same way as in another. Health-Bars in the healer UI frequently display the wrong health. Rein ults hit you there and dont hit you another place in match 1 and in match 2 it's turned around. It's demoralizing to no end to get shattered by a rein behind a box and thinking ""ima shatter there next time too, that's a cool trick!"" and you go ahead and nobody gets shattered.

These are only 3 points of what is wrong with this game, though they are the biggest ones in my opinion and if they aren't fixed, Overwatch 2 will flop and the franchise will die. 

I'd love to hear what you guys think about this. But please, for anyone on here smurfing, be honest with yourself, it's simply cheating. I smurfed for a few games last season, which lead me to the conclusion that yes, it's straight up cheating. I'm with you, I just want this game to not die so badly. I associate so many positive feelings and vibes with the game that it actually hurts to see it decline further and further. Thanks for reading.",Overwatch,1585933033.0,t3_fubz9a
[DISCUSSION] Why I think 2/2/2 killed the competitive experience for the lower ranks.,"Hey r/ow brothers and sisters, I need to put a little rant out here as I started to play overwatch again recently but quit because there is a mayor annoyance in the game for me. FYI, I am high gold and have put a total 550 hours into overwatch over the last 2 years.

At first, for someone who gets fun out of winning and climbing and not just general ""fun"" (killing enemies, using abilities for entertainment and whatever unserious shit), 2/2/2 looked interesting and good to me, as it meant the teams were gonna be forced to be ""balanced"" all the time. This sounded nice because before the lower ranks were full of unbalanced teams filled with 4 dps's, an off-tank and maybe one healer. Climbing was extremely hard, even as someone who flexed, because the outcome of the game was too much influenced by luck (as in, having teammates who were willing to flex for the better and tryhard).

I however have changed my mind about 2/2/2. It was clear before that because of generally seen as more fun, taking up more than half of the role roster and usually also more diverse the dps role was way more popular. This also showed in the waiting times where waiting for a competitive game on healer/support would never take more than 4 minutes, whilst waiting for a dps game takes more than 10.

This is the problem. The huge amount of dps mains and people who prefer dps roles over the other two are flooding the waiting times. Where I still flex and also enjoy playing dps once in a while, I can crack up some patience for a dps game. There is a lot of stuff you can do in 10 minutes while you have the queue searching in the background.

There is a far more problematic solution for the playing-for-fun dps mains though, and it is queueing for tanks, only to pick wrecking ball, d.va or, my most despised hero at the moment, that annoying fat f\*\*\* of a roadhog. These players pick tanks as they don't have the nerve to wait 10 minutes and just want to get some kills. Actual progression and climbing in the ranks doesn't really seem that important to them, and it annoys other players, including dps mains, who do try-hard and want to climb.

Why these players don't just play arcade or qp will remain a mystery to me. Today when I was playing dps I kept getting 0 heals, and I realised that the problem did not lie with the healers being bad, but the healers getting picked off constantly. I asked the tank players (who were running roadhog and wrecking ball) if they could switch to help the healers or try to peel more. The roadhog responded (which was surprising as these players also usually cut out all communication and act like overwatch is a singleplayer game). He told me that he doesn't play shield-tanks because he sucks at them, they are boring and you can't get kills with them.

When I told him that that was the whole point of shield-tanks he said he knew and realised that, but he didn't want to play for what actually mattered more. He just wanted to play for **fun**. And when I asked why he didn't queue for dps, he literally said that he didn't have the patience to wait 10 minutes for a game.

I sadly did not get the chance to ask why he decided to play ranked anyway if all he cared about was fun but it doesn't matter. I know this is not just *my* problem, a lot of people in my rank are struggling to climb while they do try their best and focus on improving because of inner team conflicts. I hope that this problem will be slightly gone when the *while you wait* feature is added, while I do not believe it is gonna do much as somehow these players still just want to play ranked but just for the lulz of it.

If I were to make any suggestions to fix this, I'd actually ask for blizzard to just remove 222 again. This would not fix the unbalanced problem and yes shit like GOATS would probably come back, but it would at least not ""force"" (as these impatient dps players perceive the 2/2/2 system) players onto filling roles they actually don't want to play. What also could help is put something like dota 2's minum amount of hours before playing ranked into overwatch. This way players would have either put a lot of effort into the game to start playing competitively, or realise it's actually not what they want and make them realise they're better of playing the other side of overwatch.

Anyway I want to thank the 10 people who read this for taking the time to read it. It felt good to finally have a good rant out here and I'm just gonna do some other stuff in the meantime untill *while you wait* is out of ptr and then I'll see.

Have a good one.",Overwatch,1575303838.0,t3_e51cuo

Livestream Disaster: A Run Down On What Happened,"I sat through the livestream to see what was up with the reveals they were doing. I listed down some of the things that stuck out throughout the whole thing. (Scroll down for the tdlr)

-The PvE gameplay reveal hardly showed any gameplay, which was gameplay of a mission we already saw previous gameplay of. People were obviously vocal about it. There were a few behind the scene things for all the 3 missions, with tiny looks into said other missions, but that’s about it. Also they are sticking to the monetization they are going for with it as said monetization was not spoken of once.

-The hero mastery reveal proved to be lackluster for people as it appeared to look very bland in design. People pointed this out and said that the basic geometry and textures made it look like it was rushed. It didn’t help that there is a low initial count of heroes available for the hero mastery missions.

-Event missions were revealed as replayable missions set after the completion of the main missions. This was an indication that the story missions were most likely not replayable, so this only sparked people’s fury.

After these three reveals, the stream was put into slow mode and a mod told people to chill.

-The new PvP mode, Flashpoint, and maps were revealed, which were the only genuine new things that were showcased. New map designs with some references snuck in. They went into depth into how Flashpoint works and people didn’t like it as it boils down to “3CP but the points’ locations are randomized”. People complained and began spamming copypastas.

-No additional teasers on the new support coming next season, which was something the PvP focused players primarily looked forward to aside from Flashpoint. No balance changes were addressed either. 

After threats of boycotting and hate comments, the stream went into subscriber-only mode. Yes, this did not help to keep said things away.

From there some final comments and thoughts were chared by the devs on stream, with no final cut to any extra teasers for season 6. Even after a minute from the stream ended, 12k people stuck around before the chat was shut off.

To sum it up: Devs show what was mostly already seen, showed only small amount of content people liked in the majority, and the stream blew up (in a bad way) to where the stream mods could not contain people’s hate. It was a disaster.",Overwatch,1687374806.0,t3_14fgij7

I'm a Lol Caster and here is my small Feedback from what i've seen.,"Hello Reddit! I'm Vecet and i'm a Caster for the League of Legends amateur scene in Brazil, also a content creator for a lot of games mostly MOBA's. To make it clear i'm not on the Beta for Overwatch but i've been watching a lot and talking to a lot of friends who are playing the game a lot, and i've been gathering feedback and taking notes on many topics to post it here. I hope to make my self clear on my opinions but i can make some mistakes since english is not my first language, feel free to correct me and i'll edit the post. Let's get started!

 &nbsp;

**Spectate**

 &nbsp;

* The competitive scene will depend on how delightful the game is to the Viewers, right now it's kinda messy, there is too much going on at the same time on the screen, i would recommend an option to make effects less fancy, also would be nice to have a mini-map on the righ botton corner of the screen soo people can see the overall of the match to try to figure out what is happening.
 
* I also suggest changing the Character's icon positions on the screen, make something like this one [Click Here](http://i.imgur.com/S1YVurX.jpg) Also its not really necessary to have the shortcuts to each Hero displayed on screen, or at least give an option to hide it.

* Let us have a option to hover the mouse on a hero portrait or just a quick access menu to look up some statistics, believe me, for the caster's that a huge help.

* Give the ability while on Spectate to see throught walls, just outline the caracter's soo the caster and the viewers can get a better experience.

* One thing that everyone says that is missing and i totally agree is the Kill Feed, this game need a Kill Feed asap. Would be great to have a warning on screen for the spectate when a player change it's Hero.

* A cool extra would be the ability to synchronize both caster and commentator cameras, soo when making online tournments they can have a better understanding about what is being transmited to the Viewers.

* Another change focused to the Esports side of things would be change the some of the announcements to the *Double, Tripe, Quadra, MultiKill* system, that would help the caster's to Hype the plays happening on the screen.

About the way the spectate handles the camera system;

* When the match starts a quick automatically introduction would be cool: Showing some of the objectives and then going back to the team bases.
* Give the caster some cameras preset and shortcuts for it. That way the can quickly navigate through the map instead of flying all the way to where they want to be.
* A little delay on the spectate would be cool soo the client can define some interesting plays to quick move the camera and show to the Viewers.

 &nbsp;

**Game itself:**

 &nbsp;

* Hability to save Match Replays is a must.
* Auto-save or a button to save the Play of the Match, will help a lot of content creator's and a lot of pp who want to show their best plays to the friends.
* Let people select what Voice chat they want, like only talk with their party member's.
* I dont know if this one is in the game yet, but make possible to people can report toxic players.
* The card system is not rewarding to people voting but arent in the cards, with time a lot of people will just leave it there and not vote at all.
* The Ragdoll system used when Heros die seems a little off. Dont know how to explain that.
* This game will need Events based on Lore update to keep it alive, that's some i want to see Blizzard invest a lot!
* Dont know if it's possible already but make possible to people select the language they want to play the game. Also please keep the same character names in every region. Change names will make Viewers confused if they want to watch some tournment on another region.
* If Blizzard really wants to experiment a lot of gamemode variants, please make a truly custom mode, where people have a lot of variables to set and make some unique matches.

I hope my feedback will be of some use, i may have made some mistakes since i'm not in the beta but i do want to help to make a better experience for the player's and a great Esports.

Tank role is dead and absolutely terrible to play,"tl;dr: Tank is the worst role to play in the game by far since in the transfer to 5v5, none of the controversial abilities in ow1, got reworked or straight up removed and now they all just make playing tank miserable. No one wants to play it, it isn't fun, and it hasn't been fun since the switch.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ya know I never realized it because I was GM1 at one point and bouncing back and forth between that and GM2, but I was still top 500 and I thought ya know give the season some time. It'll all raise up to GM1 requirements to be top 500 for tank...

I dropped to GM5, shit happens, I got burnt out from the state of this role and ended up soft throwing games not on purpose but just from sheer droppage of giving a fuck about the game. And I been slowly climbing back up.

GM4, go 5-1, hit the rank up. Nice! I then see I got put into top 500 from that... my first thought ""Damn... I went from GM4 to GM1 even after dropping this low and this many games?"". Surprise surprise, I didn't jump shit. I went from GM4, to GM3 and tank top 500, STILL starts at GM3.

We are THIS deep into this season, and tank t500 still starts at GM3. Both the other roles? Entire top 500 is GM1. You're telling me THIS deep into this season, we can't find 500 GM1 tank players? With 25 wins to qualify to enter?

I mean it's so evident no one wants to play this role. Hell, I BARELY wanna play it, but I do since they moved my main into this role so... it is what it is. But Jesus, it's bad.

5v5 has been nothing but terrible for the tank role. There's no flexibility for what you want to play. You play what's at least top 3 in the role, or you don't win. The only way you win playing anything else, is if you were already going to win that match anyway because the enemy team was just that much worse than yours. Tank has dwindled down into just getting ass blasted by every boring and dogshit ability in this game.

Constantly anti, constantly slept, constantly hindered, constantly hacked, constantly discorded. And what a SHOCKER it is, that a solo tank, can't fucking handle all of that garbage on their own. Who would've thought that going to 5v5, and yet not changing any of the things that fundamentally only worked in 6v6, would be a problem? I mean even some of the shit that's straight busted in this game, it's not like they were safe in ow1 either. Discord has ALWAYS been a problem, how no person at blizzard saw that discord would be an even BIGGER problem with one tank, is beyond me.

And watch, we'll get someone here to say ""oh give it more time it'll raise up to GM1""

When we have to wait til the final month if not even LATER, for the top 500 to cap off at GM1, just because we have to wait for more GM1 tanks to hit 25 wins because people wanna not play this role THAT badly. There is a CLEAR problem. Especially when no other role is struggling with this. DPS? Capped off at GM1. Support? Capped off at GM1. It is atrocious.",Overwatch,1689045395.0,t3_14wf902

ROLE SELECT QUEUE: I think its time,"I know what you are thinking...""this will force a meta"", ""it will ruin matchmaking time"", etc... hear me out

I think its time we add this feature to the matchmaking for COMP (100% needed) and QUICK PLAY (make it standard for QP and add a new FFA QP where role select is disabled)

Let's be honest. We all hate when we get into a game and 4 people instantly lock in Genji, Tracer, Hanzo and Widow. Its gonna be a bad game for everyone and Im sure those 4 people would like it better if they had tanks and healers to support them. 

ROLE QUEUE WILL FIX THIS PROBLEM!

However...I think the only way to do it would be to add a 4th role to pick from. 

1) Tank
2) Healer
3) DPS
4) Fill/Flex

Players will be able to choose ANY 1 ROLE or ANY COMBO they wish, or they could even select ALL 4 ROLES.

Explanation: The goal of the matchmaker at this point will be to create a team that has at least 1 dedicated support, DPS, and tank and at least 3 players with the FILL/FLEX option selected. 

So say you really want to play DPS because thats what you are good at. Regardless of ""one tricking"" or not, you choose the DPS role and queue up. The matchmaker will now try to form a team that will be able to support you.

This role select however is NOT SET IN STONE. It DOES NOT lock you into whatever category you selected. This system should be put in place as nothing more than a STARTING POINT for a team comp. 

You might have queued up for a support role ONLY and once you get into game after talking it over with your team, you might end up playing DPS. The goal here is to put 6 people into a match who are **comfortable enough to select the roles that need to be selected** regardless of what hero they want to play. 

Again, this does not force any specific comp or meta, it is simply a starting point for a balanced team comp. You might end up with 2-2-2, 3-2-1, 1-4-1, etc. 

Once you get into the game, when you press the TAB/INFO screen, above each player you will be able to see what ROLE/ROLES they selected when they queued up so it will help your team quickly figure out what everyone wants to play. 

IF you are running a 6 stack with your friends and you all pick DPS, when you queue up, there should be a pop up saying that you might not have enough players to fill all the roles and your team might be at a disadvantage. 

This is also the time to add a READY BUTTON FOR YOUR PARTY!!!!!!!! ( WHY IS THIS NOT A THING ALREADY)

When your party leader hits the button for QP or COMP, everyone in the party must select READY/ACCEPT before the queue will start! If not all people are ready, matchmaking will NOT begin.

Heck...I would even like to see this feature for solo queue. Ive accidentally hit the comp queue without meaning to, only to be immediately thrown into a game which I was not mentally ready for. A simple popup would be nice. ""You are about to queue for Competitive/Quick Play. Are you sure? Yes/No"". This would be a great way to back out in case you accidentally hit the button. 

I can't be the only person that wants something like this. Please let me know what you think. I really think its time we start encouraging better team comps. 


BONUS THOUGHTS: Maybe EXTRA XP or COINS for hitting that Fill/Flex button. 
World of Warcraft has a system like this where if the matchmaker is lacking in people who want to play a certain role, they get extra rewards if they pick that role and PLAY as that role.

"Keep in mind that when the second wave of lore will be released, the inclusion of new characters will be impacted permanently.","Everyone is pained because of the slow release of lore at the moment, but keep in mind that for now, Overwatch's universe can still be pushed in any direction. It is fresh out of the oven and anything can be done with it. People have critiziced Chu's choice of slowing the short's release to ""keep artistic freedom"", but this might mean more than people think.

When lore starts to be released, the story of what happens with the characters and the universe will be set in stone, with no possibilities of reboots or spin-offs. And every characters, maps, whatever from then will have to be designed accordingly to fit with Overwatch universe's story. This will likely massively slow down the coming of new characters, and since the lineup utterly lacks of tank and support heroes, they cannot afford this at the moment. 

The amount of DPS is incredibly surprising nowadays, but keep in mind that Overwatch was originally going to be closer to the gameplay of games like Team Fortress, rather than an usual Tank / DPS / Healer meta. In TF they only have one ""Tank"" and one ""Healer"". They clearly did not expect Overwatch's meta to shift like it is nowadays, and you can tell just by going back and looking at things like no hero limits, or the defense category, etc.

Keep in mind that a roster of 28 characters is very hard to all include in a story timeline with a equal amount of time. Some characters WILL be left out in the story, while others will be the main focus. Characters will also die and birth as the story progresses. And, while it is obvious that the in-lore dead characters won't be removed from the game, they will never appear in any of the story elements ever again.

Some people have expectations on the story, usually based around their main. But most of these things will never happen because a story can only get you so far. Maybe D.va will never meet Bastion. Or maybe Torbjorn will never be the focus of any point of the story, or maybe Rein will die at the beginning, never to be seen again, etc. A lot of people will be disappointed by what happens in the definitive, never to be altered again story.

So, for now, it is understandable that they may want to carefully plan their releases of lore, because, obviously, the future lore of overwatch is as much of a work in progress as anything else is.

Increase minimum level for competitive to 90,"There is absolutely NO reason to have it that low. It lets unskilled noobs who don't even know the layout of the maps to be pitted against good , knowledgeable players. It allows smurfs to quickly make accounts and makes teams completely unbalanced.

 There is no reason NOT to change it. Since the implementation of role queue, quick play has good quality games for noobs to improve their skills.  

So increase it from level 25 to level 90. 25 levels means around 8 hours of playtime. Nowhere near enough time to learn how to play.

If they wanted to take it further, make it mandatory to have atleast 8 hours on two heroes of a role to play that role (ie, if I wanted to play tank I would need to have played Reinhardt and Roadhog , or any other tanks for 8 hours each).",Overwatch,1579454706.0,t3_eqz6nd

When you consider that every character in the game has straight counters, it doesn't make sense to play one hero exclusively. Add in the fact that you can swap at any time, and you begin to see the game as an evolving match of FPS Rock Paper Scissors. If you're stuck playing rock when the entire enemy team is playing your hard counter (paper) you're probably going to have a bad time.

no, I wont stand right near you and wait for an enemy to come.

So you picked support because ""no one else would do it"", so it means you are the best person in the world? No.
it means that you just filled a role in the GAME, where there are more roles to be filled, and if you dont like playing healer, why wont you ask someone else to do it?

and the command ""I need healing"" isnt an insult to your ""skill and awareness"", it just shows where the player is, I play healers alot and if I see that even a genji is SPAMMING it, Ill be happy because I will know where he is. and maybe get some good positioning to heal him. 

not everything is your teams fault, you died alone. you were alone, its the flankers job to kill you, its logical. you died, ""but my team didnt protect me"", well its not their main job to protect you, they can try to if you tell them that you are being attacked but they wont always make it or care, like in a team fight. killing the enemy hanzo+zarya who are ready to combo is way more imporatnt for saving your ass.

Look at my gold elims and gold damage on Soldier 76 give me more SR fuck these stupid teammates!"" Now I used to be this way, stuck around 2.6.

And Zenyatta... Well Zenyatta is how Zenyatta is. His ultimate is... alright.



But the point is people, all the heroes are powerful. And in the hands of a skilled player, every single hero can kick ass and take names. Blizzard has done a good job balancing the heroes and there is no one hero that will always shine above all the others and always kick ass and will always do a good job no matter what the skill level of the player is.

So please stop complaining about some hero being soooooo overpowered compared to some other hero, chances are you're just not playing that hero well. It's like playing Genji and trying to just melee everyone and getting mad when you keep dying. The problem isn't the character, it's the player. ",Overwatch,1465176209.0,t3_4mqi03
There is an overreaction to how miserable tank is with counters.,"For reference, I hit masters on tank this season after starting in silver in the beginning of overwatch 2's launch. The climb wasn't easy but I think one of the most valuable lessons I learned and one of the most common mistakes I see while playing support and damage with a tank is swapping. 

Before I dive a bit deeper: Yes tank is definitely the more miserable role to play compared to the other two and yes sometimes you do have to swap due to enemy counters making the game unbearable, im gonna say this won't 100 percent happen.

Anyway while playing at around gold (maybe plat level) I became pretty hard stuck where my routine was when they went a counter, I would swap after dying to them. A common example was them going reaper while I was Winton. After putting some learning hours online in though through how to deal with counters I began to make it my goal to work towards playing who I enjoy and adapting to counters without swapping, and here is the thing: plat or below, everybody sucks at properly countering. 

Seriously outplaying a reaper + bastion on Winton took some practice and then it became easy because 90 percent of the time **people who counter swap you when you're tank don't main the characters they swap too.** This means they can easily outplayed and downright ignored most of the time. 

Knowing this in my head I began playing who I liked (Winton and Ball) even against all their counters and made it easily to diamond. Bottom divisions of diamond felt the same in terms of counter swaps with zero knowledge as before until I reached the higher divisions where more skill was present - except  with more skills from enemies came less swapping from them as well since they were confident enough with their own character. 

Counter swaps still existed and I still continued to play into them doing fine as long as you adapt your playstyle. This means if they have a reaper + torb, as Winton I won't be diving in even with a bubble, I'll try bait the reaper to come to me while keeping track of the torb's positioned and staying on high ground, then maybe I'll try find a target to jump and if not, both dps are fully focused on me letting my team do whatever they want. 

After hitting masters things stay similar and looking at all the pretty much bot posts on this subreddit on tank kind of confuse me. Tank is a tough role and I think more people need to realize that. After we lost one tank it has clearly become much harder requiring more then just stand in main shooting (unless you're orisa.) 

I really do think more tank players need to adapt to the situation instead of constantly whining about 24/7. The amount of times I see things like an orisa instantly swapping once the because the enemy has a zarya instead of learning to play around her is astonishing. I know some of these players just want to win but I have had more success in getting better with an character then just swapping with tons of different characters that I might not even enjoy. 

To summarise: yes, tank is not in the greatest spot and some games will be swapping and there is simply nothing you can do about it but, its just like the ""my team mates are afk so that why I am hard stuck"" take, it happens kinda rarely. If you do want to win and play the characters you love I highly reccommend just sticking to them and learning (while not throwing games hopefully - I reccommend turning of voice and chats to feel more confident playing characters that get hated on even when carrying like Ball.) I hope this isn't to controversial, it is simply from my real experiences and I do just hope there could be less negative talk on this game all the time because I think everyone would be much happier reading happier takes on the game (and I have really had enough with the copy and paste tank posts.)

"Dear Blizzard, nice try with lucioball, but it's horrible. Please never bring it back.","I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking this. The game mode is terrible, literally everything about it. The pace, the hit detection, and the arenas. They're just a pain to deal with.

Has anyone actually had fun with it or are you just playing for some competitive points?  It's really just a very slow, boring version of rocket league.

I've made an alt account and this is the new player experience:,"Hi, last night I made an alt account to see the new player experience of OW2 and I can tell you its kind of terrible for new players and I feel bad for anyone who chooses to play this without being an OW1 veteran.

You do not have the entire roster of OW1 characters unlocked and they can take up to 150 games to have them unlocked, the last hero you unlock from the base roster being Echo. This is the only part of this progression system that makes sense, you should unlock Echo last.

However. Issues arise with this progression system. The main ones being you not having proper team comp selections or counter picks in a game that has 90% of its gameplay balance being around countering your opponent when equally skilled (look at the tank matchups for prime example).

You also cannot unlock Ram, Kiriko, Queen, Sojourn, or Lifeweaver at the same time. you must ""activate their challenges"" and do them 1 at a time which takes 35 wins each. Not just games. For most players this would be a whopping 70 games per each one of those.

Games being around 10-15 minutes each means the average player would need around 32 hours to unlock the base roster of in game time and around 15 hours per character specifically named above. This does not include queue times and assumes every game is around 13 minutes and a 50% win rate.

Queue times were anywhere from 40 seconds to 3 minutes in length while queueing flex.

There is an additional issue with this system and that being Competitive. It takes 50 Wins to unlock comp. This means you can enter the ranked ladder without having a large number of the roster unlocked and if a new player were to do this, would not know what half the roster does even slightly which is unacceptable. People should at least have the base roster available to them before attempting competitive. If you were a perfectly average 50% win rate you would still be missing (assuming you also activated the challenges for one of the specific heroes mentioned above): Ball, Echo and Sombra. You would have unlocked 1 Overwatch 2 character of your choice.

That's an insane number of heroes that a new player would know literally nothing about and many of them are extremely common in matches as you cannot expect every new player to go into the training range and testing every single character. Most people just want to play and will not be doing that.

Progression system aside, the next issue is that is because it is a Free to Play game now. I've encountered 1-2 people every 4th match or so that are using blatant aim or walls. And when I say blatant, I mean ""how does blizzard not detect that"" blatant. Like Flats youtube video level blatant  cheats. Always on fresh accounts. I don't know if this is because I rolled the actual new player lobbies and it put me in cheater lobbies more often or if there are just ALOT of them. I'd need either additional accounts or more of you to provide additional data.

So my conclusion after this experiment is that if you've experience playing FPS games on PC and decide to pickup Overwatch, you're going to have a regularly terrible time. If you're brand new to FPS games, you're going to get many baby lobbies early on and you'll have a fun time for awhile but you may get bored of the hero selection available to you if you're someone who enjoys trying new things.

I'm happy to conduct additional experiments or answer any questions I did not cover in this explanation

Edit: For the pessimistic among us, no, I am not going to continue playing this account other than any additional questions that may be presented here. I do not enjoy smurfing. This account will not be touching ranked or queueing with any to boost.

Sombra's unlimited invisibility and translocator are strong buff's and people don't realize it because its the PTR,"Ok so everyone seems to be hating on these new sombra buff's and Blizzard allready gave in to some forum critics as they have been buffing her even more and reverted the reveal back to 2 meters from 4 again.

People playing on the PTR are there to try Hammond and other buffs/nerfs on other heroes. The team comps and team work on the PTR are crappy just like solo que quickplay. So the teamwork and cordination is usually pretty bad on the PTR and when I was playing, there was barely any groups in LFG, like maybe 1.

However Sombra with these new buffs and actual team work, she could be scary strong, the new strategies and plays she can make are wide open. I would say most of my pre-buff Sombra deaths currently are because I over commit and continue on in a fight as my translocator times out, and Im left with out an escape. But now with Invisible and Trans being unlimited Sombra is going to be incredibly hard to kill. She will be able to translocate out to safety anytime now. Now that she can relocate trans while invisible the whole time a good Sombra player may be next to impossible to kill.

Now Sombra can harrass back lines endlessly and killing her is going to be a chore. There is not a lot of Counter-Play when it comes to killing a hero that has unlimted Invisibilty and can teleport out at anytime.

So my bottom line is I hope Sombra is not over buffed because people are basing her off PTR play where 1/2 your team doesnt give a crap because they are not able to play Hammond. Remember how oppresive Sombra was with her hack b4 it got nerfed by taking damage that interrupted the hack for a 2 seconds cooldown. There was no counter play for it and it sucked.

P.S. I like Sombra shes one of my core heroes I play. But I dont like heroes that offer little counter play. And with Heroes like Hanzo dominating I really dont want another situation like that.",Overwatch,1530665450.0,t3_8vxfxo
Emre face REVEALED? Hint from Sombra trailer provides a clue?,"After the most recent tweet from the Overwatch team (Operation White Dome), we were hinted with Hero 27. In the action report, a new name was revealed: Emre Sarioglu. 

So there are two theories of who Emre could be!

**THEORY #1:**
Sombra's web has revealed connections before. In it, above the Overwatch symbol, Torbjorn, Reinhardt, and another person are grouped together. Connected to Reinhardt is an omnic that we do not know the identify of, as well. 

Source: https://i.imgur.com/VdwXrsO.jpg

Originally, I thought the icon next to Torbjorn was his daughter, but the skin tone looks slightly different. There's also no strand of web connecting them to each other, and Torbjorn and Reinhardt were said to be on a mission with a third ally. As the only names listed that were from the Project: White Dome teaser, it's likely that Emre's face was revealed in Sombra's web.

A close-up of the trio: https://i.imgur.com/viy3gsb.png

If not that, the omnic is certainly someone we know nothing about it. But that is quite an unusual name for an omnic.

This certainly brings us closer to the 3/20 teased released date.

**THEORY #2:**
 It could also be the mohawk guy  from Ana's origin story, found here (timestamped): https://youtu.be/yzFWIw7wV8Q?t=46s (bottom left)

She was speaking about her team and how they were like family, and how Pharah looked up to them and wanted to join the other heroes, and we know everyone there except for the guy on the very left, and the female on the very right. We know nothing about them, or even their names. While it's entirely possible that they could just be people who are insignificant and serve no purpose other than to make the ""family portrait"" look more full, it's definitely a speculation that this could be a new hero. 


Reminder that these are just my findings, feel free to speculate and add more information or debunk my speculation.

Thoughts? 


[edit]
Emre is a male's name, so perhaps it's the omnic after all. The female grouped with Reinhardt and Torbjorn is Brigitte, his daughter (I wonder why they're grouped up together) - but it seems that she's NOT the teased hero.

Can We Address Streaming And The OWL?,"Alright, I think it's time we have a serious discussion about how Twitch streaming is directly impacting OWL.

First of all, we need to realize that eSports are in a very unique position, in that most eSports athletes are also Twitch streamers. This is a big part of the background of eSports, which is that it has been a very underfunded sport for years. Being a popular streamer is a good source of revenue for many eSports athletes, which gives them time to play their game the amount they need to in order to play at such a high level. I think that recently we, as a community, have developed a huge double standard which is very disingenuous to our eSports athletes.

Recently, xQc, has had a lot of problems because he has been thrust under a lot of extra scrutiny and it's reaching a point that is ridiculous. He was banned because redditors made threads about him sending reports about throwers. This happened multiple times, and it caused his account to be banned, hindered his streams, hindered his practice, and can't be great for his stress levels. Now, xQc is in trouble again for saying something that _he_ did not think was homophobic, he didn't _intend_ as a homophobic statement, and very likely shouldn't have been considered homophobic by any rational person. Hopefully, as a community we can move on from this issue without it impacting the Dallas Fuel, but that remains to be seen.

So, what's the double standard? This idea that people living under a microscope have to be consummate professionals. They spend hours a day being entertainers, and now that they are part of OWL, we expect all of that to change. ""This kind of person can't be in our OWL! He shouldn't represent us!"" Maybe that's true, but I think that most people say things that they wouldn't want spread all over the internet. And I think most people have said things that could be taken the wrong way by others. I know I have said things that other people might not have understood, or they may have thought about in another context. When there is so much hype, about our streamers going pro, but we still want them to stream, but they _also_ have to be _perfect_ ALL THE TIME. It's bull. People wanted Seagull on OWL, then they complained that he didn't stream for months. Yet, people complained about what he would say on stream to. ""You shouldn't say bad things about mercy/tracer!"", or when people say, ""Effect shouldn't talk about his team on stream!"" But they aren't talking about things as Effect of Dallas Fuel, or xQc of Fuel, or Muma of Outlaws, they are streaming for their stream communities.

So, here are our options, as our community:

1) No pro can stream -
     No one can sensor themselves all the time, and it's clearly impacting xQc at least (if you've seen his most recent stream it's pretty clear). And maybe OWL should enforce a rule like that (but they won't because popular streamers wouldn't be part of the league if they can't also stream). 

2) Streamers can't go pro -
     This really results in the same thing.

3) We admit that these people are people -
     These streamers are trying to entertain their audiences. If you don't like what they say or do, don't watch. But let's not crucify someone for saying something on their stream. Their stream should be a safe place for them. Every post saying how X player is a terrible person because they said something on stream, is trying to ruin their life. Please think about how you would react living like that.

tldr; If you want twitch streaming to continue and have a high quality OWL, let's stop witch-hunting xQc and other streamers for things they say on stream. ",Overwatch,1516345015.0,t3_7rglk3
D.Va is too hard countered and generally underwhelming right now...,"I can understand heroes need counters, and I can understand D.Va had none before (not true imho, but that's another story), problem is right now I didn't manage to find a single game wich didn't feature some sort of hard-soft counter in the opposing team, usually there are from 1 to 2 heroes who always counter you and are also very useful by default, the D.Va counter is just a bonus, thus playing her is a complete pain.

The biggest problem is obviously Roadhog, if he's on the map you better be behind your Rein shield 24/7 (thus you are mostly irrelevant) or you will get de-meched instantly (the mech is super easy to grab), if Rein happens to die/gets charged/gets slept you legit have no impact on the fight because you have no Rein shield to hide behind and you will get hooked in the middle of 3-4 people; this is ridiculous imho, it's comparable to 150 HP Tracer/Zen against 150 body shot Widow and I don't think this is fine at all.

Reaper, he's not a problem by himself but if there's another soft counter you can't play against him, because you have to shield his shots and then the other soft counter (let's say Mei) makes you irrelevant.

Tracer: same as Reaper.

Mei/Zarya: usual pain in the ass, nothing new here.

Sombra: this is straight up retarded and almost as bad as Roadhog, hack makes you completely irrelevant, it's extremely easy to hack the mech and she deals tons of damage to you (spread doesn't matter against D.Va).

On top of her reduced 1vs1 potential against Soldier (wich was always able to deal with her 1vs1 anyways).

Hog/Soldier/Zarya is a completely legit and almost standard comp right now, this comp features 2 hard counters and 1 soft counter. You can say ""well play her when only 1 counter is in the game"".

I tell you when exactly? Reaper/Hog/Zarya/Soldier are extremely common picks, Sombra is most likely gonna become common too, so how do you find a game that features even just one soft counter? You don't.

It's impossible to play her right now; actually, it's possible if none of the said heroes are in the game (or maybe if 2 of them are in the game), wich makes it impossible in practice.

It's just extremely infuriating how Ana and Roadhog were comparably strong before the patch, so they hard nerfed D.Va, gave Ana the smallest of nerfs and literally buffed Roadhog.

300 HP/300 armor would be ideal...

P.S. I can understand there are arguably weaker chars that have been weaker for longer time (Mercy, Junkrat, Bastion etc...), i'm not saying D.Va should be prioritized over them, i'm just saying she feels very weak atm.

Forbes analyzes Tracer issue,,Overwatch,1459266575.0,t3_4cg0sp
"The Core Gameplay is causing this ""emptiness""...","First, I would like to say I am well aware that this is BETA and this weekend was meant for stress-testing and a lot of features are missing. But the time for critiques and feedback is especially important during the BETA phase. 

Core gameplay = 6v6 FPS with a various characters with different skills sets


**Is the core gameplay casual or competitive?**

The obvious answer is that its a blend of both, but there are some design issues with that answer. Ex. One of the most prominent thing is the scoreboard/killfeed issue. Its tries to be ""casual"", in a sense, by avoiding to show seemingly extraneous information, but that information is/can be vital to a more competitive audience hence people's frustrations.

A casual game is supposed to be quick, no real commitments, and simple to play. What Overwatch executes perfectly is how quick the games are and how fast you queue into the next one. The problem is being locked into a 6v6 and having to play competitively and communicate with my team to succeed. I am committed to this game/people for the next 15-25 mins. As a casual gamer, I don't necessarily want to talk to teammates... but in a semi-competitive setting the game is almost forcing me to.

Which brings me to... Simplicity of the Heroes.


**The Heroes actually have very shallow game play**

Blizzard did this INTENTIONALLY. They want to cater to wider audience by making the game easier to play. Also by splitting up the abilities and mechanics across a WIDE spectrum of characters, they diluted the skill ceiling across the board which inherently promotes a constant ""hero changing game"". But the characters feel a little TOO striped down. 

In most games you need the basic character everyone understands (casual): Soldier:76, Bastion, Widowmaker, Mercy, and Pharah

But you also need more complex and rewarding characters (competitive): Zenyatta, McCree, Lucio, and Genji

But I argue that once you understand the abilities of the more complex characters, they actually don't offer THAT much more gameplay than knowing when to use your abilities. Of course, you will get better at managing your skills and positioning as you play, but the characters core tends to get stale after a few games then you get bored and switch around and around and around.

A few characters do capture a good mix of casual, but with the potential of being competitive. Tracer is one of the most popular character hands down... partly because she has become the face of Overwatch, but also because she has a fun and unique mechanic. On the surface anyone can understand her abilities, but I can tell the difference between someone who uses it and someone who uses it well. I can not distinguish between a good or bad Pharah in the sky raining down on me. Its wanting to improve on these mechanics that keeps people playing and fatiguing from boredom. Putting in a rank/rewards system will only band-aid this problem.

I'm not sure if the characters are reworkable at this point. But an example solution is Pharah's shift ability jump is definitely reminiscent of tf2 soldier's rocket ability. Why not have both methods implemented? One which caters to a beginner while keeping the ""rocket jumping"" method for more seasoned players.

It seems Blizzard is pushing for this casual but sort of competitive fps which I think is GREAT, but doesn't feel they have hit the perfect balance just yet. Overwatch is definitely enjoyable and has run smoothly for me, but I understand people's opinion of feeling underwhelmed with the current BETA.

Also, its high noon.

The hype for overwatch seems to be dying fast.,"I'm prolly gonna get downvoted for this but what the heck time to drop some analysis.

Not only has twitch viewers dropped. The average number of players on the game seems to have gone down.

There are a couple of reasons for this I feel:

1. Unlike TF2 there isn't much room for the classic banter that you see in competitive shooters. Blizzard likes its game squeaky clean and noob friendly, but in all competitive games salt and drama is needed for prolonged interest.

2. Classes aren't balanced enough to the point where there's variation in matches. You will always see a specific composition that trumps almost all others. Also, tracer OP in the right hands.

3. Games are one dimensional. Objectives are too straightforward meaning there's no multiple paths to success. Mercy seems to be a requirement, bastion's OP in games where you're defending and in the right hands sniping classes absolutely rekt.

Its only used by stubborn players as an excuse to trash talk, or to not switch when their team is losing.

"[Theory] Moira, Androgyny, and Intersex Representation","**Chapter 1: Introduction.**

Forgive me if this is a little late to the presses, but it's something that only just recently came to mind. When Moira was first revealed, there was a reasonable amount of discussion in regards to her appearance, presentation, and even gender. To cut things short, [in an interview with Michael Chu](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/overwatch-moira-interview-lead-writer-michael-chu/), when asked if she was ""in any way queer in her sexuality or identity?"", he replied that **she ""identifies as female"", and felt that he'd prefer information on the topic to ""come out naturally as part of a story.""** With that, I'm not entertaining the notion of her being non-binary, but that still leaves a lot of things open.

---

**Chapter 2: Addressing the Pink, White, and Blue Elephant.**

First of all, in regards to her appearance, there's been some speculation that she might be a trans woman. There might be some outcry of 'why would Blizzard portray a trans woman as more masculine than some other characters', but while it's by no means determinative, being angular, tall, and deeper voiced is more par for the course for a trans woman than average. 

Before you jump to any conclusions, I'm a trans woman myself, and I'd honestly be happy that they made a character that's brilliant in her own right, without conforming to the insanely burdensome expectations that we're held to when it comes to how we look.

Conversely, if she isn't trans, that's also great! Despite being a 'villain', it's still brilliant Blizzard are taking steps to have women's body types be represented. Before I get deeper into the theorycrafting, **I think the most important thing to take away here is that it's wonderful that so many people are able to see themselves in characters where they haven't before.**

---

**Chapter 3: Down the Rabbit Hole.**

Buuuuut, the reason I'm making this post - there's a decent chance she's intersex. Why this conclusion, you might ask? Three reasons. Reason one is similar to why people might think she's trans. While intersex conditions are complex and varied, to the extent that some intersex individuals may live their entire life without knowing, many of them are also more likely to have androgynous appearances than the average population, whether that be due to atypical growth, puberty, or even simply being intersex making one more aware of societal expectations. It's by no means determininative, but it's an indicator.

Reason Two? While not anything concrete, the interview with Michael Chu discussing her identity, presentation, and how it factors into her character means it's not out of the question. This could simply be addressing her being a non-conforming cis woman and how that shaped her character and decisions, but it also means the door is open for other options. 

Reason 3?

**She has Heterochromia (her eyes are different colours).**

Now, like I first believed, it's reasonable to think that her Heterochromia is a result of her Genetic experiments, but I reckon it's the other way around: Having Heterochromia may well have been what compelled her to direct her genius into the field of genetics. After all, she was different, and rather than being put off, she wanted to find out why. **One of the causes of Heterochromia is something called Mosaicism** - which is where has two different genotypes, or sets of DNA. Drum roll please!

**Mosaicism is also a cause for certain intersex conditions!** - notably [XX/XY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46,XX/46,XY), [X0/XY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45,X/46,XY_mosaicism), or having [Ovotestes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovotestis). With Michael Chu's statement, Moira's appearance, presentation, and lifelong fascination with genetics (if her 'Foundation' spray is anything to go by), it's actually pretty reasonable to conclude that there's a chance she's intersex. 

**TL;DR -  Someone with heterochromia, (particularly with her physicality, fascination with genetics, and blizzard's track record when it comes to representation), is significantly more likely to be intersex than the general population. And! Even if she isn't intersex, trans, or the like, it's still wonderful to have an androgynous female character.**

---

**Chapter 4: This Isn't a Chapter, It's a Conclusion.**

Now I'm going to reiterate this again. Regardless if she's intersex, trans, or not, whatever, the main takeaway here is to emphasise just how important it is to so many women; whether they be androgynous, non-conforming, intersex, trans, or any combination thereof, to see a character like Moira. Even if she's a villain (and don't get me started on the queer-coded villain trope), she's always been portrayed as intelligent, competent, and resourceful, Most of all, I'm just glad she's in the game at all, because representing her body type at all is a step forward.

**Seeing a character you can see yourself in, where you've never seen that before, and then seeing them succeed in achieving their goals, or even just seeing them portrayed as being normal, when society's told you otherwise? It means a lot to people, and it can do a world of good.**",Overwatch,1555602417.0,t3_ben3oh

Mercy is a completely unfair character and our community is just as infuriating,"Just to start this saying, I’m a mercy play with 300 hours across multiple accounts all in gold 5 to gm2 so I think it’s fair to say I understand the state of this game. Mercy is not fair. She is a 200 health support who doesn’t require aim, can heal ~90hps in valk for 15 sec to anyone nearby with the most fluid movement in the game.  also provide 30% dmg boost and subsequently increase ult charged and reduced kill time. Her healing, movement and dmg boost are all extremely powerful. Then to top it off….. rez. She needs a full rework, either give dmg boost to another hero and make it more aim reliant likely on a cooldown or keep it on mercy and make it more aim reliant and give it a cool down. Rez should be significantly more punishing and I genuinely believe that you shouldn’t be able to heal them right out of rez, make it so when revived for the next 5 seconds their healing is reduced and every 1 second the penalty is reduced by 20%. Pocketing is a boring unfun playstyle us mercy have no choice but to play because realistically it’s so easy and brain dead there’s no reason not to. I hate her current position and wish the community would just accept our favourite angel is just too rewarding for how punishing she is.",Overwatch,1678659129.0,t3_11prjqj

Something like this could be good. That way it still has 2-2-2 but if you're doing really badly in a role, you can fall back to a different role if someone else also wants to swap. Make it be like a menu and require confirmation or something to swap roles, it autokills both players and forces up hero select where they have now swapped roles.",Overwatch,1567614489.0,t3_czn5xl

[Unpopular Opinion] I like the lootbox system and encourage them to make legendaries actually difficult to get,"EDIT: I'm on mobile at work so I can't change the flair. Also looks like the downvotes are pouring in. OK

Lets be honest, with the current way things are, there are no really rare skins. The only ones I can think of are Witch Mercy and any of the Summer Games skins since it's the oldest event at this point. I know I didn't play much at that time so I am always jealous of others who have those skins.

Why do we want Blizzard to make it so that we can collect every skin? Since when has that been an expectation? I come from a WoW background and rare loot due to timing and cost are something I really enjoy in a game. I like having a skin for my main that people can't get or can't afford, and in return I don't expect to have the coolest legendary skin for a hero I have 2 hours on. 

I, for one, encourage them to set a bar where it's not so easy to get everything. So that you have to pick and choose what you want instead of complaining that you need to spend $40 more because you HAVE to get EVERY skin/emote/spray/voiceline/icon.

The playerbase really likes golden guns because while they're not extremely rare, they do tell people how much you're willing to invest into a single hero. Why not the same with legendary skins? I remember saving up and being really excited to have a legendary skin at level 25 or so, early in the game. I wouldn't mind preserving that. ",Overwatch,1495825935.0,t3_6dj0xb

I believe Open Queue is better than Role Queue.,"Woah okay calm down dont shoot me. 

Honestly, when role queue came out I thought the exact opposite, but recently I have been part of a 3 stack queuing in open queue and it is the most fun we've had with Overwatch in a LONG time.

The ability to play ANY character you want. Counter the enemy team properly. Make a really unique team comp. For example, if we're lacking dps and healers are popping off we can switch out a healer for soldier - a small thing, but I feel like this is Overwatch is really how its meant to be played.

I feel like, on the whole, people understand that you cannot win with 5 dps, so you do tend to get better comps solo queuing too.  

Open queue is just *chefs kiss*

What do you guys do if you are a 1-trick that is getting heavily countered? I've seen many 1-trick players absolutely stomp lobbies until they get counterpicked and refuse to swap. Is it because you don't have confidence in your other heros or you believe you can still make the hero work against the counter?

Why Overwatch's 40$ upfront model was flawed and bad for the game in long term.,"Blizzard reported 1 billion USD gained from overwatch after a year. Lootboxes were a big part of it since everyone was new and they wanted shiny legendary skins.

But over the years throught the decisions made by the Overwatch team led by Jeff Kaplan and Geoff Goodman the playerbase declined. Also lootboxes were not generating too much revenue anymore since everyone had every skin they wanted plus 50 more. But for the servers to remain active and the game to constantly get updates they needed money. They obviously couldnt get too much from new players as there were barely any. No one wanted to buy Overwatch when they could just hop on to Valorant or Apex or Fortnite for free. Even if someone was intrigued by the concept of Overwatch none of their friends would be willing to play with them. Im sure a feeling most of us are familiar with. Even then if someone wanted to buy the game they could get it for 10$ since no one was buying and Blizzard gave a discount. On ebay you could get it for 5$ even though that was against TOS.

So a low amount of new players then how did they make money in the past 2 years? From my experience, smurfs. Smurfing has always been a problem in competitive games. It has always been there in first years of Overwatch too but the playerbase was very big so you wouldnt see many. But as the playerbase shrunk every game  had a smurf. It was impossible to play a game without a smurf in your game. Even in high GM lobbies half the players would be bronze border accounts. Smurfs caused a lot of the games to be unbalanced since the game was unable to determine their MMR properly. Also smurfs would hard grief games with no consequences since they were off voice and no one knew who they were. And they couldnt do anything because smurfs were their only source of income. 

The battlepass system we are given now is fairly easy to grind and for 10$ I would say it is worth. However the old skins we were able to get with grinding for 8 hours now being 20$ is a terrible decision that they need to adress now. But in the end as someone who cares more about the competitive side rather than cosmetics it doesnt really matter to me. If I dont get legendary skins but I get a constantly updated game I am happy with that.

Overwatch giving constant updates for 4 years for 40$ without having to pay a single dollar to get the skin you want was an anomaly that will never happen again. If you dont like it there is really nothing you can do as this is the industry standart. However the new heroes locked behind battlepass is something I dont really like as it seems predatory.",Overwatch,1665302607.0,t3_xzfzok

We really should have more pride flag player icons!,"It's super lame that the only pride player icon is just the basic rainbow, and it's not even CALLED ""pride"" it's called ""rainbow""

Overwatch has so far been inclusive of LGBTQ+ representation (albeit, only a little), including lesbian Tracer and gay Soldier: 76

While I always love seeing people's rainbow icons for their profiles, I know for sure that more LGBTQ+ members of the community would love to share their unique identities with individualized player icons.

Icons I'd like to see included are: Lesbian pride flag, Gay pride flag (different from rainbow), Bisexual pride flag, Trans pride flag, Nonbinary pride flag.

More would be better, but these major flags would help represent a lot more of the community. Also, a straight ally pride flag would be great for the visibility of LGBTQ+ allies.

The icons are already filtered by category, so what do you guys think of having a Pride category for all the pride flag icons? I think a lot of the Overwatch community would appreciate it.",Overwatch,1650571724.0,t3_u8wcxx

"If this game is all about hero comps and swapping, why are all the top players one-tricks?","That title is a bit jumbled but here is my point. Blizzard seems to think that the ranking system in Overwatch is fine. That 6 people can effectively get together, strategize and succeed. This game is all about hero synergy and switching to adapt to those moments. If this is how the game is supposed to work, and the ranking system reflects how effectively you do this, then how come “all” the Top 500 players and Grandmasters are all just one tricks?

The concept of “mains” in this game is conceptually flawed and bad one-tricks aside, how come I could do better at this game if I only played, say, Reinhardt? Sure, I’d get into situations where I’d lose do to comp, but I’d eventually get so good that I’d climb as high I could ever go, which would probably be pretty high, given enough time. This is garbage. The ranking system is bad and has been since Season 2. It has barely improved and not in any way that is meaningful and the analytics support it. The number of players who smurf because high levels are too hard, or because they can’t find a game is growing and those who do play only play one, maybe two characters and get stuck with players who do the same.

Us flex players are actually the worst in the game because most of us aren’t Top Tier with one hero, but we can play many. This means that the system is already rigged against us because even if we do climb, we will eventually reach a point where we aren’t good enough with any hero to beat the guy that hasn’t played anyone but the whole time he’s played the game. This, of course, doesn’t count the main issues of making a team hero shooter with the types of players who play this game.

Attack Symm is underated,"I play attack symm (I have at least 50 hours playing attack symm, 63% win rate, top 100 symm on overbuff depending on day) and always get asked why I play her or asked to switch. Attack symmetra is underated on attack and I just wanted to share some of my thoughts on why.

All KoTH maps are defence maps once the point is captured. As she is strong in defence, KoTH maps are perfect for a good symm. KoTH maps are also littered with akward shield gen spots that the enemy don't know about.

On 2 CP, her orbs can rip through a choke and a shield gen can really help with a push. A well placed/timed Tele can secure a capture point. 

Playload maps are definitely the most tricky, as the fight is constantly on the move. Payloads tend to stall the further a team is away from spawn, but a Tele can keep the momentum going. 

The enemy team will not be expecting an attack symm and this can catch the enemy team off guard. The locations of sneaky turrets and alt spots are less known so can easily throw the opponents.

Picking an attack symm can sometimes cause my  team to tilt before leaving the spawn. It's quite common for me to leave the spawn with an attack torb or someone that has only 20 minutes on widow. Please give the attack symm a chance! She has many benefits to an attacking team.",Overwatch,1497030508.0,t3_6ga0si

OW ranked system is the worst I've ever played.,"If you guys played few games with a ladder, you know it is true.

But I'm not gonna BabyRage or whatever, so I'm gonna explain my humble point of view on why I find this system bad.

1. It's the beginning, first season (so yeah, I assume this explain a lot), and ofc the ratings are a bit off the mark. I feel like a lot of players are between 50 - 60 but the skill levels are extremely variable. 

2. No league. How disapointed I was, as an ex SC2 player, to see that Blizzard chose to not implement a league system in OW ranked. For a player, having a goal of reaching an upper league is so motivating ! With the actual system, you just try to improve a random figure you have no idea what it really means. 

3. I'm not the first to talk about it, but seriously, what the fuck is wrong with the way point are lost and earned ?? This makes NO SENSE at all. Sometimes you win vs a +5 rating team, stomp them and you earn like 1/5 of a level. Blizzard really needs to be clear on how point are attributed and why cause at this point it's just a mess. 

4. Again, not the first to talk about it, but leavers are a problem as its never been for me. I'm at a point where I only play ranked with a 4-6 men stack so it reduces the risk of getting a leaver. I only played 20 games of solo mmr, I got 6 games where a guy left my team (sometime while we were winning) and 3 times a guy left the enemy team.  We're close to 50% of the games being completely irrelevant.

5. The players who are deconnecting cant rejoin a game, if I'm not mistaking. At least thats what a friend of my 6 men stack experienced. We were playing as 6, his connection dropped and when he came back (2 min later) He couldnt rejoin the game : He's losing mmr for leaving and we're doomed cause 5v6. Again, I really dont get it.

6. The coin flip system. I get what blizzard was trying to do here, but its unfair and we all feel like it. Sudden death are very fast, so why not play both sides on 1 point ? Then the faster on sudden death capture wins. 

Thats pretty much it, once more, its only my humble opinion, I'm not pretending to spread the truth around the world. I just feel like Blizzard tried something and failed, their other games ranked system is so damn good, hell why would they try to change it for OW ?

Multiple Heroes in one team.. good idea?,"Lets be honest, the Overwatch heroes have a great amount of individuality, complexion and theme which makes all of them very special. 

My main concern with this though is that surely people are going to find ways to use this hero selection and cheese it? It is a common mistake a lot of developers make, by underestimating the community and what it can come up with. Surely the game is going to be really really hard to balance if you can play multiple heroes at the same time ? It may be fun but I can see this dying out very very quickly as people will get very bored of the ""cheese"" strategies that WILL happen if something like this was to be a permanent feature in the game. I mean sure it would be fun for a couple of weeks but it would easily die out very quickly and all of these great heroes really wouldn't be very great any more as everyone would be playing them and copies of them. 

This is all my opinion but maybe having a cap of up to 2 of the same hero in a team would be a better thing if you really want to have multiple heroes ? It just seems like it would turn out really badly, it will be sad if it does turn out like that because personally I have been pumped for Overwatch since its announcement, and it would be such a shame if the game would just lose its fun and strategy if multiple copies of heroes can be played, making really unfair, cheesy and fairly unbalanced team comps. Which would force Blizzard into either nerfing the hero so it is nowhere near as good or leaving the players to combat ""cheese"" with ""cheese"" which really just isn't fun. 

I don't know what you guys think but I personally think it is a bit of a bad move. Maybe this could be a feature in a special mode but as for normal and competitive play I think its a bad move. 

Let me know your opinions guys it would be really interesting to hear other thoughts on this! :)

Symmetra is a support.,"Seriously. People complain that Symmetra is a defense hero and should be moved to that category. I disagree. Yes, she could fit into the defense category. This is because she supports her team in a defense style.

Being a support is not about healing. It is about increasing the effectiveness of allies. Symmetra's kit is about increasing the effectiveness of her allies. Not in the same way as the other supports but still. I’m going to divide her kit into 3 parts: her gun, normal abilities, and teleporter.

Gun. Her primary fire is the least supportive thing in her kit, it has support elements, but I will not try to defend it. Her secondary fire is a charged, slow moving, obvious orb that almost any enemy will simply walk around. On its own it is not expected to actually do much. The key thing about it is it can force enemies to move out of the way, herding them to places her team mates can take advantage of.

Normal abilities. There’s a reason she talks about balance, because she is all about tipping that balance. 25 shield might not be much, but how many times have you gotten killed and thought “if only I could have gotten one more shot off,” or “if only I had half a second more?” That little shield would have given you the moment you needed. Her turrets can be placed all over. A single turret is unlikely to kill anyone, but between its damage and slow it is likely to give a nearby teammate the edge they need to kill. That’s it really, a good Symmetra player can transform all 1v1s into a 1.1v1s.

Teleporter. This ability is pure support. It reduces the penalty of death for Symmetra’s team.

I want to also point out that almost all of the 4 hero categories have at least one hero that doesn’t quite fit. Attack heroes have great mobility, able to strike the enemy from odd angles. McCree’s only movement ability is his roll, which if judge purely as a movement ability would be considered the worst one in the game. Tanks shield their team from damage using their massive hit boxes and shields. Zarya is rather small for a tank, and her shield cannot cover the majority of her team. Supports have Symmetra. Defense is the only category that lacks at least one of these hero’s that don’t quite fit, the reason being defense is a rather broad role. These heroes that don’t quite fit are “off,” or “secondary” heroes. They can fill the role if it is needed, but really shine when used along side another hero of that role. McCree is an off-attack, Zarya is a off-tank, and Symmetra is an off-support.

Really I think the only reason that people complain about this is there is no “healer” tag (Label? Hint? What are those suppose to be called?) in the pregame menu. Snipers and builders get there own tag, but not healers. I should really make that it’s own post.

Sorry, I just needed to get that out.

tl;dr. Symmetra is a support, just not the same type of support as the others.",Overwatch,1468520937.0,t3_4susyz
Brig is Not OP Comp Culture is Just Dumb: An Essay,"Hey there, so there ya are enjoying some OW comp. You're tired of seeing Brig in every game. She's an easy character and everyone who plays her since her release is boosted garbage, you think. But is she really? Will you keep blaming the team and the game and ELO hell? Or will you take a moment to introspect and think about what you could be doing better to help your team, save your sanity, and keep slurping that sweet SR and working for that awesome gold gun? Well have I got a post for you.

So, I am a diamond flex so I can't speak for GM but I bet what I'm about to say is partly true at every level. So, I loved playing support and tank but also enjoy quite a few dps.I will confidently say I am actually my SR with basically every character except Widow, Sombra, Sym and Torb I play very aggressive and my greatest skill in this game is my game sense and positioning. My aim is passable, say what you want but this is why I loved Brig when she released as she is mainly a Tank/Support hybrid imo.
 

First I'd like to eliminate the notion that just because a character is new and/or requires less aim they are less valuable a player than others. Winston and Rein don't require that much aim but will anyone debate that a GM Winston doesn't deserve their rank vs a GM Widow? Furthermore yes Brig is a new hero and some people who played before her maybe didn't click with a character until her release. Just because a character is OG at launch doesn't mean anything vs new characters. Yes new characters change Meta and introduce new elements to the game that you may not like at first. But you don't have to roll over, accept it, and make rage posts to be removed /r/Overwatch. This post is about improvement and examining why Brig is considered OP despite her pretty obvious weaknesses.



So full disclosure first. Yes, I love Brig, gotten some great free SR off her when I have time to play. You may write me off as part of the problem but this would be a mistake. The problem with s10 is not with Brig or with Stuns or CC, it is with the solo que culture of OW comp. She needs to be focussed down to negate her impact and she punishes a lot of players who one trick ""meta"" heroes, aka every Tracer onetrick who never had to swap before. 



Now I know that statement will upset people but it's the truth. Most of the success I've had with Brig is playing against players who may have good aim but shit positioning and get punished because they walk into her range. And, more importantly, they don't have a hero wide enough hero pool to do anything differently, or so they think.



I'm sorry but onetricks are a problem no matter who it is, Sym or Rein or Zen or Tracer, meta doesn't matrer over flexibility especially when multiple Support/DPS one tricks (OT) can end up on the same team. Brig exposed this pretty common weakness of OW comp even more  heavily than we all already knew.  More Genji/Tracer OT flame me instead of just swapping Junk/Pharah/Hanzo/Widow to directly counter me. Brig hates range, use that. Bashing your head against her shield and dying over and over solves nothing and just makes this great game unfun for you, so why do that to yourself?



It still blows my mind that as I have climbed over the 2 years I've played this game how few people have the fundamentals to know to focus targets.  While it is ideal to have a mic or at least be in team comms, please take it upon yourself to pay attention to your teammates. Tanks can help to dictate the pace of the fight and if your dva is shooting the reaper, also shoot the reaper he will die way faster and make everyone's life easier, except his of course but who cares about the Red team? This is ESPECIALLY true for Brig. Brig is a support who needs to be focussed like any other support and yet people focus the slippery Moira who just fades away instead of the largely immobile Brig who after her CDs are gone is pretty fucked. Bait her to use her CDs and then beat her up. Her self heal cannot withstand much more than 2 people's damage in most scenarios and with the help of a handy Zen discord or Mercy damage boost she buckles even easier under assault. 

If her shield is up bust it too, she isn't Zarya it's ok to shoot her shield. Her shield is tiny and has the same health as Winston's bubble so it is very easy to pop. And once it's gone her most lamented ability, the shield bash, is off the table and she is even more free of a target. And with handy Junkrat or Pharah you don't even have to hit her directly, either burst her tissue paper shield down or hit next to her and the splash damage can do your work for you.

 

Do I think she could use some tuning? Sure everything could get better. I particularly like the changes to her ult, Rally because it was very boring to use before a fight which was the dominant strategy. Also Zen tank was crazy scary. But she is FAR from OP if more people just tried out more heroes. They're really fun trust me, Learning more characters will relieve a lot of frustration too outside of just Brig comps, instead of wishing your team had a Rein, YOU be the Rein, etc. Also I have spent a lot of time learning characters and learning their weaknesses, I have never had a problem fighting Brig or any other hero after a few matches because of what I learned by playing that character. 

TL:DR Brig is only ""OP"" because most players are dumb, stubborn, or inflexible, play more characters they're really fun and everyone will have a better time, ESPECIALLY you playing against her.

We really don't care about you not being able to handle the slightest of toxicity.

First of all, grow the fuck up. Overwatch isn't half as bad as literally any other online game I've played. CS:GO, DotA, LoL, any call of duty game. Hell, even when I was on console I played SoulCalibur 4 & 5 and I frequently got messages saying ""i hop u fuking die"".

Blizzard knows about the toxicity ""problem"". They've mentioned it. And if you really want to help them. How about actually providing ideas how they can improve it? Instead of just complaining? 

My point is, if you're gonna poison this sub with sob stories, could at least provide something fucking constructive? It's beyond obvious that reporting does absolutely nothing. The only way to get banned in this game is by being a streamer with 7k viewers and reporting those poor Sym mains and not saying ""heck you"". I've reported hundreds of players for throwing, being toxic, poor teamwork etc. I have NEVER received an email from Blizzard about anyone getting even a 24 hour suspension. 

There. That's my sob story. How do I end it? By proposing a fix! I suggest getting an automated system where if you get reports from 100 different people about the same issue in one season, you will be banned for the remainder of the season. If there's only 7 days or less left of the season, you will be banned for the remainder and half of the next season. If you get season-banned twice, you are IP-banned. You can't make new accounts without getting a whole new computer. If you believe you were unfairly banned (Like, if youre an infamous streamer like Kephrii or xQc people will report you just because they hold a personal grudge against you), contact blizz support. 

If you don't like it feel free to explain why. But like I said. If you're gonna poison this sub with sob stories and stale highlights, at least be good for something. ",Overwatch,1512302278.0,t3_7h9an9

The worst part is there has been ZERO acknowledgement from Blizzard that copy-pasting the balance changes to Mc and Wid was a bad move. If this is how the future of console-balance looks it will definitely hurt my experience.

Just a friendly reminder to people asking for heals from mercy,"A list of things Mercy's don't have:

Infinite hit points.
The ability to circumvent line of sight.

The chance to heal a flanker who is several hundred yards away.

The ability to glide through buildings or other solid terrain.

The HPS to keep you alive through 6 team ult's.

The combat prowess to one shot that Genji that keeps running past you all.

The ability to rez after that team wipe, when the Mercy was in the team wipe.

The ability to understand hundreds of different languages where the only recognisable word 
is ""Mercy"" (of course French causes issues most).

The ability to consistently snipe that Pharah you seem to be ignoring.

The chance to boost the dmg for your ult when everyone else is critical.

The ability to ult, when you have no ult.

And most importantly of all, confidence, when you bash them in voice comm's with your friends and tell them you are costing them the victory.

Things a Mercy does have:

Decent HPS on your tanks and front line damage dealers as well as top off healing for those passing by.

The ability to jump in a straight line to you and provide assistance as required.

Momentary invulnerability when they use an ult.

A sidearm to help pick off a harassing flanker with a bit of help

The chance to save a point defence or make that final push with a 5 man rez in a pinch situation.

And most importantly again, complete control over whether you live or die, because the other person who got told to pick support went Symmetra.

I did that thread because of tell tale edge shots. Which I see in this guy's gif. It'll be explained. 

I do this because shit was looking really fishy. [This clip ( 0.125 speed) by Arrrge set off my suspectometer.](https://gfycat.com/IdolizedBrilliantBallpython#?speed=0.125)

[Here's the full speed link.](https://gfycat.com/IdolizedBrilliantBallpython)


[Here's the image sheet for references to what I am saying.](https://i.sli.mg/s26Rzf.png)

Shot #1

The tell tale ear shot. As soon as the script finds the opening it fires. Immediately. Right at the edge of the head. This is one of the things I found in the other thread that was a sign of how the script is working. I will go into this especially in the shot against McCree.

He didn't use a sonic arrow to see if zen was going to peek, or anyone else while it's off cool down.

His reaction time to the soldier running into him seemed quite slow.

This is a video from his perspective, and the aim was pretty far off from the soldier's actual head.

He didn't use a straight horizontal line on the soldier either. It was **diagonal.** Doing that actually makes the shots harder and less consistent for real shots. 

What I'm saying is that he lacks the decision making / **form** that should go with these ""reflexes"". 
 

Shot #2 

A shot against ana. At the right edge of her head he lets loose. 

Odd velocity. The velocity should have been a near constant but it tends to speed up as he gets closer to the actual target. If you want to build good muscle memory you use certain mouse velocity for shots. 

The shot lets go after it reaches ana's right edge, the direction she is running in.

His mouse stays at head level with ana while he waits. As if he's still holding down a hotkey. When an elimination is granted I think it terminates the current action freeing up his mouse again. You can see this in the soldier shot.



Shot #3 - The damning shot that made me do this at all.

I thought to myself: Why would his mouse start jittering all over the place after he shoots? The answer was that there were two targets near each other and the script was confused. 

Imagine the hit box being a cube. The script is typically finding their edges. If you look at the shot on mccree it's like his aim is being pulled back left after accelerating to the right. Sticking onto the left edge of the cube @ gametime 4:23.

Now for the jerking. It goes from the left edge of mccree's hitbox to the right. This guy is still holding down his scripting key, so the aim JERKS in line with road hog's head.

Then his aim jerks **diagonally** to the left. It halts at horizon level lined up with road hog's head again.

He's stuck there for a little bit until the elimination terminates the script for that shot. Now his aim is unlocked. 

Shot #4

This shot wasn't scripted because his script looks for heads. To use scatter arrow you have to hit the ground in front of them just right. That's also why this is the worst shot of the clip [He didn't even hit the ground in front of the hog](http://i.imgur.com/xgz9nkR.gif)

Shot #5

Another shot aligned with the top edge of road hog's head on the top. You can see by the sharp red circles that indicates the projectile barley hit road hog in the head with the edge of it. 

This is also despite him running his aim straight into the center of hog's head. This is because of how the script works. 

Shot #6 - Jumping on road hog, more jerking. 

I thought this was odd because this guy's head was so big. But if you think about it all of the shots happen to the edges of the hit boxes. Now look here. He let's go at the edge of road hog's right hit box. 

This is one of the shots where you can't believe he got the head shot aiming like that. But if you consider how the script works it makes perfect sense. 

----------

NOTE: He's aiming into road hog's head. In the center. The script pulls him to the right to shoot at the edge of the hit box. This is how the script works. 

NOTE: I am able to always (despite the lack of constant frames on a gif) to find the suspect moments because the script does end up pausing a minute amount of time for the shot to go off accurately. 

NOTE: It's apparent that the script works in diagonal lines. 
	
NOTE: Aiming at zenyatta he was aiming at the right edge of his head. Then it swerves perfectly to the left edge as the right edge goes out of view. When the left edge is out of view his mouse slides freely. It goes in ~~line~~ edge with what I've been saying. 

Slow down the clips and see for yourselves. ",Overwatch,1471391622.0,t3_4y2ne9

Toxicity and Closed Beta,"I am not going to gripe that much but I feel like with the rise of users that have been invited into the beta, so has the salt levels. I understand that Overwatch is a fun and competitive game but I think people are forgetting why they are in the beta. It's incredibly overwhelming that the toxicity of League Of Legends has infiltrated Overwatch. I've reported a couple people but I doubt that will do anything, I think they should be removed from the beta after x amount of reports. 

What are your thoughts? What are you doing to stay positive during games? I hate muting the entire chat but I feel like that is starting to become the best option.

Did anyone want...?,"Did anyone want to get really good at the game and be among the top players? It can still happen I guess, but now people who got in already have much more time to learn and get into the game, and when you play, you are going to be already at a disadvantage. ;(",Overwatch,1446001362.0,t3_3qifqd
Mauga has ruined the game and the team balance,"Before Mauga was added, the game was still somewhat fun and balanced, but now that Mauga got in the picture, the balance of the game was just obliterated into a billion pieces. Every game always relies on whether or not your, or the enemy team has a Mauga or not, and if they have a good Mercy + Kiriko/Ana combo, having any chance in the games is literally out of the question if your own team even slightly underperforms. 
 
When the enemy mauga turns his Cardiac Overdrive on, and if the Mercy knows to pocket said Mauga, you can always forget about even thinking of having a chance in the game. Mauga on Mauga 1v1s are even worse than Orisa on Orisa plays, and you know how awful they already are. There's been so many instances where I play against a Mauga, and when I'm just about to get him down to like 150-200 health, and just on the verge of death, he uses Cardiac Overdrive, keeps shooting, and almost instantly gets all of his health back up.
 
Some of you might argue that Roadhog has a similar healing ability, but the thing with Road's Take a Breather is that he stops shooting in order to heal, so you still have the chance to get your own health back up, and/or use an Ana Nade to combat his healing and damage him, but with Mauga's CO, the whole premise is that he heals by doing damage, making it so that not only do you take damage the whole time he heals, but your damage is useless against him when he uses the ability. 
 
Mauga should stay FAR, FAR away from comp, and even if he gets added in he needs a HEAVY nerf, and I mean HEAVY. He should not have this amount of self heal, especially with how much base health he has along with the amount of damage he does. Adding him to the game has made so many games extremely unenjoyable. These rare Mauga-less games are now the only escape from it.",Overwatch,1702310609.0,t3_18fxvxf

To those who claim Doomfist is now overpowered:,"He's not. He was buffed to better perform how the average Doomfister plays him. You have PTSD from OW1 and need to sack up.

I'll give you some tips (from a DF main):

CC hard fucks him. Ana dart, Junkrat trap, Orisa spear, and Hog hook make us Doomfist players want to burn down an orphanage. He is easy to shut down.

He relies VERY heavily on heals from his team, despite the overhealth buff. If you can separate him from his band-aid source, you will melt him fast.

Good footwork will avoid his rocket punch. It's easy to miss, and in case you have forgotten, walls are a thing.

I watch a lot of Flats, and I have mad respect for him as a fellow tank main, but him and many others are wrong. Doom is not OP.

"Does anyone else feel like this game has really, really regressed?","I got this game in December of 2016, and started to have it take over my life after falling off the CoD bandwagon. I mained Roadhog, and really loved it. Then he gets nerfed... Which really soiled the character for me, but oh well. I start getting into Comp more and The OWL, and I really start to dislike dive. But thankfully, they introduced Doomfist. He was abit annoying with his Crowd Control, and I was pretty annoyed they allowed him to have a one hit kill, But no Roadhog. But I digress.

OWL starts, I'm having a lot of fun. Abit sick of dive, but hoped they'd nerf D. Va or buff characters like Roadhog, McCree, Soldier, etc. Then a new character is added.

Brigette.

A new healer which is cool, but she also has a lot of CC. Which isn't bad, because it does counter Dive hard, but I was a little worried she'd be abit much with her Stun, Flail, etc. But alright. She's added in, and alot of people hate her abilities, but I assumed aslong as they nerf her, it should be fine. The CC spam was getting abit much by this point, but I assumed this would surely be the last of it for a while....

And then Hammond.

And admittedly I'd gotten a little bored of OW and back into CoD when he was released, so I didn't get to play him much initially... But for the past 3 weeks, holy shit.

The game feels unplayable. I'm either getting melted by Brigitte's stun, McCree's stun, Doomfist's wall bash, and Hammond swinging around me. I feel like I'm going insane. Every game feels like a mess of that right now. Either that, or I go in and a Widow or Hanzo camping at a high ground and sniping me for hundreds of damage with no counter other than each other.

And to top it all off, Roadhog is **DEAD**. He is a liability on any team he is on, no doubt. And then they nerf him again so he has a worse damage fall off, so now D. Va has better shield  breaking ability then him? What the hell is Roadhog's role anymore?! It's already hard enough to get a hook on a character that can stun me if I get close, and now my hooks are breaking for now reason, and I can't even finish off a Zenyatta with a hook-melee combo?

Is there *anything* Blizzard can do to tone down the insane amount of CC in games and either add a counter to Widow / Hanzo, or nerf them? Am I the only one who feels like this game is so unfun now? 

And for the love of God. BUFF. ROADHOG'S. DAMAGE.

Tl;dr;

CC is anti-fun and has completely ruined the game right now. Also please nerf Widow / Hanzo (or buff their counters), and BUFF ROADHOG. ",Overwatch,1535701799.0,t3_9broe4
Open Letter to the OWL regarding Code of Conduct,"#In light of recent events I'd like to call some attention to the OWL Code of conduct, breaches of the Code of Conduct (CoC from here onwards) and problems I have with league.


#1 The CoC is not clear.
 There is no clear TL;DR for the overwatch CoC nor the OWL. Nor is there a clear way to find the CoC for either, as i can say after spending a good 30mins rooting around trying to find an official page stating exactly what is acceptable and what isn't. When searching for a OWL CoC all i could find was the rules of play that in no way showed how players should act.(https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/eo/EOC4AITZTVME1519148239333.pdf  http://d2y4mhrku00tr3.cloudfront.net/Overwatch+League+Terms+of+Use+enUS+enGB+ANZ+LATAM.pdf). This page says nothing in regards to actions or use of words in or outside of League. What I, as a viewer and player, would like is a clear CoC that is clear and openly available to anyone for any reason. A tab on the OWL website and/or Overwatch website would be greatly appreciated.


#2 Punishments are not consistent.

~Jan 19: xQc was suspended and fined for the first time after a supposedly ""homophobic"" joke regarding Muma on his personal stream (I'd like to mention at this point I am a member of the LGBT community and thought the joke was completely fine and I thought it was funny). He apologised and Muma seemed to have accepted it. He then donated to a LGBT charity to apologise. This was cause for a $2000 fine and a four match suspension.

~Jan 24: Profit flipped off the entire OWL, live on stage. This was a public event. He made an apology publicly. $1000 fine, no suspension.

~Feb 21: Jonathon ""reinforce"" Larsson made a tweet at 19:38 effectively calling Fragie and Taimou retards. This was the news regarding him on that day: https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/news/21536209/making-their-moves ; There was no apology I could find and nor was there a consequence.

~Mar 9: 
-Taimou was ""accidently toxic"" on his stream, calling a player a ""Faggot kid"" and was fined $1000, no suspension.
-TaiRong posted an ""offensive meme"" and received a warning.
-Silkthread was fined $1000 for account sharing.
-xQc was fined $4000 and suspended for using the TriHard emote in the OWL stream chat. This emote is often used with the number 7 after it to show a small salute to the players as a way of saying hi. This has been around on twitch for a long time and has never been perceived as racist; the only reason it is now being perceived as racist is because it happened to have been used while (i apologise, I cannot remember his name) the presenter, who is black, was on screen. This was merely poor timing and clearly not racist. The suspension was also linked to him referring to other tank players as retarded but as we saw in regards to Reinforce, this apparently isn't an issue if you're talking about their playstyle as xQc was.

This links back to the lack of clear CoC as it seems Blizzard is lacking context to situations or in some cases, don't really seem to care. We would like the OWL to show it's viewership some transparency and let us know what is happening during the decision making process because, as I said, I love the league and really want it to succeed but this wall between Blizzard and the viewer is just making me so angry at blizzard. It's starting to get to the point where I don't want to watch OWL because of the negative links it now has.


#3 The OWL stats are lacking.
On screen we are shown so much cool information be we aren't allowed to see it for ourselves. I want to be able to analyse the leagues and decide who i think is best and I think others would like that too. I don't want to have to dig through on screen pop ups to see if Birdring has more overall point time than Fleta (random example), I want to have a massive spreadsheet that I can just look at and analyse. As far as I'm concerned, I'd be  happy with an Exel spreadsheet with numbers just plopped in at the end of a match. To be able to properly compare stats and see who's best at each map would greatly help my play because I'd know what and who to watch because while I love OWL, I don't have time to watch every map and every Strat.


#TL;DR 
#1 Blizzard, give us a clear Code of Conduct for OWL and Overwatch as a whole that can be found on their respective web, clearly marked at the top of the page.
#2 Make punishments more consistent. Either suspend Profit and Taimou or don't suspend xQc. Casters should face similar punishments as players because they are equally important in the role of OWL. 
Please pay attention to context and players actions after the fact.
#3 Please give us the OWL player stats in an open place for so we don't have to try and work everything out from pop ups.

Final point: Overwatch is amazing and I love league, keep up the good work and I appreciate any and all feed back.

Update 1: tried to make a post about this on the Overwatch general forums but got silenced for a breach of Code of conduct.... Funny that.

How to get 8+ Lootboxes for the event.," This is a method that i have used for the longest time, and may as well pass the knowledge along for anyone who doesn’t know.

This is mainly for people who don’t want to buy lootboxes right at the start, but still want some quick boxes.

Okay, so:

&#x200B;

1: you get a free lootbox at the start of the event, this happens whenever you log into the game during the event, nothing new here.

2: Before the event, make sure to play up until you are just about to level up, that way, once the event starts, you can either just do the new gamemode, or a QP match for a quick level up, equaling a free lootbox.

3: by the time you have done all this, you’ll be about 1/3rd or maybe even half through another level, so just quickly round that off in QP or Arcade, for a 6th box

4: there will most likely be sub gamemodes that also hold a lootbox drop, such as any heroes or different difficulties.

5: with the addition of EVERY gamemode coming back, you may be able to get 2 lootboxes each day, one for the main gamemode, and one for the sub gamemode

6: Always team up. Click stay as group every time a game ends if your not in a group. Get that 20% bonus.

7: win 2 arcade games before the event drops, so you only have to win 1 more game for a free lootbox

that’s 8+ lootboxes, in about 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Hope this helps.",Overwatch,1539077225.0,t3_9mno8d
"The toxicity in this game, no matter the mode, just makes this game almost unplayable","Being a pretty much support only player, I always thought being targeted and chased all game is just something that comes with the role. Kill the support and the rest drop like flies, normal, right?

The last week or so I picked up dps for fun. Been playing exclusively qp with that (Usually I'm more of a ranked unless friends ask to play qp type).The amount of people targeting me specifically was unbearable. Every other game. Just yesterday, there was like 4 Dooms ignoring everyone but me, a Sigma using every ult he had on me solo, and just about every other dps trying to ego battle me, with all of them sh*ttalking me in end chat. Half these games I could physically not play because I was literally bullied. And no, this is not me feeling bullied, this is teammates pointing out that I am being targeted too.
(Quick edit for clarification: not bullied as in I keep getting picked off or diffed, but rather as in them going out of their way to ego battle, chase and kill, ignoring everyone else while even letting their team lose)

I can't even imagine how terrible it has to be for tanks then.
And I have noticed similar behavior on friends before while playing support and trying to help them.

Like why? Seriously why? Why can't we just all have fun in a game, at least in quick play? Why do we need to bully people to the point they physically cannot play? This is such common behavior. Do y'all want this game to die by driving everyone away through toxicity?

(And don't come at me with the clicheé ""can't handle some toxicity? don't play."". I play some of the most toxic games on the market, League, CoD, the list goes on. Nowadays, these are more fun than Overwatch.)

This really needs to stop. The monetization isn't the only reason this game is dying AGAIN, not everything is Blizzards fault, as much as I hate their practices too. The behaviour of the players plays a huge role aswell.

This is more of a rant than anything, I just wanted to get this out. Though I would love some genuine discussion about this if someone feels like it.

How do people have fun playing anything but support nowadays?,"Feels like healing and power have creeped so much for supports.

When I play support I feel like a god because I have broken abilities, high survivability and nobody cares if I do bad, but if so good everyone endorses me.

The mercy nerf is actually just stupid and an embarrassment from the balance team,"I genuinely could not believe what I was reading when the mercy ""rework"" came out

Why is she constantly avoiding meaningful nerfs while other characters suffer because of her --

If Mercy enabled her to be cancerous why did they change every part of her kit EXCEPT the damage boost ??

Her kit literally falls apart because of the guardian angel nerfs -
1) She's unable to keep up the beam connection without line of sight because GA shared the same cool down with 
it 

2) She's unable to revive teammates and reposition immediately, she's forced to sit in a spot for almost a whole second ?? like what ??

3) most of her movement techs are clunky or straight up gone 


Mercy is unable to fight back like the other supports literally the only thing that keeps her alive is her movement, and can someone please give me insight into why that is getting nerfed , while her buff was 5 more ammo , apart from the katrina memes it literally did nothing

Really blizz? This is your excuse? You really think that FOV plays such a heavy role that your going to limit all PC PLAYERS and make us game like CONSOLE PLAYERS? Your going to make us stick with a terrible FOV setting, which isn't even considered standard in today's PC games?

"Please don't auto-set Player Profile to Private, Blizzard","I understand some people get grief over people looking at their Player Profiles. And for those people, it appears Blizzard is implementing a solution.

However, Player Profiles can be used as a great tool by conscientious players to build a team around.

If I can take a quick look at someone who appears to be a one-trick in comp, but isn't on mic, then the team who is on mics can discuss how to play around that as we're taking the time prior to the match to adjust.

As well, no matter what heroes appear on a  play list it can be used to decide maybe the best role or the best team strategy to come up with.

At the very least I'm suggesting that the option still remain, but to make the default setting as public as it currently is. Make players TAKE AN ACTION to set it to private or friends only, and not have to take an action to make it public. I think the default for the community should be public so that we can use that  information to build an effective team and to only use the private option if you really are being the victim of harassment.

This is especially true in the console world, where there is no text chat option and probably a higher percentage of players are not on mic.",Overwatch,1528458504.0,t3_8pj8dy

"Okay seriously, can we quit with all the ""patch X has RUINED Overwatch"" posts?","Yes I get it, you don't like some change they made and you want to voice your opinion. That's all well and good, but the game isn't ruined by far. When Jeff said the Overwatch team was afraid to post, this is why.

Not so long ago, we all jumped on the anti-hate bandwagon, but as soon as the next unpopular change was made, we all revolted again! What happened?? We all know there's a problem with toxicity in this game, and I believe this is where it starts. If you're not happy about something, don't freak out and curse off the hard working *people* at Blizzard, just be patient.

With only one exception (scattershot), Blizzard has never failed to address balance issues in a timely manner. We've seen it over and over again: Widow's bodyshot damage, Roadhog's hook, Bastion's overhaul, Doomfist's punch. Each time these came into the spotlight, there were people who cried out that ""Overwatch is dead!""

But did it die? No! We're up to 35 million players now! If we really want to improve ourselves as a community, we need to stop with the pitchfork riots and start trusting that Blizzard will make the right changes. That's not to say we shouldn't voice our opinions, because we should, but we need to learn to be more respectful when doing so.

I will admit that I'm a Mercy main, but that doesn't mean I blindly approve of the buffs she's gotten. I had some very civil, very productive conversations with DPS mains about how to balance her yesterday.

"Hot Drops have a major flaw, making some deals overpriced compared to previous bundles.","Looking at some of the deals its seems like respawn made a sweeping price point per item making some bundles more expensive before the discount and even some after the discount.

Each item is priced at what each item rarity is supposedly worth (An epic item is 1000, a legendary is 1800, etc.) So a 2 item legendary bundle would orginally cost 3600 coins even if in previous bundles with the same items it was worth somewhere closer to 2250. Some of these discounts make the bundles still more expensive than the orginal bundle price, mostly with the epic rarity bundles and a few of the legendary ones.

A Love Letter to the Ranked Random,"Dear stinky poots (not actual username, but a fun play on it),

It was *interesting* to watch you push a fight all on your own against a full team an entire POI away from where we landed, having only grabbed a single weapon and some ammo off of drop. It was exciting to work with our third to get your banner and res you! It’s too bad our third died for the sake of rezzing you too, but we eventually got him back 😊

I was surprised to see (jk, it didn’t surprise me one bit) that you decided to push yet another fight on your own - and into zone, no less! - with naught but your now two weapons and white shield.

There are a million angles for you to get sniped from outside forcing everyone inside which can reasonably only fit 3 teams max. There are limited escape routes in tight quarters where someone is probably waiting to one shot you. And if you do make it back outside your teammates are probably deathboxes in the center of the pylon about to watch you get knuckle clustered, vantage ult-ed, or swung on by a lucky pathfinder who didn’t know you were there - he just likes grappling because it’s fun and also has a PK.

spitfire: i wouldnt realy say this gun is underrated cause people are starting to relize this gun buff actually is good and its underrated because theres is basically no recoil and your can fry people easily but its not like it used to be when spitfires was a nightmare in season 8 and 9

Apex Legends FPS Drops,"So here is basically my problem. If you know a possible fix, thank you in advance:

I have bought a new PC approximately 6 months ago. Apex was one of the first games I downloaded and played ever since.

Up until 1 month ago there was no big problem I was playing with good fps and having month. However, within the last month, I have this problem:  
1- My fps is down by 10  
2- When I first open the game, I have severe stuttering/fps drops at a point it is impossible to play. After a while it seems it passed for a short time but then, it is unplayable again. During this ""drop"" phase I generally see various of red warning signs on the right side of the screen.

My system specs: HM Omen Gaming Laptop 16  
Processor: intel i7-13700HX  
RAM: 16 gb  
OS: Windows 11 Home 23H2  
SSD: 1TB (Half is empty)  
GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU (Integrated)  
Display: 240Hz with 1440p

In other games (Finals and CS2) there is no problem of this sort. So, I am lost. FYI, the fixes I tried so far:  
Changed the nvidia control panel settings to only use the Nvidia GPU and changed some 3D settings to increase the performance (I changed them back to default)  
Tried every different in game setting in Apex  
My drivers are updated  
I set background apps off  
I changed to directx12 Apex settings but it did not seem to solve the problem.  
I have deleted OmenGamingHub and LightStudio (some 3rd party apps of HP) because they were using so much of RAM.  
I have played with LogitechGHub closed because I saw somewhere that it lowers the performance however, it did not work for me.  
I deleted and downloaded the game.  
I verified the game files through steam (Before and after reinstalling the game)

If you know anything that I can try, please say so as I don't have any more ideas to try (or why this problem is happening). Thank you all.",apexlegends,1706003793.0,t3_19dkzfs

\- Uninstalled/Reinstalled the game

\- Verified integrity of game files

\- Set priority to High in launch options

\- Disabled ingame overlay from GeForce Experience

\- When that didn't work, uninstalled GeForce Experience entirely

\- Lowered Mouse Polling Rate from 1000 to 500

\- Lowered all graphical settings to absolute lowest

\- Disabled V-Sync Ingame, enabled in NVIDIA Control Panel

\- G-Sync is enabled

\- Used DirectX12 launch options, no change in performance

\- Checked ""Disable fullscreen optimizations"" under Properties --> Compatibility in the gamefile

Crypto buff pls,"Hello! I have an idea to make Crypto a stronger pick for the 14 of us that main him.
Nothing crazy just a little something.

A new addition where once hack is deployed, player can hold their ability button(or something like that) to toggle 'modes' on hack.

Now, you've got the basic 'send it to hit a wall and it faces outward,' basically a sentry, so this would be 'sentry mode.' Where it's basically that, hack sits somewhere and scans outward.

Next is 'hover mode,' which makes hack fly above crypto, making it easier to be shot, but scanning any enemies within 15 or so metres, of course this would be limited by buildings, which is why it's only useful for specific scenarios. (If that's too good, maybe make a limit on how long it stays in the mode before returning to sentry mode)

Finally, is 'patrol mode.' This would do something along the lines of making hack move side to side within a set distance, say 50 metres, just slowly patrolling back and forth, or something like that.

I'm not much of a creative mind but I definitely think something like this would help crypto a good bit.",apexlegends,1705975662.0,t3_19dd9m3

Lobby Glitch,"Here recently, I have ran into a problem when playing with my friends on Xbox (I’m also on Xbox). When we party up in game, it shows a random character (which they don’t have equipped) and says they’re level 1 even though they are really level 300+. Because of this, it won’t let us play ranked and if I try to restart my game and log back in, it gives me an error message for 30+ minutes before letting me back in the game again. Is there anyway to fix this? I’ve never had this problem until about a month ago. Thank you for the help.",apexlegends,1705961438.0,t3_19d7z0n

Why does a fully depleted Purple/Level 3 Evo Shield still count as being better than a full Blue/Level 2 Evo Shield?,"There was a Blue one on the floor and my Purple one became depleted in a fight so I swapped to the Blue but in my haste I pressed the button twice so I just picked the Purple back up. It shouldn't do that as at that point the Purple is worse than the Blue.

Make it so the game also factors in how much shields Evo/Body Shields have as well as their level. Or make it like it is with attachments, where if you have a better one equipped you have to use the Alternate Interact button to pick it up. 

Shields that are higher level and have more shields: Interact

Shields that are lower level and have more shields: Interact

Shields that are higher level but have less shields: Alternate Interact

I believe it works like that in Deathboxes where it won't let take Shields with less shields than yours? But this is designed so you still can pick them up off the ground if you want them because say, you have Shield Battery/Phoenix Kit and could restore all the shields.",apexlegends,1705952817.0,t3_19d4fg9

"Apex Legends super stuttery/laggy, no clue what the problem is","I can't seem to figure out this laggy/stuttering situation on my new 2023 ASUS Zephyrus M16.

It's running:

\-Intel i9 13th gen -RTX 4080 -48GB RAM DDR5 -1TB SSD -Using KTC H27S17 165hz gaming monitor

All settings are maxed out. Even if I lower the settings the stutter continues. All drivers updated (windows, Nvidia, Intel integrated, any peripheral apps, etc). I've tried deleting the graphics setting profiles etc (C:\\Users\\zeta0\\Saved Games\\Respawn\\Apex\\local). I've tried limiting the amount of apps running on theGPU and setting the rest to the integrated GPU. It happens when settings are either Silent, Performance and Turbo mode.

This isn't really happening on other games I've test (The Finals, Witcher 3, Counterstrike 2, etc).

CPU and GPU temps are normal during gameplay. CPU around 80c, and GPU 68c. Doesn't appear to be bottlenecking/throttling. FPS is consistantly 100-120.

I get random lags and stutter which is obviously annoying. I dont know what it is. Is it hardware or software, configuration, or something else issue.

Any guidance or input would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks Reddit community!

Caustic Discussion,"How does everyone feel about caustic as of late? I am a long time caustic main but I do understand the reasoning behind his previous nerfs.

There is one thing I never understood, a long time ago, caustic and Bangalore were affected by a density bug that made their gas/smoke much easier to see through. Bangalore's smokes were fixed, but caustic gas was not, as the devs liked the gas being thinner.

Having thicker gas would be a really nice buff right now, for what I would argue is the weakest controller legend. I do think he's just one small push away from being in a good spot personally, but I'd love to hear what non-caustic players think of him right now.",apexlegends,1705927608.0,t3_19cuv4t

Killcam. I don't understand why I am bad," I will begin by sharing my experience before delving into the discussion about the killcam at the end of this post. I consider myself an average FPS player – not a pro, but certainly not a novice. With over 700 hours invested in Apex and an equal amount in Overwatch, where I achieved a platinum rank, I've also played extensively in other FPS games like PUBG and COD. Equipped with mid/high-tier hardware, I use a mouse and keyboard setup with a consistently strong internet connection. Apex has always stood out to me due to its mechanics, and I've been playing it since Season 1.

However, my relationship with Apex has taken an unexpected turn. In my earlier days, I would acknowledge my mistakes, aiming to improve my gameplay – a process often driven by unfamiliarity with weapons, game situations, and a need for enhanced aiming skills. The introduction of crossplay, though, brought about a new layer of frustration during matches. There were instances where I would shoot at an unsuspecting or distracted target from behind, landing nearly every shot, only for them to swiftly turn around and eliminate me within seconds.

Not every encounter resulted in frustration; there were times when I knowingly engaged in melee combat, accepting the imminent defeat. However, it's in those instances where I anticipate having an advantage that I am left bewildered as the outcome swiftly turns into a defeat.  In contrast, games like Overwatch rarely presented such challenges – when I sensed an advantage, I seldom lost a fight. So to better understand these perplexing situations in Apex, I started spectating the players who killed me. Strangely, I often found their aim to be inferior to mine. 

Recently, with the introduction of **killcams**, I hoped to gain insight into what went wrong. Unfortunately, watching these killcams only intensified my confusion. The reliability of these killcams remains uncertain, as I frequently encounter replays where my assailant misses more shots than I do, or situations where their aim falters at the beginning, the suddenly get better and execute a series of perfect shots with peculiar and unlinear movements.

In conclusion, despite my extensive gameplay hours, a clear understanding of my skills, and the ability to distinguish between novices and pro players, I consistently find myself in situations where I struggle to comprehend why I was outmatched, especially now with the added perspective from killcams. I'm curious if others in the community share this sense of bewilderment during their gameplay.",apexlegends,1705924038.0,t3_19ctu2v

My experience with players on Apex,"The two experiences I had with players on VC were direct opposites. First seemed to be a kid and honestly was super cool and nice, I didn’t talk to him but he was helping out the third person in our trio and was encouraging them on, was just a nice experience esp for a noob like me. This was one of my first games and I’m a people-pleaser so I was super stressed about messing up, but it was super chill. We actually made it pretty far too. 

So after that I left my mic on… well, until I met the second person with a mic-

The second was this dude who asked if we had mics and I said yes- and then immediately started complaining and trash talking. It was almost funny. We literally landed and I moved away slightly to grab some loot and he immediately started swearing up and down about how stupid I was and how he “always gets people who don’t wanna do teamwork” (ironic considering he wasn’t being a very nice team member) like whatever happened to “hello”. Then we got ambushed and died and ofc he starts trying to antagonize me, telling me it was my fault and taking down to me. Like “oh so how did your little solo adventure go for you” like if you don’t stfu boy I was two feet away from you. Bro literally thought he was some sort of military commander, like you’re playing fake war games in ur moms basement it’s not that deep honestly. I said one word and suddenly it’s beat Bobby flay level of cooking (except bro did not cook bro left the stove off and beat everyone else with a pan)

So I just left cuz I ain’t putting up with that sh*t. No more mic for me. Can’t say I’m really surprised though. But tbh I’ve come across way less toxic/annoying people than on most other games. 

All in all, most people seem to be pretty good at teamwork and that makes me glad, because I think it’s just a lot more fun playing with a team than on your own. Only really had one dude who just completely abandoned our squad and left us for dead. 
It’s good when there’s at least one player who knows what they are doing (not me) so I can just follow them around. 

I still dread being the jump master, though. It sucks. I always relinquish it but twice it ended up coming back to me. I never have any idea where to land and then the other people start suggesting places and I’m like… bro why didn’t you just make us land there in the first place. 

I think the team mechanics are implemented quite nicely and you really don’t need a mic or anything to communicate effectively. Which I think most games lack. It just makes it so much easier to have a good time. I feel like most game’s basically force you to use a mic or else everyone in the team hates you. Also, I like the little “thanks” option- makes me feel like a pure hearted soul.

Probably will never happen at this point but wanted to share my take on Kuben Blisk coming to apex as a legend.,"Blisk: The Original Predator

Passive: Apex Agression - as Blisk deals damage he builds up agression (as seen above your weapon hud). The more agression he has the faster he moves. Decays overtime

Tactical: Jump kit dash - briefly activate your pilot jump kit to dash in the direction you are moving. If you slide at the end you can keep your momentum. This ability has three charges that has a short delay between each one.

Ultimate: Survival of the Best - target a low health enemy in close range and dash towards them, knocking them prone and attempt to execute them, instantly killing them and bypassing the downed state. If an enemy damages you in this state the execution will be canceled but the target will be left in the downed state.

""Its simple. You kill me? You're better. I kill you? I'm better."" - Champion intro line and possible select line.

""I guess we know who's better."" - Kill line

""Oi, don't feel to bad. Not every day a legend faces a myth."" - Kill line",apexlegends,1705900808.0,t3_19co5r6
How to 'See' better in Apex,"I have a friend who plays, and I watch him share his screen relatively often when I am eating. Among the things he needs to learn to get better, one of the biggest things just seems to be that he doesn't see enemies very well. If an enemy is anywhere at all on my screen, I have a 99.999% chance of seeing them, sort of like how you expect eyes to work. But my friend seems to only be able to notice about 75% of enemies on his screen. If they are not 100% super mega easy and obvious to see, there's a decent chance he misses them completely, and then will turn his back to look at something else and then die to being shot in the back. I know this post will mainly get troll replies or no replies, but if there is any advice anyone has about what to tell him or how to train your eyes to see enemies better, I would love to hear them. He has gotten better at many aspects of the game, but I am at a loss as to how to teach him to notice enemies better. And until he does, he will always be stuck with the phrase ""WHERE DID HE COME FROM?!?"" on his lips.",apexlegends,1705897128.0,t3_19cn13l

Apex Legends Character Concept: Fracture,"Name: Fracture. 
Role: Assault.  
  
PASSIVE: Last Chance: When you’re downed, you can use your custom semi-auto pistol to damage enemies. Any kill or down will automatically revive you with 30 hp.   
  
TACTICAL: Rewind: Place a Teleportation pad that you can teleport back to at any time. Max distance of 40 meters. (25 second cooldown).
  
ULTIMATE: Pain Cycle: After a 6 second charge, you will deal 85 damage to all enemies within a 35 meter radius, at the cost of downing yourself. Any downs or kills made with the ultimate will not trigger the passive. If you don’t damage anyone with the ultimate, you won’t be downed. (2:15 minute cooldown).  
  
ADDITIONAL INFO:  
   
PASSIVE: -The pistol you use has similar stats to a P2020. 
  
-you can switch between using your knockdown shield and your pistol. You can’t.  use both at the same time.    
  
-click your tactical button while downed to switch between the knockdown shield and the pistol.  
  
-to prevent the passive being used recklessly, the enemy who downed you will be immune to the pistol for 3 seconds.   
  
TACTICAL: -You click your tactical button to place the Teleportation pad. You click it again while the pad is placed to teleport to the pads location.  
  
- The tactical is similar to vantages tactical. If your tactical is off cooldown and is in range, it will be colored blue. If it’s on cooldown, it’ll be orange. If it’s out of range, it will be red.  
  
- you can recall the pad at any time.  
  
ULTIMATE: -If you miss your ultimate, and no enemies are damaged, you won’t be downed, and 25 percent of your ultimate will be refunded.  
  
- during the 6 second charge time, enemies will be notified that they are in the ultimates range.  
  
-Your teammates will be slowed down by the ultimate, instead of damaged.",apexlegends,1705889377.0,t3_19ckjjc

And now they want to impliment line of sight to the traps? In my eyes thats with the throwing nerf the worst neft they coud have done. The thing that makes the traps so good is that they are not only traps but also indicators when enemies are close, now we have to see how thats working out.

Thanks to Conduit I am happy to return to Apex. Conduit is missing piece of a puzzle this game needed.,"I always found difficult to play Apex Legends because of the sweats and match making. No matter how much I practice in terms of work-life-hobby balance (NOT playing each day 18 hours), I mostly end up being dead in 1-2 minutes of gameplay or being loot goblin for 10 minutes and then dying instantly making someone happy with all the loot I had.

Instead of improving aim and movement (requires a lot of time that I can't afford to waste because of job, family, hobbies) I always wanted to be a better support player. Active healer, or active teleporter to safety or something.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, many support legends still required offensive gameplay. Lifeline? Yeah you can heal... If your teammate and you survived the sweats. Revive? Try to defend lol. Loba? Well... What's the point in looting if you die after that quickly.

&#x200B;

But with Conduit... I like this one! I actually can HELP during a fight. I can heal shields quickly and give needed support. Even middle skilled player can have a chance against sweat with additional shields.

And oh boy, having those shields through the walls and with this distance... I think Conduit is a healthy addition to the game that was starting to die out for casual players because of the sweats (I play the game more than 3 years and I can say that 2-3 years ago I was not obliterated THAT quickly like nowadays).",apexlegends,1705853897.0,t3_19c6x0t

Allowing to position the ult more usefully without having to position YOURSELF to get the desired result.

( The two large gates leading to the old prowler den on Storm Point is a perfect example - you need to move down and stand in front of the gates to get the ult to go across them both, with the added tweak you could do the same thing whilst standing against the fence )",apexlegends,1705852383.0,t3_19c6cbp

enjoy the game.,"so... this may be clutter or redundant, but i just wanted to say:
please try and enjoy the game; there is no need to get bogged down in the hate or constant accusations of cheaters. the game is good----movement is unmatched. dont think when you die, ""oh, he was cheating."" but instead think, ""oh, i shouldv've done x or y better.""

sure ea sucks and they can do better, but focusing on others is always the wrong way... because it is mostly out of your control. sure post glitches or additions you think would make the game better, but hate only brews more hate. 

Apex is the best BR out there and, again, the movement is unmatched. and if it does not grant you the fun or result you want then find other games....

i really do not know purpose of this post other than i am disappointed in gaming culture and communities in general and there is so much negativity in every gaming subreddit/community.

be the change you want; actualize the vision you percieve the gamestate should be.

anyways... goodluck and have fun.

I actually love team deathmatch and love this map, but I think it is bugged.  Every time this map is on rotation I get excited (or used to), but it doesn't ever actually connect.  I just sit while it makes the connect sound and says connecting, then goes back to matchmaking repeatedly.

Things that I think would improve the game,"1. Matchmaking. This one is talked a lot about so I wouldn't elaborate too much.
2. Cosmetics unlockable by completing challenges. If all Respawn/EA cares about is engagement they could implement this system as it could give us players a further goal and a reason to actually keep playing the game. This could, if implemented effectively result in more people playing the game thus boosting the player count.
3. A new playlist which rotates between past LTMs. Due to an increased player count Respawn could implement a new playlist without affecting already existing playlists too much. This could give the people who want to play a specific LTM they missed out on an opportunity to experience it. In addition the playlist could be the place all future LTMs override removing the possibility of any complaints from a takeover event.

Attachments going straight to secondary weapon,"I don't know if I have a weird bug or something, but figured I'd ask here. 
If I have a setup like a 301/45 or a Flatline/CAR, whenever I pick up an attachment it goes straight to the second weapon, even if they're stowed and unstowing would pull out the primary weapon. If I have the Flatline in the first slot and it's ready to be unstowed, picking up a mag or a sight goes straight to the CAR. I've checked the settings multiple times, uninstall and reinstalled multiple times and can't figure it out for the life of me.

Buster sword should change your game strategy,"If you drop in a poi next to a poi with a buster sword, don’t venture off to that poi alone.  
Also be prepared to die in close combat. 
The sword is so op, it completely changes confrontations.   
Even though I prefer shooting people and detest the sword, I’m going for it on drop out of pure necessity. 
In doing so, I’m wiping the first enemy confrontation like 90% of the time.  Especially if the other squad has dropped in the same poi. 
If my team doesn’t get the “Thing”,  you have to take into account the melee reach is more than twice the distance of a punch and the lurch is way faster. 
Gotta really push your movement skills to put some space between you and the op sword.  This may sound like obvious advice, but remember that when they put up the sword shield, they take absolutely no damage. 
So fire a short burst to get them to put up the shield, then either use that moment to get some high ground or more distance or time their shield drop when firing. 
Other than Revs alt, there is no other time when it’s smart to do this, and Rev is actually taking damage.  Thus, the completely different game strategy for Apex. 

My advice to Respawn if they ever introduce this sword in a LTM again is to fully charge everyone’s ultimate on drop.",apexlegends,1705773183.0,t3_19bhfya

Question from a returning player,"When apex first came out, i played it constantly. At the time I was on console & I was pretty good, winning a fair chunk of games, getting high kills etc

nearly 5 years on I've returned to the game but on PC with KB&M, thought I'd give ranked a try and got placed Rookie 4/0 LP, which is fine, I think I deserved that

I am solo q only and I'm wondering if these observations continue in the higher ranks or is this something I'll have to live with as a solo q'r

\- SO many octane & revenant players who want to hot drop, take every single fight even when ill prepared & when they die after trying to 1v3/1v6 they spam ping and blame you/the team

\- Playing as conduit, no one seems to take advantage of the shield boost

\- No one comms

\- Should I be playing conduit in solo q at this rank?

\- What other meta legends should I try to learn? (tried a tiny bit of Catalyst)

\- Assuming wingman x peacekeeper combo isn't meta anymore, I've been using mostly havoc & nemesis

\- does the LP you earn change based on rank, for example. Lets say I have a 5 kill win and I get 350LP in silver, when I get to diamond, will those same stats offer me less LP?

low 99% FPS in game sometimes,"I recently got a new computer and in most games, it runs completely fine with high fps and 99% fps however in apex the fps is at 260 - 300 while the 99% fps is around 150 - 200 (still high but is really inconsistent which makes the game feel bad). it also frequently drops to like 20 or 30. If anyone has any fixes i'd really appreciate it.

My Take On How To Better Apex,"Ranked: bring back how s13 worked during split 1but keep promotion matches. also please remove heat shields from ranked similar to algs  


LTMs: please instead of takeovers just make it a separate mode. when i want to play with my friends who are new i want to teach them apex not an LTM  


* Conduit: make the tactical heal using her shield health or make it so it can only heal 50 shields
* Bangalore: nothing. her most appealing factor imo is that smokes counteract aim assist 
* Bloodhound: Please have blood ult give constant scans like it used to if the scans are 1second full body.
* Horizon: Shorter tactical duration and/or weaker pull on ult. p.s please fix her audio
* Valkyrie: Make her a controller. just my take but she doesn't need care package scans where her ult is a evac tower
* Seer: Give back fast heartbeat scans and increase range to 60 meters at least. for tactical, the scans should be 5 seconds. for ult, let the throw range be 25-30 meters and give back diamond scans for moving enemies and add footprints for crouching enemies.
* Loba: MAKE HER TACTICAL CONSISTANT PLEASEEE
* Catalyst: make her ult blind/slow for less time

Everyone knows leaving early is bad in Apex but it is horrendous in OCE servers, I've had so many people that will leave while they're still alive because our other teammate has left or gone down (while I'm still alive as well). There isn't enough of a penalty for leaving early. I report all of them but because it's unranked I doubt it matters. There should at least be a 3 minute cool down timer, and it grows with each early leave the person does per day.

Apex Legends Character Concept:,"Pls don’t be rude or hateful to me or anyone in the comments. I enjoy reading feedback as long as it’s appropriate and respectful. Ty :D!  
  
Name: Overdrive. 
Role: Skirmisher. 
  
PASSIVE: Hard-wired: Reload your weapons and move faster for 6 seconds after your shield is broken.  
  
TACTICAL: Dash: Move 15 meters very quickly in any direction. (20 second cooldown).  
  
ULTIMATE: Dash Tunnel: Create a 45 meter long Tunnel in any direction that anyone can use. You can open and close the tunnel’s entrance at any time. Lasts for 30 seconds.  
(90 second cooldown).  
  
ADDITIONAL INFO:  
  
PASSIVE: - The passive won’t activate again until the previous 6 second timer is over. Meaning if you get your shield cracked twice in 6 seconds, the time won’t restart.  
  
-The passive lets you reload your guns and move 20% faster.  
  
TACTICAL: - The dash will break any doors that are in its way.   
  
- The Dash has a 1.5 second charge time before it activates.  
  
- The dash is NOT like a wraith phase. You can still be damaged while dashing, however you’d be really hard to track.  
  
- It takes roughly 1.5 seconds to reach the full 15 meters.  
   
- Like wraiths “Into the void” ability, you can’t use weapons for a short period of time after exiting the dash.   
  
- The Tactical goes the direction your moving. For example, if you’re moving backward, the dash will take you fifteen meters backwards. If your not moving, or moving forward, you go forward. If your moving to the side, you’ll go to the side.  
  
-when moving forward, the tactical will go where you are looking. So if you’re looking up, you’ll go fifteen meters up. If you’re looking down, you’ll go fifteen meters down, etc.  
  
ULTIMATE: - The ultimate would be roughly as fast as an ash ult. However you can move back and forth.   
  
- Closing the tunnel entrance will kick anyone in it out instantly.   
  
- You can’t close the Tunnel when you are using it.  
  
- you get an audio cue when an enemy is using your Tunnel.  
  
- Like the Tactical, the Tunnel can go in any direction, depending on where you’re moving and looking.

What are some tricks you fall for when an enemy is playing your main?,"I'll start off with myself as an example. I'm a Rampart main, and I always like locking building downs and waiting for enemies to kick down doors. They never expect me to pull out Shiela and this always guarantee me 1-2 knocks per door. If they somehow made it inside (e.g., grenade spam before entry), I'd normally have 1 amped cover in the back of the room for me to fall back to and make my last stand.

Yet, I still fall for other Ramparts (normally ones that are low) who rush into a building, block the door, and Shiela me down. There are hardly any Rampart players in pubs (besides the current event) that I don't have the reflexes to not kick down doors when other Ramparts are behind it.

Apex Crashing at Loading Screen - PC,"So, I've been having an issue with Apex and its driving me insane. I can't find any answers online so I've put a request in on the EA support page and am wondering if anyone else has any ideas while I wait for support.

When launching the game through Steam, the game will crash without a  bug report when in the launch menu. I've attached a video of the issue. It seems to  crash as soon as I click ""Ignite"".

I have done the following:

re-installed GPU driver 2x & restarted computer

re-installed Apex Legends through Steam and restarted the computer

launched Apex Legends as ""administrator""

restarted the computer multiple times

Ping System > Mic,"You dont need mics to communicate effectively.

Your call outs take longer to process than a visual indicator, and are prone to misguidance . I.e. statements like ""they are low"", ""one shot"", ""they are here"", ""they are there"". It only serves to confuse.

In high stress situations why would you want people talking over the already almost non existent footsteps? Or even worse talking AND pinging (often spam pinging). You cant hear or see anything as teammates spam ping multiple enemy locations. 

And if you are going to use your mic. Make sure people can hear you well. Dont get mad because none of us can hear your call outs over the game. And no matter of raising your voice in stressful situations actually makes anyone try harder or somehow aim better. 

I say this because my best games have come from quiet games. No one is speaking. Pings are precise and not spammed. And my team is using all the types of pings to communicate.

How to fix Vantage,"Vantage is a ""suvivalist sniper"" in the recon class that is barely picked across all game modes, ranks, and skill levels. She also has a 0% pick rate at a pro level. Overall, I think her kit is great and she is fun to play, but it's clear she needs some kind of buff or change to make her more viable. 

I would keep both her passive and tactical the same. The passive fits the recon class and is quite underrated in providing useful information through the Spotter's Lens. I would also keep her tactical echo location the same as it fits the sniper roll allowing her to reposition during fights. It is also quite balanced because she is has an absolute chonker hit box and the ability is slow to use - not like the instant-getaway mobility that skirmisher like horizon brings. 

IMO, the real issue with Vantage is her ultimate, sniper's mark. For starters, she is a mobile recon agent, so why give her a damage-dealing ultimate? The damage is very lackluster unless you hit multiple shots which are capped at 6. It's also so weak when guns like the 3030 are in the game that do more damage, are faster, and have more than 6 bullets.  The damage bonus mechanic is lackluster and rarely capitalized off of. The sniper in its current state also teeters between being weak and insanely OP. If they increased the damage per bullet or increased the multiplier duration, it could result in a really OP sniper or a really oppressive mechanic. Overall, it's just a bad design and needs to be changed. 

My suggestion to fix her Ultimate would be to remove/reduce the damage portion of the sniper and make it primarily a recon ability. If you tag someone with the sniper, it highlights the enemy to your entire team - similar to maggie's ability Warlord's Ire that highlights enemies she damages. If hit by the dart, the player can remove it by holding interact over 1-5 seconds, similar to removing a Cypher dart in Valorant. This not only makes the ability more in line with her recon class and role, it makes her more team-oriented and creates an interesting and similar dynamic to that of choosing to heal vs. fight as it would force players to stop and remove the dart, or keep it on risking that you are fully highlighted. It also rewards skill and accuracy and isn't just a press-a-button free wall hack ability like Seer/BH. I would also suggest they increase the handling and hip fire of the sniper greatly. I picture a super fast auto-rifle recon dart gun instead of a slow single-bolt sniper. You should be able to quickly tag, swap, and capitalize.

What do you think?

TLDR: Vantage is bad. Change her sniper ultimate to a recon dart that highlights the enemy for the whole team. Dart can be removed by holding a button like Cypher from Valorant. Buff the sniper's handling, speed, and hipfire. Decrease the damage or remove it entirely. Make Vantage an actual recon sniper that provides utility to the team.",apexlegends,1705699863.0,t3_19aucpb

Is the content of Youtuber LewiTrotter legit?,"I am quite new to Apex and was looking for some content to see how people approach fights etc.

I have stumbled onto this youtube channel by a guy named LewiTrotter. He is a pred player, mostly doing challenges for his channel (win with every legend within 24h, 20 bomb with every gun etc.). In the beginning I was amazed how he racks up those kills and gets to these fights.

However, after seeing other people's content and my own fights, I have started to wonder whether LewiTrotter is getting legit players of his caliber or just really low ranked players. 

Why am I saying this:

* In some instances the opponents simply don't shoot him or push him when he is low
* He seems to be able to use his Horizon Q to heal up fully, often right above the opponent's heads. If I did that, they'd beam me back to Valorant.
* During his challenge using all the legends, he doesn't seem to use the legend's ability well or at all. Is his gun fighting ability that good that he could basically play CS in Apex with no issue?

I lack the game knowledge to tell whether his lobbies are legit - other people seem to notice that too judging by his YT comments.

Seer needs to be Reworked but not Reborn,"I know I'm going to be crucified for this as most people hate Seer and want to keep him 6 feet under but hey, I think it might be better to toss the idea out there. I personally think Seer needs to start with a clean slate but not reborn. I love his legend fantasy of being the person who sees all but I think he's super overloaded with what his abilities do and would heavily benefit from being a little simplified. Here's how I would personally change him and this is from someone who loves to play Seer and love his ability to give great information, but hate how they keep hitting him back and forth like this making him unplayable when solo queuing and just worse than BloodHound when with a squad, albeit very deserved as he was actively making the game worse when he was strong.

Goal: Make him a much more information based legend. Make his scan the primary focus and make his tactical not do 1000 things all at once as it's the reason why he just can't be balanced. Nerf his passive without making it completely useless and buff his ultimate into being somewhat less situational.

HeartSeeker: Make him have to genuinely dedicate to his passive. Keep the beat rate thing that tells you if someoneis low on health. Give it a secondary indicator that tells you if there are multiple people with low health(ie. Two out of sync heartbeats, cap of 3). his passive while he has a gun out. Keep the passive's current accuracy(maybe even lower it) but make its range match his tactical. Make it much quieter. Remove the indicator that shows how close an enemy is(varying levels of how orange his ring is). Bring back his ability to sprint while using it. 

Focus of Attention: Make his tactical faster as it is way too easy for anyone with even 1/4 of a braincell to dodge it. Keep the silence but lower its duration to 5 seconds. Give it a pulsing scan that acts as a ping (Scan would stay stationary because having constant information is busted) every 2.5 seconds(2 scans). Keep the threat vision with line of sight as it should be good at countering smoke. And of course, remove the slow function that it has as its just unnecessary and overkill, same with the revealing of health and shields.

Exhibit: Keep his ultimate basically the same but give it the same pulse scan that I gave the tactical at a lower frequently due to its long duration, maybe once every 5 seconds. I actually like where his ultimate is at although it is rather weak in most place on the maps and would like a clearer indication of where everyone is, especially when in a more open area. When people shoot, you tend to already know where they are so I think it just needs a little pick-me-up.

This is just what I came up with for how I'd like to see him changed in the future but what would you guys personally do with him because I like seeing what other people would do to fix such a poorly designed and handled legend.

What are they trying to do with ranked? (Old predator player),"I played Apex religiously when it came out and I stopped playing around season 5 after I finished with a predator rank and got busy with life. I've come back now and ranked seems so unfun.

Why is Apex so focused on forcing people to go for placements, rather than playing the game? I understand the need to reward placements, but it feels like it's placements or nothing at this point. If I get 10 kills a game I shouldn't be able to still lose my rank, It just seems crazy to me. Back when the game first came out the biggest complaint I saw was about rats in ranked, but now it seems like that's the only way to play. ",apexlegends,1705670757.0,t3_19aj1dn

So we all hate Gun Run right? ... Not me!,"So I used to be in total agreement with the consensus that Gun Run was a crap game mode. But, thanks to the current Final Fantasy event thingy going who really *is* crap (lol) I've play a lot more often mixtape.

And wouldn't you believe... I've started to dig Gun Run. Not just accept it, but DIG it.

See, there's something about being FORCED To use a specific setup that has a strange appeal to me now. It's like the game is saying, ""This is it, make the best out of it, and get a kill or be stuck with it forever.""   
And when the gun switch and I look down at my hands it's either ""oh crap!"" or ""hell yeah!"" and both of those reactions are followed by an equal ""BRING IT OOOON"".   


I tell ya guys, this mode aint that bad. It's about mindset, imo. Take the mode for what it is, the challenge is in handling the various guns properly, and it'll only make you a better player at the end of it.

Nevermind your stats after the round, just enjoy the challenge for what it is.

Loba passive rework idea,"I don't play Loba usually so I didn't realize how inconsequential her passive is. I guess it could help you in the first few minutes after landing but loses almost all value later on in the game.
Maybe instead of seeing purple and gold stuff through walls, purple stuff she equips has the same boosts as gold items do? Her purple mags reload themselves, her purple helmet makes her abilities load faster etc etc.

I need the community to settle this!,"On storm point, playing as a 3 man squad, im the jump master and we drop hot at Echo HQ. A round or two before this I dropped within the HQ where the majority of the loot is and where they just removed the zip to the roof while the other two guys in my squad landed at the bins just outside where their is loot along and between the steps. I had died because I wasn’t close enough to them so I said alright next time if you guys want to drop outside HQ I will too. So back to - I’m jumpmaster, I go for HQ but land at the bins just outside, one of my teammates breaks off so he’s landing at the bin on one side of the steps and I’m landing at the bin on the other side of steps. My third teammate rides me all the way down never breaking loose, lands on the same pile and bin, then we both proceed forward under the overhang and I grab something and he shrieks “”BRO YOU ARE RAKING MY LOOT MAN I RAN AWAY SO YOU COULD LOOT” mind you this is literally the next closest pile and pretty much the most logical path to loot down otherwise I’d have landed somewhere else. I told him it’s ridiculous to stay with jumpmaster all the way to the ground and land on same pile and run the same direction and call that your loot, I said you are literally taking whatever loot is on that path and reducing the amount available to both of us, if you want to call it your loot then break off of me and land close enough to get in the same fights but far enough that we aren’t grabbing at the same loot bins and piles.

"KD 1.25, average damage 500. started Apex in S19 but can't promote from Bronze.","I got hooked on this game with Apexmobile and started Apex for PC from S19!
Unlike mobile, there are no bots in the ranks which I find very exciting and enjoyable.
When I first started, I was unfamiliar with PAD operation as it was my first time, but after practicing for a considerable amount of time every day, I am now able to actually perform the moves that I have in my head.

However, the rank system is very severe and it is very difficult to be promoted.
Of course, there are difficulties because I have been playing solo for a long time because I don't have anyone I know on the PC version, but I keep the VC on all the time. However, 90% of the people don't wear VC. But I still keep talking on VC lol.

Here is my question.
I have been stuck in the bronze zone for about a week now, but when I look at the orbits, sometimes there are players in master or diamond orbits.
I usually don't win those matches.

I don't enjoy gaining points while hiding, so I basically do kill moves for fishermen and priority moves to secure the inside of the ring.

I am sure that is the key to improving my play skills as well.

Do you have any advice for me?
I thought I could at least aim for platinum, but anyway, the PC version of Apex is too difficult...

Time for solos to be added.,"I believe it’s time to add solos to this game for good, playing in duos or trios and your whole squad leaves when they are knocked or not even landing with you happens more than 50% of the time. It’s so hard to keep a mental playing this game when you can’t even enjoy playing. Why haven’t we added solos, I don’t care about one legend being OP versus others, it’s the same in duos/trios. You pretty much run into the same characters so what would it matter. Seems like respawn cares more about pick rate and all of that rather than their player base enjoying the game.

Deathbox Looting bug,"Me and Buddy have noticed over the last few days that looting deathboxes has sometimes been buggy, taking anything from a deathbox instantly closes the menu (we still get the item) and we have to reopen it again. Anything that requires a hold action is completely out of reach unless we removed the item it would be swapped for from our own inventory first. 

This hasn’t affected the majority of our games but when it does it starts about halfway through a match and ruins the flow of looting mid fight and often has screwed us over because of it.

How do you play Apex in 2024 without good aim?,"I used to play the game casually a few years ago, decided to get back into it because the gunplay seems fun but I’ve gone through well over 200 matches now and haven’t even gotten close to a win, the closest i’ve gotten was fourth squad alive.

Every other player is impossibly fast and I can’t even comprehend what I’m looking at, let alone aim and fire. The game just doesn’t really feel fun to play for me anymore if I stand no chance against players at even the “lowest” levels. After all, it doesn’t matter what my positioning is if I can’t land more than one shot before the enemy turns into a mosquito. My only luck so far is hitting someone with so much damage at once that they aren’t able to react themselves before I can shoot again and down them, but that’s only possible with a select few relatively rare guns.",apexlegends,1705591734.0,t3_199sp87
Hoping a dev can see this: massive crypto bug,"Unsure if this was posted already, but I feel like we should spread the word for these new crypto bugs which cost me the game.

1. Crypto drone can't open large doors anymore.Only regular doors. There's even the tooltip saying I can open the large doors, but spamming it nothing happens, which leads me to believe this is a real bug. I'm talking about the huge cargo doors like at command center on storm point, as well as the ones that slide up like at harvester on WE.

2. Crypto drone can't steal an already active respawn beacon. Arguably, this could have been an exploit they wanted to get rid of, but I really wish it was still in the game. I used to do this all the time and abuse the fact there's no loading bar for crypto when he is respawning his allies, but an enemy team was respawning their teammate at the respawn beacon, and I couldn't use the beacon. Extremely frustrating as it ended up being a 1v3 because I couldn't drop my teammates back in, and they got both their teammates back in.

3(not a big deal), but it seems like with certain crypto skins, his sword loads in like under him by 6 feet when dropping and the gun drags on the floor. I’m sure this is just where the image of the weapon is, cuz I can still headglitch, so I really think it’s just the coordinates the frames are assigned to, but the actual bullets and gun/gameplay are fine.",apexlegends,1705591528.0,t3_199smen

In mixtape you can truly see the immense skill difference between players. Is movement for PC players that much better?,"I've been playing more mixtape modes lately and the incredible movement I've seen from some players in there is just on a different level. (I guess because there is no SBMM in there)

People bunnyhop around and lightning speed and have this weird jittery movement that makes them very hard to hit. Though at the same time, they hit other easily while bouncing around like that. They are also in the air half the time and the results are the same there: hard to hit, they hit every shot. 

They also switch weapons back and forth like they are playing Doom Eternal, constantly rotating between two guns after each shot. I've never seen anything like it. 

I guess these are PC players? I consider myself pretty decent on console with a controller, but those movements seem impossible to perform for me.

"So, the new player experience...","Hello everyone. I started playing Apex Legends on PC a few weeks ago so I could party up with my buddy, but things have been rough so far. My aim is terrible and my movement in gunfights is probably equally terrible and I'm struggling to improve. For context, I used to play Planetside 2 a few years ago and I racked up killstreaks in that game like a demon, but none of that experience seems to translate here. I can barely manage a single kill in a match and it's extremely disheartening.

My account is currently sitting at level 6. The last few matches left me feeling guilty about dragging my team down due to my inexperience, which made me not want to queue up again. I heard that dropping near enemy teams can force you to get better at aiming but I haven't tried that yet.

tl;Dr New player. I'd like to get better at the game, but my last couple of matches have been almost as unfun and frustrating as my first games in Dota2 like 10 years ago. Any advice is appreciated.",apexlegends,1705581592.0,t3_199p98x

"So like, is there something I can make an effort to do to try to get some actual experience in this game ?","I say that cuz like, I'm bad at firefights, but it kind of feels a little difficult to get better at them when they're over the moment they happen. 

This game feels like it has some really weird pacing that feels overall detrimental to anyone trying to get better vs people who are already better. 

Cuz either you start the match and spend like half an hour looting in peace to get really good gear so you feel ready for a fight, only for your entire squad to get wiped the moment you get into a fight despite your gear. 

Or you drop right into a hotspot with literally nothing and get slammed due to that. 

And I've found there's really no in-betweens. 

Like, I wouldn't say I'm bad at shooter games, cuz in any other I do perfectly fine. 

It just feels like the whole Battle Royale setup to this game makes the pacing between fights really awkward. 

And because the fight is just over the moment you die, you have to go through a whole match-making wait all over again to get into another fight which you'll likely die to and yeah this is just a whole thing. 

I've tried playing Bangalore, Caustic, Pathfinder, Ash, anyone I can think of that could possibly give me some sort of tool to help give me and my squad an advantage in fights, but it always feels like the enemy just knows exactly where we're at and any advantages I gain are just undermined because the enemy completely ignores them. 

Even Bloodhound doesn't help me because yeah I get information but it's very fleeting and I just die when the enemy approaches anyway. 

I don't really know what to do here. 

Should I try to find some random veteran to play with to babysit me or just play Mixtape or somethin ?

I literally JUST beat TSM's pro team 3 stack in Ranked to get to masters...im ecstatic right now...,"I literally CAN NOT fucking believe it bro...my friends aren't gonna believe it either 😂... 

So I had failed my masters trials like 50+ times already, to the point where I had 10 attempts to get it, and failed still so I had to gain 50 rp to try again...so i did that, right?... 

I hop on, and immediately invite my duo who were also on... 

Me and one bud were both doing our promos to masters, he had 9 attempts and I had 10...

After 9 CLOSE ASS games (every single one ended in top 5, and a few were top 3) my bro got mad and said fuck this it's 3am, I'm getting off...ok koo...so I have one more try...why not just solo queue right? I'm probably going to fail and try tomorrow, might as well just do it and start fresh the next day... 

So I queue up, find a game, and guess who the champions are? TSM ImperialHal, TSM EvanVerhulst, and some other TSM guy who's full name I didn't catch... 

I immediately said ""welp, so much for winning this one..."", and the wave of defeat started washing over me before the game even started...but I just went with it...

My teammates were good 😁 FINALLY! Me and the Bangalore I got were roughly the same skill level, but the horizon on our team was just fucking CRACKED! 

Long story short we just followed the horizon and supported him 😊 I played conduit and kept everyone in fighting shape, we killed a couple teams on the way to top 5, and in the final end zone we had an insane height advantage... 

The circle closed all the way, we hopped off the roof, and finished up the last 2 squads (who were already kinda weak) for the W 😃😃😃... 

Im so fucking hype that my phone died while writing this and I lost it all, but I literally HAD to share this so I typed it all again 😂... 

Lucky (the horizons name), if you somehow see this, please confirm this story in the comments because I know no one is going to believe this shit 😭 and thank you bro! You are the fucking goat! Already told you that like 10x, but just gotta say it again! 🤣 Your name is very fitting because I would've never imagined I would beat TSM to get to masters rank...WHILE SOLO QUEUING...im still just in shock...

Edit: Also played a few lottery tickets for obvious reasons...(not joking 😂)...

Edit 2: Really this post is just to say, if you're having trouble with promos, and you're really fucking close to the rank you want, don't give up on yourself! YOU CAN DO IT!

Lol like I said it took me 50+ tries until I got lucky, so if you already put in the time and you want to rank up in the hardest season, just bang your head against the wall doing promos over and over and I promise eventually you'll get it...

It's torture tbh...getting so many 2nd and 3rd place games just to fail the promos...but once you get it, it's a high that makes every second worth it...

"How Apex Legends could be, better.","There’s a lot on my mind about the game and where it’s going. FPS or shooter games generally. My friends were the ones who got me into this game as good friends would do. I’ve been paying attention to this game not only playing it, but always viewing YouTube content and watching the pros play in tourneys and scrims. I recently joined Reddit. I’m not the best player in the game but I have a certain game knowledge by always devouring the info I see, going from trios to ranked usually getting platinum then to diamond. The characters I play are anybody really. I like Blood, Path, Gibby, Valk the most. The meta has been changing on and off since the characters keep getting newer and others more useful in different game modes. I remember when ranked had no shields and we had to find a white shield ourselves. I know this game has been under fire about the money they try and make and the way they handle the cheaters like most competitive game have been. Please make sure that you guys give me some feedback on why or why not my options and opinions matter to you if interested.

1. Dropping with a P2020 or mozam. (Ranked and competitive) enhance the loot rng

2. Dropping with a grey backpack. (Ranked and competitive) easier to loot up

3. Rank point system should be a loss in full points only if you die 20th. Getting a kill or placing 19th and above should be less of a point loss. Not just when you get 14th or 10th. Ranking points from tenth and so on should result in better points but not as much as getting the win. 2nd and 3rd points shouldn’t be close to a win.

4. Take off the demotion tries and negative point loss. Why lose half of your points and have to get tries before you demote. Just take away the amount we lost and derank normally.

5. The nerfing of some characters like wraiths ability to phase is slow. Makes her less viable and not balanced. Her animation needs a fast pace like ult. Path is the only one to get a cooldown and ult when looking at a care package. Rev is played as a skirmisher but was assault before. All those things make the game feel more of a choose to win then a play what you like. Seer is played way less often. Certain characters like conduits shield heal doesn’t prioritize who is weak but closest and is slow to do so on herself. Ballistic can’t cancel his ability. Mirage’s clone only walks but if he could go on zips or do other things it would make characters more interesting. Path would be cool if he could heal on his zip. Just weird suggestions really to make gameplay more fun. All these things are difficult to implement so I know it can’t always be that way.

6. Heat shields are two stack, should be one/Doesn’t have speed revive. Not in comp scene..one is all you need. 

7. Updates and bugs are still in the game. Everyone should have a job that takes care of those things accordingly and if you can’t fix ‘em tell the community why or when.

8. You can only rank with friends who are close rank to you. If this is for boosting factors I guess it makes sense.

9. Bronze and below should be matched up in the same lobbies. Silver and gold. Platinum and diamond.

10. Masters and preds need more incentive or reward. They need their own tier list even or add an extra high rank to have a challenging experience.

11. Skydive trails aren’t saved only banner icons. Why is that?

12. Trials was okay but having 1000 points just to get to the next level is not rewarding. Point system is. The higher the rank, the more points should have to be earned. Season splits or no season splits. Make it to where we can like to play it forever without changes. Then change it if gets stale. At least in my opinion.

With all that being said, it’s not enough. And the devs or whoever prolly won’t read this. Or listen to the actual people. Keep copy pasting gun nerfs and stick to event scheduling but atleast they could hire some people to buckle down on the cheaters.",apexlegends,1705525723.0,t3_1997tcz

I am tired of the MRB in Control,"Thee has been a lot of times where, the match is not bad, but also not good, and then this items drops, and on that point onwards, both teams are focused on getting the Mobile respawn beacon, and there are two outcomes when that happens:

1- The enemy team gets it and places it down on your spawn (Zones A or C), but they cant do anything

2- The enemy team gets it and places it down on your spawn (Zones A or C), and they domminate your whole team

I really don't like the thing about the MRB (Mobile respawn beacon) being on Control, i have enough stress when the bonus appears, so i think they should remove it, at least for me i don't think it belongs in Control

Nostalgia is gatekeeping your enjoyment,"A lot of people complain about the game, but the most common thing I've seen everyone mention is that ""it used to be better"" or the ""back in my day this and that"". It is probably true that maybe people who played in the early days dont like the vibe of the game anymore, but the game itself is in a much much MUCH better state than it ever was back in the early days.

I started playing again after a year long hiatus, since then SO MUCH has changed and for the BETTER. New maps, new modes, new legends, new QoL changes and my most favourite, CHANGING THE FIRING RANGE ITS SO GOOD NOW. This was a lot better than it was a year ago and im much more hyped to play again.

The game is in a really good spot for new players to come and enjoy and the people from like season 0 or the early days aren't complaining about the game being different but rather yall just miss the good times you had during that time. And thats whats stopping yall from enjoying it now. (We can all agree that old time apex was way more buggier than now)

So don't discourage the new players coming in because trust me, this is the best time to play with a lot of new content and even the event, i know its controversial, but they will be able experience a super cool ltm.

What nerfs have made you the saltiest? For me it’s removing Lifeline’s shield then adding Newcastle.

Another nerf I’m kind of salty about was removing Wraith’s Naruto run. Just like Lifeline’s shield they could have adjusted it but they removed it instead and now she only Naruto run in phase, when she’s immune to damage anyway.

I’m also kind of salty about Bangalore’s smoke being nerfed to stay for… 18 seconds instead of 23. Because it did nothing and she needs more nerfs. Why is she still able to deploy 2 smokes at a time? It’s actually so stupid.

Fan Creates Rework Ideas Pt. 2,"
Wraith - 
Wraith is one of the heaviest hitters in the Game's all-time meta but has a lack of use in the current meta outside of her insane repositioning ability. This insane repositioning gave Wraith a reputation before being nerfed to hell, so creating a new way to play Wraith would be ever so monumental to the game's state. Her new Ultimate would be grounded and give her a competitive edge, but a weakness. The ultimate I thought of is a dome of portals, she'll be thrown around a mess of portals, depending on the range of the dome (She can choose how far it reaches up to a limit,) would be her time to shot before her reentry. This would give a dicy, more thrilling edge without making Wraith a deciding powerhouse.
Ash -
Ash sucks, it's a definitive truth, despite this she can be worked on and by providing more creative, stealthy tactics rather then a weaker skirmisher with no utility will provide the 3 Ash mains some comfort.
Passive - 
Ash's passive is great, but isn't codependent on her kit in any way (isn't bad, just nonsensical,) so her passive should a jump boost to jump higher on walls. (This ties in with tact.)
Tactical -
Her old tactical sucks. So create a new one, ""Shroud,"" a device that sticks to walls and allows her to hide and spectate. 
Secondary Tactical - 
After Hiding in her shroud and viewing the enemies from the void, she will get a ""Phase Shuriken,"" that allows her on accurate throw to change places with the enemy for the remainder of the allotted time or until an enemy breaks it. 
Ultimate -

Turn kill cam and kill quip off,"DISCLAIMER: I wouldn’t want to take these features away from people who want them/enjoy them, but I cannot tell you how much I would like to be able to turn them off for ME.



Ok, so I am not good at this game, and I like to play just every now and then.

But beyond the crushing difficulty of matchmaking, I find kill quips and the new addition of the kill cam very frustrating and downright depressing.

Like I said, Im not good at this game, I die a lot.
Most times you die, you get the privilege of hearing a character tell you that you suck or that they are better than you. I ALREADY KNEW THAT.

It’s just like rubbing it in my face, and it makes me not want to play. 

Kill cam similarly, I know I suck and I know that I died, why rub it in my face?

I’m not going to git gud, Im not going to go enroll in Apex Academy so that I can get even more stressed out about this game, I just play FOR FUN.

And having people tell me I suck, and rubbing my nose in it because I get killed IS NOT FUN.

Once again I don’t want to take this away from people, but I wish I could turn it off for me.

It would be nice if it could be something positive instead, like showing when you did damage or killed someone, would maybe help keep me playing. Same thing with kill quips.",apexlegends,1705508265.0,t3_1990d50

And when I'm finally in a match, I sometimes only get 1 teammate instead of 2. Or I'm completely alone.

Pre-Made Matchmaking,"I am sure I am not the first to talk about this. But,

Always boom dead, quit to main menu, start MM, 1 min passes, Lobby found, 58/60 players, let's wait another 1 min just to then start the round with 58 players, great now let's choose our legends, another min passes, this is your squad! (no shit???) this is your champion!! (I DON'T CARE JUST LET ME PLAY THE GAME)

I am new to Apex, just started mid season 17. Was this ever discussed in the community? It can' be that after clsoe to 20 seasons no one came up with the idea to easily reduce MM time by almost two minutes?

Should Loba be nerfed so she can’t grab heals and maybe shields with her ult?,"I main Wraith and Loba - they’re my 2 most played legends. Recently though with three strikes and because everyone has a lack of heals in that mode, I’ve become kind of frustrated with how scrubby people can be with Loba. Just using ult to steal all the batteries and evo shields in the area…Of course, the Loba is just doing what they’re supposed to be doing and providing loot/support and committing tax fraud. 

I do think it maybe is like genuinely unfair in a way though for the teams that are fighting and stuff like this can encourage ratting in ranked. It’s not like Loba is the sole cause for ratting or anything. Wraith, Horizon, Conduit are all played a lot more than she is, in all game modes. But just throwing Loba ult out, finding a God spot and then yanking evo shields from people fighting is absolutely something people do.

Nerfing her so she can’t grab heals would still give her and her ult a lot of utility. Thoughts?",apexlegends,1705504949.0,t3_198z0i4

"Conduit, Rev, and Stat Boosts","People have been talking about Conduit and her place in the game, and I think the interesting thing about her addition is the fact she came right after Rev Reborn. Both her and this new Rev have something no other Legend in the game has; a direct, uninterative stat boost.

There are plenty of stat boosts in the game, but all of them put emphasis on the action of the user. A speed boost, a handling improvement, a reload speed boost, none of those put up a ""wall"" that the other party hits against because the player with the stat boost pressed a button.

With Rev Reborn, there's a lot more interactivity with hitbox sizes and resets, but the point stands. Losing to Rev Reborn or a Conduit team because they ""just had more stats"" because they pressed a button is incredibly frustrating and uninteractive, in a way no other Legend is. The issue isn't that she heals, Lifeline heals and Wattson heals, the issue is that she offers a direct stat improvement that the opposing team can't do anything about.

I think this is worrying for the direction of abilities. Straight stat upgrades on a button press that the opponent is forced to break against is not healthy for any competitive game, it's too direct an advantage.",apexlegends,1705494588.0,t3_198vgl1

"To be honest, I was thinking about aim assist."," This is one idea, but wouldn't hip-fire aim assist be necessary? I think hip-fire aiming is difficult until you get used to it, whether it's keyboard mouse play or controller play. Also, if you play CS, you've probably experienced this at least once, but sometimes you get sucked in by an enemy you've knocked down, and your bullets don't hit the enemy the way you want. The aim is stuck to an enemy that is not the one you were aiming for. When performing flick operations, the hip-fired aim assist slows down the operation and causes the aim to point closer to you than you intended.  Aim assist is enabled only when aiming. How about introducing a system that allows you to switch, such as disabling aim assist only when shooting from the hip? ",apexlegends,1705479711.0,t3_198rqxl

My Patch Notes,"Before we start I want to mention I am trying to take in the fact of many factors like Competitive, casual and how to code/implement it.I am trying to buff weaker characters and overall trying to level the field.

Fuze:50% gernade resistance(no ultimates or abilities) 
Gives him more synergy and helps survivability

Ash:Ability to snare up to 2 people in one snare.Ult -30 sec and travel faster in phase.
The ability to snare 2 people would be a nice cc and making the ult up to par with wraith.

Ballistic:Passive swap time like if it had a blue stock, Weapon strafe speed in ult are reduce to a min of an AR,ex:LMG and snipers will have the same strafe speed as an AR and pistols and smg strafe speed will be inchaged.
It can give more variety to the ballistic and improve the feeling of using the ult.
 
Path:Passive to heal on zip, come on its a little obvious

Octane:If using tactical while reviving, 15% faster 
This may be big change but it will give Octane more of a team feel and playmaking ability.

Valk:Ult -30 sec  nothing big 

Crypto:Can ""Hack"" empty containers for extra mats +10 per. 
Crypto is a characters that preps so giving him this ability is not far off.

Seer:NO

Vantage:Tactical-echo will make a sound q signifying people near by. When person is hit with ult they do a sonar pulse every 2 second in a 8 meter radius,the scan works like old bloodhound scan.
These changes will make Vantage feel more rewarding and fit in her class.

Lifeline:tactical works like Newcastle tactical but slower,Ult only drop purple armor(no more blue armor)
Simple but effective changes to her kit.

Mirage:when bamboozled, .5 sec light arcstar stun(resets every second) and 5% damage intake for bamboozled effective duration.
Mirage's bamboozles never felt rewarding or punishing, I went with 5% damage intake over flat damage bc it would be annoying and not rewarding in higher level play.

Conduit:Tactical-space out the regeneration by 2 second
It's both a buff and nerf, you have it longer but less potent.

Loba:Passive-pinging shows items location ex:teammate pings ""I need sheilds"" it shows the shields with her passive. 1 pingable per person 
It could be hard to code in but This could be the push loba needs.

Caustic:tactical-deploy has 50 hp instead of 1 hp
Small buff to help him compete with the other controllers

Rampart: Tactical be able to through walls like caustic trap (can toggle off and on),Ult works like Vantage in 4 waves 
Rampart can be more active with these changes and be a aggressive as well.

Catalysts:Barricades without doors can be destroyed, have 200 hp 
This will tone back how annoying it is to fight against a catalysts.

If there anything you think should be changed Or can be added on, please let me know.",apexlegends,1705478079.0,t3_198rd6r

There needs to be a major rework for the control legends on Mixtape.,"Why is is it that these traps can stay up for the full length duration of a match where half of a team can easliy camp and be annoying. I don't have any legends that can counter them, it makes no sense. Make it so that their tacticals do not replinish on respawn, and have the traps sit on a timer. Its not tactical or strategic gameplay, its easy bs. Has anyone else seen how bad this is.

Maybe a few maps should be redesigned too IDK. Possibly limit how much a team can have (might not make sense) or add an ordinance to the game like a arc grenade from tf2 that disables them or can actually stun enemies.


Edit: All i wanted was to see if other people have had this problem before, or if anyone had any ideas or ways they may have fixed it for themselves.

No more of those fun late game situations because of… evac towers?,"I played about 5 games of ranked tonight, and maybe 5-10 the previous few days as a Diamond II. Probably 80% of the games had 15+ squads alive by the start of ring 3. 


Inevitably, this means that by the next ring I’m stuck with my solo q team hiding behind poor cover until another team can 30-30 us down. Sometimes we’re the team doing it, but regardless that’s not as fun. 


The fun part is beating a team 1 on 1, and that rarely seems to happen anymore. Either we swoop up an easy sweep or right when we’re winning another team starts taking pot shots. 


I wonder if the cause is because of evac towers. There’s no doubt it’s the most common survival item on the floor for some reason. Without evac towers, teams were forced to hold their ground in early ring 1 or 2 and rotators like path or valk or wraith were valuable for escaping. But now with evac towers everyone escapes every engagement, so then by ring 3 there’s 45 people alive. And now the support class is the most valuable class because if you don’t have an evac tower then you can craft",apexlegends,1705470324.0,t3_198pa0j

The recent brain-dead nerfs to weapons are a cancer that rigidifies the game. This must be rectified immediately.,"I am frustrated with the recent adjustments to SMG weapons, and it seems like the person responsible for these changes may not understand the concept of balance. The excessive weakening of R-99 and CAR is widely acknowledged, and I'd like to delve into the discussion using the SMG category as an example.

&#x200B;

In the same category, a strong contender is the Volt. The Volt's concept revolves around lower firepower and DPS but minimal recoil, providing versatility for mid-range coverage. In contrast, R-99 and CAR are specialized SMGs with high firepower compensated by challenging recoil.

&#x200B;

However, what is the current situation? Specialized SMGs cannot even compete with the Volt in terms of firepower, leading to a lack of incentive to choose them voluntarily. In other words, despite having multiple weapons, the practical choice is limited to using the Volt. The previously effective dynamic between specialized SMGs and versatile SMGs is disrupted. In some cases, adopting both types could have offered configurations excelling at close range while remaining effective at mid-range.

&#x200B;

But now, if one wishes to capitalize on both aspects, the only viable option is dual-wielding Volts. What is the appeal of such a scenario? Despite the existence of various weapon types in the SMG category, developers have stripped users of the opportunity to actively choose weapons, strategize, and have enforced a meta-game that aligns with their preferences, robbing users of the intended gaming experience.

&#x200B;

This trend is not limited to SMGs; it extends to the AR category as well. While introducing powerful new weapons adds freshness and excitement, the inexplicable decision to weaken the already well-balanced and stable R-301 upon introducing the Nemesis is baffling. There was absolutely no need to weaken the R-301 with the introduction of the Nemesis. I strongly advocate for an immediate return of the R-301 to its previous state.

&#x200B;

The intention to shift the meta is evident, but the forceful manner in which it is done often eliminates too many choices. Please consider carefully: what constitutes good balance in a game? In my opinion, it refers to a state where there is a balanced power dynamic among various elements within a certain range. Users should be able to strategically choose what they need from a variety of options, creating an ideal form. While making everything exactly the same is difficult, if strengths are concentrated within a certain range, a metagame develops, and users' tactics begin to shape the meta. This is the natural evolution the meta should take.

&#x200B;

I urge you to seriously reconsider this. I've expressed a lot, but recently, there seems to be a trend of making brain-dead nerfs to the meta, which feels quite absurd. Developers, please understand the game better and make adjustments that require thoughtful consideration. It appears there is a struggle with adjusting SMGs and shotguns recently, but I believe the key to resolving this lies in engagement distance. I hope for a balance adjustment that involves maneuvering in close and extremely close quarters.

&#x200B;

The recent updates continue to weaken the current meta weapons, frustrating me with the limited choices. While many express a desire for a 30-30 nerf in this thread, I believe it's essential to look at the root cause. The attempts to forcefully shift the meta with nerfs to G7, R-301, Nemesis, and Hemlok led to the prominence of the 30-30, which wasn't initially a highly-used weapon. As options were relentlessly reduced, more people are using it simply because there's nothing else. Continuing this adjustment path might lead to an increase in Triple Takes or Nemesis, resulting in more nerfs. What's the point of such a cycle? The current situation is the outcome of mindlessly nerfing weapons that had proven themselves as viable alternatives without balancing against others. It feels incredibly absurd.

&#x200B;

I hope for a more thoughtful and comprehensive adjustment in Season 20, rather than resorting to brain-dead nerfs.",apexlegends,1705449263.0,t3_198i1iq

Discord q teams,"I have seen discor communities team up in games before, particularly warzone but I have been noticing apex is having the same issue. 3 games straight, several teams targeting specific teams and then not engaging each other. 

I noticed this pattern a few days ago but today, I even bothered to spectate and in my face, I watch several teams rotate in a way to pinch the ""outsider"" and then they take turns looting and even while being in each others sights, they dont shoot each other. 

Several of those people I spectate rocking master and predator badges and its hilarious. Its hilarious I win most my 1s vs a pred or masters and cant get out of plat. And its hilarious Im watching some insane teaming.

Sure, it can happen randomly but the fact for 3 games straight I spectated people running together and wprking together in ranked. At this point, I strongly believe that more than half of the high ranked players are cheating, teaming and what not.

3. When people relinquish jumpmaster and then make suggestions for where to land.

4. Related to number 1, when you ping an item for a teammate they pick it up and not say thanks.

5. When people don’t speak the entire game and then they turn on their mic at the end of the game to complain. Like why weren’t you communicating the WHOLE time?

Idea(s) for S20.,"Here are a few things I think if Apex did in Season 20, that would retain and bring more/back players.

1- Legend Tokens. 

Lets make a use for these, any item in the store that is Epic or lower should be able to be bought with Legend Tokens, and Legendary should be crafting materials or apex coins.


2- Ranked ELO system.

Trials are by far the worst thing ever, especially for solo players. MMR is also awful because nobody (i think including respawn) knows how it works. Just make it a straight up Elo system with a leaderboard.


3- Star system.

Solo-queuing is terrible. Introduce a star system, so you know how others rate their teammates, and to combatant ""fake"" ratings, you can see how often the person who rated them rates other people.

EX- you can click on someone's star rating, and see their last 5-10, and click on the person who gave them that rating to see if they are just trolls or someone who actually rates.

Definitely my least favorite LTM.,"For reference, I have been playing apex since the second day it came out; I have played every mode that has come out - from the winter express (my favorite), scopes & scatter guns, Halloween mode, etc. My first problem with this mode, you cannot turn it off. I should absolutely have the option to play regular trios to avoid the shenanigans.
 On top of that, this mode is here for 3 weeks - way too long for it to be the only trios option (other than ranked, which has a broken point system imo.) 
Reason 3, the swords. A game with some of the best gunplay around has now subjected itself to a cheesy gimmick of a two-hit-wonder-weapon. I can wander into the open, block your bullets, then charge at you in half a second, launching you into the air and cracking your shield in one swipe. Bullets do not slow the swordsman either.
Reason 4, while I do enjoy some aspects of the materia upgrades, they are way too apparent in the game, and the nessies are an absolute pest. Easy to kill, but they inevitably respawn, and become nothing but aim bots - further ruining the integrity of the game. 

Anyone else feel the same way? Or am I speaking into the void?",apexlegends,1705383298.0,t3_197v7pg

During this FF7 event, I opened 38 event packs.  I have every legendary item, every epic item and 3 iconic skins.  So, all 35 items and 3 iconic items, 38 total items.

I do not have it.  Am I missing something?  Why do I not have the buster sword heirloom or the death box?  I don't even care about the death box, but should I not have the buster sword?

"Hot Take: Promo Trials are good, but they need to change it.","I like that there is some sort of Gatekeep mechanic to discourage ratting all the way to Diamond. But they need to change it, because the currently implementation is beyond frustrating. I just had a game with 10 kills, but OH SORRY you didn't get Top5,  your squad died #6,  so doesn't count for the Promo Trial from Gold to Plat!

My suggestion is to make it like ALGS,  sort of. Once you enter Trials, every one of your Trial games is being counted. Points for Placement, Points for Kills etc.  You'll always do 3 Trial games and at the end of it, points from all 3 games are added up and you need to beat a certain threshhold to succeed the promo.

Much better than getting 10 kills in a game and it's all for nothing because your squad died #6 instead of Top5.",apexlegends,1705373052.0,t3_197rubl

Thought I'd enjoy a day off playing some Apex. After a few hours it was enough to observe why it wasn't enjoyable. The game simply gets in the way of itself. I don't think the game is stale, it just needs QOL improvements big time.

I warmed up with Mixtape for a bit...

1. I get legitimately unplayable stuttering on the Caustic treatment map only. So if that's in the rotation, have to find something else...
2. Wait for TDM, get a match where three of our six players finished with zero kills and 200-400 damage while the other team is full of 4k 20 bomb players averaging 2500 damage each.
3. Oh and Audio randomly gets completely muted and muffled now since the latest patch

Okay time to move on to Battle Royale, oh right, its a forced LTM. Get my 2 games worth of rewards points, dying to a sword in a few hits each time. Nice...  


Alright time to hit up my ONE friend that still plays this game and try and chill on ranked because no Trios...

I kid you not, three games in a row our random decided to afk rat in some corner the whole time because well, ratting is rewarded more than kills...

Issues when playing in a party with my friend,"Hi all. Recently, I've started playing Apex on PC (I played it before on PS4 and switched to PC when cross-progression became available). I have this one friend I usually play with, and back when I played on PS4, we played with each other  without major issues. However, ever since I switched to PC, playing with him became almost impossible. Whenever I play in a party with him, I'd get kicked out of matches like 70-80% of the time (as in, I'd get kicked out either on the legend selection screen or right after that) and I can almost never rejoin the match. But when I play alone, I never encounter this issue and all my matches start properly with no notable issues. My friend is on PS4, if that helps

Not that it does any good. They'll just be back in 5 seconds.

If the enemy team has two of them, they deal serious damage. Forget about using a shield cell. There's a fucking nessie after you.

And who decided that they would attack downed players?! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? *Oh you want to find cover? Haha, sucks for you! I have a  thirst machine!*

"I’m sorry Respawn, but this is where you lost me","700 coins for 1 pack.
7000 for 10. 
You only get two packs from challenges. 

That’s horrible. Just... Wow. 

Then you decide to make it so that if you unlock all 24 skins, you then get an “option” to BUY the Heirloom for 3500 coins?! 

I’m sorry Respawn, but the scum of EA has been wiped all over you and you have lost my belief in this game. 

It’s a damn shame as well cause I’ve already invested A LOT of time and money in your game because I thought it was amazing and you actually deserved it, but man... You messed up so badly. 

I understand that people will defend this. I don’t blame you. I actually tried my very best to be on Respawns’ side on this. But they make a lot of money already (no I don’t know the exact amount, but if the company is still running and doing well to push out content, then turnover is high. It makes sense from a business perspective), just from normal Apex packs alone. This has taken things to a new level of scum.

EDIT:

Woah, I’m trending! I wish it was for better circumstances and it would be me praising the game. It’s sad that it’s about something negative, but thank you all for voicing your opinions and I hope this post and many others actually makes Respawn wake up and realize that what they are doing is just horrible. 

But thank you for expressing your opinions. Some are positive, some are negative, and some criticize what I’m saying - and that’s all fine. 

So from comments, a majority of people state the following thing: 

— “Give me stats if you think the company is making money” 

I’m obviously not going to have analytics data  now am I. But if a company is doing well and they are regularly pushing content over a huge time gap, that means they are making a great turnover. If I could find their financial statement for a tax year, then sure. I’m not an auditor, but feel free to look it up yourself (if it’s available),

— “But you invest money into the game, so you’re the cause of the problem” 

I get you on this. Addiction is a thing, but that’s not what I do. I have a set budget that I use every month and I never go over it. Basically, I buy 2150 coins every month and that’s it. I have bills to pay, family to support, a life to live and I refuse to spend more than that. 

I do this because I support the game and I want to get new skins, banners and all that good stuff, but charging a ridiculous amount for a limited time is a scummy move and that’s how my opinion remains. You’re free to have your own; it’s not my place to stop you. 

— “but it’s a F2P game, who cares. Just play the game” 

You’re making sense, but reward factor is important to others. Yes, you can get a reward factor based on playing with friends, winning, getting kills, etc and that’s great, but not everybody thinks like you. You can’t base an entire community over your own belief. That’s why we have opinions. 

— “F2P games are designed for you to not unlock everything and to make a purchase” 

That is correct; but at a reasonable price. Not everyone on this world can afford to dish out a crap-ton of money, but they still want to get those items. 

Take note that there’s a sense of addiction that falls into people being tempted to purchase items at exorbitant prices with risk of their bank accounts going into low/negative numbers. 


— “EA is taking over Respawn” 

Not surprised about that, but it can also be Respawn that says yes to it. It works both ways. 

— “I’m not paying that much” 

Good on you. I hope that Respawn actually sees this and realize that their player base determines the fate of their company and it’s not just EA. 

— “I stopped playing this game” 

I personally haven’t played myself since I downloaded the update. Not because Apex is a bad game. Apex is an awesome game with awesome gameplay mechanics. 

But the price of these items left a bad taste in my mouth and I just ended up closing the game. I just got put off with it. 

— “Wouldn’t they make more money if the packs were cheaper?” 

I absolutely think so! With that exorbitant price, they’re targeting a niche market and isolating the rest. If they made a pack like 200 coins (just because there’s a 50% chance for a legendary), then I think most people would be fine with that and more people would ACTUALLY buy it. 

Also, if you made the skins available on purchase or give challenges to unlock some of them, that would be even better! But, that’s not how r-EA-spawn thinks.

EDIT 2: 

Okay, I'm at the top of the page! 

It's amazing to see that thenpost is getting a lot of traction. Its awesome to see that I'm not alone in feeling this way! 

There are a bunch of people thay don't agree with my opinion and thats fine! I get that is is a F2P game and THERE WILL BE microtransacrions, I get that. But I ask you to think about what is actually a reasonable price and what is not. Weve been complaining for a long time ovee the prices in the store, but dont yiu think that 7000 coins for 10 Apex Packs is too much? 

You're welcome to think how how you feel, but many others don't feel the same. Please respect their opinions the same as how I wm respecting yours. 

Finally, i apologize for the spelling! I know, its exorbitant! I was sleep-typing as i was updating my post and the joys of autocorrect got the best of me!

ANOTHER EDIT: 

So I’m getting a lot of DM’s. Some are of people actually making a discussion with me and giving me an opinion as to why they think I’m wrong. 

It’s awesome that I get the opportunity to have a civil conversation with me where we can express our opinions. I love that!

"Many users experiencing crashes, EA support denying or ignoring. Please signal boost this.","The EA support forums are exploding with people having this crash to desktop error, with usually no error code or a generic memory error code.  

People cannot find a common thread between peoples systems or set ups that can cause this, with many people of different hardware and OS all having this issue. 

However; EA has denied any problems outright, saying it's the users problem, not the game's. 
https://i.imgur.com/uZGm1tT.jpg

Please help spread this so maybe they'll actually pay attention, many people can't play this game right now and they're not acknowledging it! 

Thank you. 


Edit : I should share some more context for the cap.
The post I screencapped was from a thread called ""crashing unacceptable."" and was about how the larger thread about the random crashes, the one of 50 pages of people posting specs + error logs,(And was the busiest thread in the technical support forum) has not gotten a response yet and how the community has tried everything, cannot find a common thread between system specs, and that at this point they need assistance.


 That was EA's reply. Despite 600+ posts and 50 pages of error logs and crash reports from various machines, windows versions, etc. Their reply was claiming ignorance and saying it's just some specific problem with your machine.


Also : I'm aware 600 posts is very small for the sheer amount of people playing this game.  Yet keep this in mind : IT'S STILL ONE OF THE LARGEST ISSUES ON THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT FORUM. 
Meaning that OF THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING ISSUES, this issue is the biggest and most frustrating. It is what the majority of people who go to the /technical support/ forums need support for! So maybe that should be a sign?

Some Clarity Around Datamining and Season 1," Hey Friends,

So between the datamining and the unintentional update about Season 1 on Origin today, there’s been a lot of speculation and confusion so we wanted to give some clarity:

&#x200B;

* We’ll be providing details on Season 1, Battle Pass, and the next Legend very soon. It’s not coming out today. 
* There’s lots of stuff that has been datamined from Apex since launch and is swirling around the Internet. We know this stuff is fun to dig up and speculate about, but you should not treat any of that info as a source of truth. There’s stuff in there that is very old, or things we’ve tried in the past and cut--remember our design process is to prototype and play lots of ideas--and some of it may be things we’re still building for Apex Legends.

You dropped your shield when we called for it so we could take cover and healed.  
You may have missed all your shots but when we pushed, you pushed with us.  
When you found purple armor, you let us have it cause you saw we were filthy tryhards who were gonna need it.
And at the end of the game you typed ""thanks for the carry."" 
And we may have carried the game, but you, thiccboi supreme Gibraltar, you carry our hearts.

"I like to bring this up to light but dear Respawn, I can't play the Bocek because I'm afraid of picking up arrows. I have sparkalaphobia and epilepsy.","This is not a joke and I'll hope to bring it up to anyone.

I've been an avid player since season 0 week 1 and this is the 1st season that I can't truly play. To explain sparkalaphobia, it's the fear of glitter, it may sound odd or laughable but it is uncomfortable to me.

https://preview.redd.it/ztppoe8qjlx61.png?width=1727&format=png&auto=webp&s=54610b02cc6a7b773b421557fb14e258a36444d4

Edit 2: I think some people are overemphasising the phobia. It's not the glitter I'm scared of but the overexposure of light that's the issue. I can stare at a static image no problem, give me a white noise channel and I'm fine, Christmas ornament sure too, but once you flicker a halogen while it rotates, the reflections start to hurt. That's what scares me, the sudden tense sensation rushing behind your skull, the burning image in your eyes, the snapping of your neck from the jerk. Then it hits you, brain.exe gets deleted and you stare into the abyss as if blindness took over. The worse is that with brain.exe dead, your body can forget to breath and you drown in lifelessness until it all comes back. That's what scares me.

The problem are the arrow fetching and the pulsing yellow highlight. Every time there are multiple arrows shimmering (especially in the firing range), I feel uneasy, the pulse gets under my skin and the more arrows there are, the more uncomfortable it becomes. Sometimes to the point I have to force close and cradling myself, because I can feel like an epileptic seizure coming

Can there be an accessibility option to turn ammo matte solid without the pulsing please? Maybe an alternative VFX where it doesn't pulse but a molten transitioning gradient like the gif below or like the Evo shield VFX.

Thank you for reading this.

Edit:

The main issue is the VFX pattern looks like dotted embossing shimmering through the arrow. One may argue that the VFX has been there on other ammo since season 0 but the difference is their primary colour overpowers/ outshines the ammo box so I don't notice much. The arrow on the other hand have the VFX overwhelm the model.

I also tried all colourblind modes and it doesn't change the VFX or colour for a matter of fact.

&#x200B;

[An accessibility option for a VFX like this to highlight ammo instead.](https://i.redd.it/xa33jwxivix61.gif)

Edit 3: I have had no problem with other effects so far, only this due to its slow frequency. Thermite, L-stars, Octane's border stim, Fuse Tactical, Mirage Voyage, are fast dissipating moving effects. Purple skins (especially blue with squares and orange dots) are minor issues because animation move enough to not be a hindrance, on the otherhand, can't stare at the preview for more than 3 minutes.",apexlegends,1620309093.0,t3_n67r39

Respawn please don't support this!,"One of the big apex streamers is now playing on console because of cheaters on Pc but has decided it would be better to play on Xbox using mouse and keyboard via a xim adapter huh???

Very hypocritical. 

This is not fair on the console community this being promoted in this way. 
This should not be being streamed at all and to a big audience like this it will ruin the game on ps4/xbox.  
People are explaining how to set this stuff up in chat etc and it shows it's a problem that needs to be addressed!

Edit - My first ever gold times 3 now thank yous all so much whoever you are! Glad to see this getting attention.

Edit 2 - My oh my did this blow up. Well thanks everyone for there opinions and support etc All we can look forward to now is to hear Respawns opinion have a great day legends :)

"Over a decade ago I played counterstrike. Each match we won or lost; no xp, no reward. I think we need to ask ourselves why we play a game.","I guess I'm sad that things have changed and games have to drip feed pieces of candy to maintain a happy playerbase these days. I played hundreds maybe thousands of hours of cs 1.6 and had nothing more than a day 1 player, except knowledge and skill. The reward was a kill, a win, holding a site when rushed. 

I suppose I'm also a bit of a sucker for this since I get caught up in it, I get that buzz, when a purple or gold laser fires from one of the spinning triangles. What's mad is literally everything that could drop doesn't really bother me that much. When I step back I'm playing because I enjoy the game, not because my pathfinder is now more pink or my r301 shiny.

I think we might forget the way it used to be and our addiction to shiny rewards tarnishes our true enjoyment of a well made game. So take a moment when you see a lackluster battlepass or no packs after level 100 and ask how much you really care about what is in them and why you are playing in the the first place.

Edit: Thank you for the silver/gold/platinum. This post has obviously caused some controversy. I feel I want to say that I'm not here rampaging against lootboxes and cosmetics.
I do however think people should ask are they playing because they enjoy the game or because they are caught in an addictive loop of rewards. Those who think that is rare only need see the number of people saying they stopped playing at level 100 etc to see this isn't that unusual.  
Also each to their own, if lootboxes are why you play things that fine, but I'd argue Apex probably isn't for you.
I guess my concern is if people think new cosmetics, lootboxes etc will keep things fresh and keep the playerbase up and I believe if we take a step back, their superficial nature will only achieve superficial results.

For context, I just finished playing this morning with a young man who had a pretty nasty cough. I hopped on the mic to check if he was ok, and this is how the conversation went:

Me: ""Hey little buddy, are you ok? Can you breathe?""

Him: ""Yes I'm kay, I don't have the COVID-CORONA""

Me: ""Ok, just making sure. Did you drink some water?""

Him: ""Oh, ya. I drink my dad's water. But my dad and my mom got into a fight, and they broke up. I stay with my grandma now. But then my great-grandma died and I got really sad. I just turned 6. I just had my birthday. Do you have light ammo?""

Honestly...it was one of those moments that reminds you, its just a game. We don't need to rage, we don't need to yell at people...there are things that are so much worse than TtK or bad teamplay.

Poor little dude. I hope you get all the light ammo in every game, ever.

2.15.2019: An Update From Respawn,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/thhn6qshuug21.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e84f34461f6807c6752acb7cabaf0654423469f7

Lots to talk about! 

&#x200B;

**THE CRASHES**

We know this has been frustrating for many of you across all platforms. We hear you and we take this issue seriously. Improving stability, performance, and quality of life is a big priority for us and we have a lot of work to do. We pushed our first patch out earlier this week and we’ve got many more coming \[including one next week!\]. We’ll always provide patch notes when these come out. No I can’t tell you what’s in it yet. 

&#x200B;

**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I REPORT SOMETHING?**

We’re always listening and looking for reported issues. As you can imagine, when you drop your game out of nowhere and 25 million people show up in the first week, there’s going to be all kinds of issues, bugs, exploits, etc. discovered. Our customer service team provides daily reports and many folks on the dev team are finding and emailing links of reported issues across social channels and reddit. We’ve also got some rad tools that capture all kinds of data from the game, measure sentiment, and provide insight into what the most talked about things are around Apex Legends. 

When issues are reported they are curated by our wonderful QA team who attempts to reproduce the issue based on the info they have. If they are able to reproduce it, a ticket is created and they are added to the rest of the known issues, prioritized, scheduled, and assigned to the proper devs to address it. How do we prioritize? We use data to inform us of how many people are being affected, how damaging the exploit could be, how much resources it would take to fix it, etc. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/emm6m87kuug21.jpg?width=8379&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da360df71f5f8745edef189599375a9e0a6009ba

**HELP US HELP YOU**

If we can’t reproduce the issue locally, it’s pretty impossible to fix it. That’s why it’s super important that when you report an issue you’re experiencing, you provide as much information as possible. If you just post: “My game keeps crashing. Fix it.”, there’s not a lot we can do to help you, and we really want to help you! 

So, help us help you. Best place to report bugs is using the link below and following some steps:

[https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/bd-p/apex-legends-bug-reports-en](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/bd-p/apex-legends-bug-reports-en) 

* What platform are you playing on?
* Origin ID / Gamertag / PSN
* What were you doing leading up to the issue?
* Can you reproduce it? What are the steps?
* PC players - provide hardware specs, OS version and GPU driver version.
* If possible, it’s great if you can capture a screenshot / picture or video. 
* Pay attention for dev updates. 

&#x200B;

**CHEATERS**

As of today over 16,000 cheaters have been identified and banned from the game. Cheaters suck. If you run into one, please try and capture the evidence and let us know here: [https://www.easy.ac/en-us/support/apexlegends/contact/report/](https://www.easy.ac/en-us/support/apexlegends/contact/report/)

Even if you don’t get proof, get their ID and flag it and we can investigate the account. We have heard your feedback about a report feature in the game. I’ll just say that’s a very good idea :)

&#x200B;

**OUR ONGOING CONVERSATION**

Your trust is truly important to us. Seriously. We said at launch that we will always strive to be direct, honest, and as transparent as we can with all of you. This is how we’ll be starting to do that:

* We’re going to start doing more regular updates like this moving forward. I’ll be making posts daily starting Tuesday next week. Not all of these will be ground breaking or major news but think of it as our way of checking in each day to address what we can.
* Livestreams! As we speak, a production team is building a rad soundstage and set right here at Respawn. I can’t wait to get it up and running and start putting on shows with the team. We will debut our first developer stream around the launch of Season 1. 
* With the permission of you all and the mod team, I’d like to have a dedicated spot here where I can provide a list of troubleshooting tips for some issues folks are having. 
* Couple more things in the works that we'll talk about more in the near future.  

&#x200B;

I wish I could respond to each and every one of you but it’s physically impossible. For context: I currently have nearly 6K responses and over 50 message requests in my inbox, and that’s just this subreddit. Trust me when I say that myself, and many folks on the team are here reading your posts and it’s been the best feeling seeing our baby out in the wild and taking on a life of its own through you. 

&#x200B;

"Man, these new daily challenges are getting ridiculous",,apexlegends,1562801349.0,t3_cbo5px
The Battle Pass is way too grindy - does not feel rewarding,"Maybe it's this BP season in particular because the skins aren't great (R99 looks cool), but these new challenges and 'battle star' system is extremely grindy. I've finished all of my daily quests and I still haven't leveled from 1 - 2 until I get my bonus star from xp.

* In past seasons, respawning 5 squadmates was 1 BP Lvl. Now Respawning 15 squadmates is 2 stars!
* 40 knockdowns is 2 stars?
* You have to win 5 games to get 5 stars which is only half a BP lvl.
* Get 10 knockdowns with weapons from a care package? Do you know how hard this is for the average player?
   * This only grants 5 stars.
* It takes 10k xp to get 1 star... so 100k xp for 1 BP lvl. Previous BP xp track was 9/18/27/36/54... so basically we're getting 1 BP lvl for every 4 we would have gotten last season.
* Last season we also had weekly challenges of ""Complete 5/10 daily quests"" for 2 BP lvl every week. This is now gone.
* The rewards/cosmetics this season are mediocre at best. If you make grinding twice as hard, the rewards need to be better.
   * More apex packs, coins, maybe a dive trail?
* Season 7 xp boosts only affect BP progression and not your actual account level progression. 
   * This makes it harder to reach 500 and to unlock rewards along the way (apex packs, heirloom shards, etc).

Overall this feels quite unrewarding. I dont think i'll have the time to max the BP this season and now I dont even really want to try. I honestly regret this purchase which is the first time that's happened for me and the BP. I *really* should have checked to see what the progression was like before buying the BP. If I knew, there's no chance I would have spent my coins on this.

Edit: added more to list

Edit 2: There's quite a few posts out there about Respawn intentionally doing this.

This sub is a joke.,"Title. The fact that most of you feel the need to make the developers feel like absolute shit for something you don't even have to pay for is probably the most defining quality of this sub: Entitlement.

The battle pass isn't great. So what? Most things aren't wonderful at launch, but truth be told, you guys brought this on yourselves. You hyped yourselves beyond belief that nothing could have possibly surpassed your expectations. There could be a new skin with every battle pass tier and you would probably find some way to dislike even that.

I hope the devs stop coming here. They don't deserve this type of verbal abuse, honestly. Work on a game for years, release it for free and provide a measly $10 entry fee for extra content (and the ability to get the NEXT battle pass for free) and the response is ""wow trash"".

Jesus. What a joke.

I did some number crunching to figure out how much value you can get from your 950 Apex Coins.,"I wanted to take the opportunity (before Season 1 begins for real in a couple of hours) to try and quantify the value of the Battle Pass in easy to understand numbers, and to try and evaluate whether or not the Battle Pass is actually a good investment or not. I'm not commenting on the quality of the items in the Battle Pass, I'm just figuring out how much the items in the Battle Pass are worth, based on the current pricing of items in the game.

The Season 1 Battle Pass includes:

* 1000 x Apex Coins
* 20 x rare weapon skins
* 1 x epic weapon skin (I assume the golden Prowler skin is epic because it's highlighted)
* 3 x rare character skins
* 9 x stat trackers
* 9 x intro quips
* 9 x rare banner frames 
* 5 x Apex Packs
* 1 x Epic Apex Pack
* 1 x Legendary Apex Pack
* 1 x Legendary weapon skin

Now, based on this information alone, we can deduce a preliminary total value (in Apex Coins) of all the items you receive if you reach level 100.

First, we have the 1000 Apex Coins. That is pretty easy. It's just 1000 Apex Coins. 

Next up, we have the Apex Packs. We know the price of one Apex Pack is 100 Apex Coins, so we can conclude that 5 Apex Packs = 500 Apex Coins, but then there's the two additional Apex Packs that guarantee an Epic item or greater, and a Legendary item or greater. 
For the sake of argument, let's also put those at 100 Apex Coins, considering we don't have any basis for any other value.
That totals to 700 Apex Coins for all the Apex Packs.

Now comes the Legendary Weapon skin for the Havoc. We know, based on the in-game store, that Legendary skins are priced at 1800 Apex Coins. So this one was also fairly easy to deduce. 

Now comes the tricky part: How to quantify the value of common, rare and epic items.

We start by figuring out what constitutes a common item, a rare item or an epic item:

* For character and weapon skins it's fairly easy to figure out: A solid color reskin is a common skin. A pattern (like tiger stripes, camo, etc.) is considered rare. If the reskin has an animated texture, it is considered epic. A complete remodel of the character is a Legendary skin.
* For intro quips, the difference between common quips and rare quips is that there's an added sound effect in the background for rare intro quips.
* For banner frames, the difference lies in whether or not the banner frame includes objects in the foreground that obfuscate your character. Like a pickaxe, brances, kunai knives, etc. Legendary banner frames tend to break the barrier and are also animated.
* For stat trackers, rare trackers only track a statistic available to that one specific character. Like Caustic's gas damage, or Pathfinder's distance traveled by zipline, or Lifeline's healbot heals.

Based on this information, we can deduce that the character skins, weapon skins and banner frames are all rare quality items. 
I cannot say for certain if the trackers and intro quips are common or rare quality items, but I'll assume they are common, for lack of evidence to the contrary.

So in total, we have:

* 32 x rare items
* 18 x common items
* 1 x epic item

for a total of 51 items.

Now, if we had to acquire all these items in a conventional way (i.e. by unlocking them with Apex Packs), we would have to spend enough Apex Coins to buy (51 / 3 = 17) 17 Apex Packs. That's 1700 Apex Coins.


So, if we add all this together, we get:

    1000 +
     700 +
    1800 +
    1700 =
    ______
    5200 Apex Coins
    
You gain items and coins worth 5200 Apex Coins by spending 950 Apex Coins and reaching level 100.
    	
______

But wait, I'm not done yet!

If we stop assuming you ""got"" these items through Apex Packs, and instead got them through buying them directly, the equation changes drastically.

Now, as we all know, we cannot buy common, rare and epic items in the shop directly, so we don't know their value in Apex Coins.
 
But we *do* know the value of a Legendary item, *and* we know how much they cost to craft with crafting metals. So we know the conversion rate between Crafting metals and Apex Coins.

Basically, 1 Crafting Metal is worth 1.5 Apex Coins (1800 AC / 1200 CM = 1.5). And from that we can figure out the Apex Coin value of the other tiers:

Rarity tier|Crafting metal value|Conversion Rate|Apex Coins value
:---|---:|---:|---:
Common|30|1.5|**45**
Rare|60|1.5|**90**
Epic|400|1.5|**600**
Legendary|1200|1.5|1800

If we take these values and use those instead to calculate the worth of the items, we would end up with the following result:

    Common items:    18 *   45 =  810 coins
	Rare items:      32 *   90 = 2880 coins
	Epic items:       1 *  600 =  600 coins
	Legendary items:  1 * 1800 = 1800 coins
    _______________________________________
    Total:						 6090 coins

Combine that with the 1000 Apex Coins and 7 Apex Packs:

    6090 +
	1000 +
	 700 =
	______
	7790 Apex Coins

And we end up with a whopping **7790 Apex Coins** in value for the small price of 950 Apex Coins.

Live Balance Update live on all platforms - let's talk about meta,"Hey everyone!

&#x200B;

First off, we know you folks are fired up for info on Season 1 and Battle Pass. We still have work to do to get everything ready for prime time and won’t be talking about it yet. There are a lot of moving parts and coordination that go into big announcements and launches like this. I know the wait sucks but it’s coming and ask that you all please be patient with us.

Over the course of this week we’ll be talking about a few hot topics and we’re kicking things off today with a patch that is live on all platforms with some fixes, our first tweaks to the meta, and we'll give a preview of how we’ll be addressing Legend balance and hitboxes for Season 1. To talk about how we’re thinking about game balance and some changes we’ve made, I’d like introduce designers, Lee, Sean, and Brent who will give their POV and we’ll all stick around for a bit to answer questions.

**I want to set the expectation that there will be lots of things we can’t talk about yet. We won’t be confirming or revealing any future content or features in the questions.**

&#x200B;

I’ll let the guys take it from here:

&#x200B;

Leeeeeee-RSPN here with RespawnSean, Jayfresh\_Respawn & Scriptacus to give a quick update on how we think about live balance at Respawn and the current state of live balance for Apex.

&#x200B;

**HOW WE THINK ABOUT LIVE BALANCE AT RESPAWN**

https://preview.redd.it/i3dk528qzkk21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38e6830c2caaccd9ae06d7574c5169b26a36b785

***TL;DR - We make less frequent, better tested, higher impact balance changes in order to minimize the impacts on your time spent mastering the game.***

&#x200B;

A core philosophy of our development process for Apex Legends is to listen to player feedback, parse through all the data we get from the game, try things, and then playtest them a ton to get them just right. And… repeat. The goal is to ship polished, closer to the mark updates than if we got things out rapidly and iterated in the live environment.  We know y'all are putting a ton of time into the game and mastering every nuance (like Wraith portalling people off cliffs for the final kill lolz).  Our goal is to make less frequent, better tested, higher impact changes, so it minimizes the effects on your time spent mastering a particular mechanic, weapon, character, etc.  You shouldn't have to read our patch notes every few days just to keep up with how characters and weapons now work.

The exception here is that we will be very quick to adjust things that are way out of balance (for example, if we released a new character that completely dominates the meta from Day 1, we'd address it ASAP).

We didn’t want to make any hasty changes around launch, because we know a ton of players are still learning the game with lots of new Legends dropping in everyday.  The week one meta vs. the week two / three meta was meaningfully different from what we've seen, so want to make it sure it settles a bit before we act.  For example, Mirage’s power level has dropped a bit as players have adapted to getting Bamboozled.  :)  We want to let you know we're constantly reviewing the state of the game and considering and testing a variety of changes.

&#x200B;

**With the above philosophy in mind, I wanted to give a quick update on where we stand with the current state of character and weapon balance and provide an early preview of the things we’re planning to do for Season 1.**

&#x200B;

**WEAPON BALANCE**

https://preview.redd.it/fj9qpgvrzkk21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a15f9b67aeacc3a8f072d1746c50737b505c0841

&#x200B;

Overall, we feel that the current weapons present solid options for a variety of gameplay styles.  We've found that the **Skullpiercer Wingman** has been on the stronger end, but it’s designed to be a weapon with a higher skill ceiling.  Our adjustments are attempting to move it more into the hand cannon space and away from full auto Deagle.  We’ve also adjusted the rate of fire of the **Peacekeeper with Shotgun Bolt** attachment, so players will have a larger window of vulnerability if they miss their shot.  Additionally, the scarcity of energy ammo and lower number of energy weapons overall has made those weapons difficult to main, so we’ve increased energy weapon and ammo availability.

&#x200B;

**WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS LIVE ON ALL PLATFORMS**

* **Wingman**
   * Rate of fire reduced from 3.1 -> 2.6 shots per second.
   * Skullpiercer Headshot damage multiplier reduced from 2.5 -> 2.25
   * Increased base hip fire spread and decreased the rate at which hip fire spread decays (shrinks back down).
* **Peacekeeper**
   * Shotgun Bolt rechamber rate has been reduced for the Peacekeeper only.
      * Level 1 mitigation 10% -> 7.5%
      * Level 2 mitigation 20% -> 13%
      * Level 3 mitigation 25% -> 16%
* Wingman and Peacekeeper availability has been reduced in all zone tiers.
* Increased availability of energy weapons & ammo in all zone tiers.

&#x200B;

**Why no P2020 or Mozambique buffs?**

* We love y’all’s ‘Bique memes, so we’re hesitant to lose that :P
* In all seriousness, our goal is to have a power curve of weapons.  ""Power curve"" just means that some weapons will be weaker and more common, while others will be stronger and rarer. Some weapons are intentionally less powerful until fully purp’d with hopups and attachments, while other weapons on the bottom of the power curve are your early game, better-than-melee, but-gotta-upgrade-out-of-ASAP weapons. We’ve seen some good feedback from players about how to make these pistols more exciting without losing out on the goal above that we’re listening to. We’ll be continuing to watch player data and feedback and trying things out internally but for now, they’ll remain the same.

&#x200B;

**ADDITIONAL PATCH NOTES**

* Fixed some script errors that we identified were occasionally causing disconnects during matches.
   * Caustic occasionally causing disconnects while throwing is Ultimate.
   * Pathfinder occasionally causing disconnects when activating a Survey Beacon.
   * Players occasionally causing disconnects when removing an attachment.
   * Gibraltar occasionally causing disconnects when pulling up his Gun Shield.
   * Players occasionally causing disconnects when entering Spectate Mode.

&#x200B;

**ADDRESSING LEGEND BALANCE AND HITBOX FEEDBACK**

https://preview.redd.it/taz9cycvzkk21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ca248b59aa8404898e173a365f861a34625b79f

***TL;DR  Our goal is to be able to have characters with different rig sizes, hitboxes and ability kits, and still have each character be roughly equal in power level, win rate and viability of pick.***

&#x200B;

For character balance, we look at a combination of things: pick rate, win rate, and character v. character matchup win rate among other metrics, and, of course, player feedback.  The results between the 5 small and medium rig characters have been positive - they are all in a safe band of relatively equal power.  Our large rig characters, however, are underpowered and their natural size appears to be a large contributor.  We’re planning on adjusting the size of the large character hitboxes to better fit the model.  If these changes are insufficient to bring these characters in line, we’re also considering a range of other changes such as natural damage reduction as well as individual kit power tweaks.  Because many of these changes are significant, we want to make sure they are heavily tested before they go live, in the event they are necessary.  Below is a quick overview on the roadmap of how we’re thinking about bringing large characters back in line.

Overall, we want to try to **increase the power level of the large rig characters**, before we consider large nerfs to everyone else.  While we’ve made small adjustments, we’re hopeful that increasing the power of large rigs is healthier than nerfing everyone else.

&#x200B;

**LEGEND ADJUSTMENTS WE'LL MAKE AT THE START OF SEASON 1**

https://preview.redd.it/1fp7x5pyzkk21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18b1834838da9493203847cf412cf5e39dd2d2e4

**Major balance changes:**

* Hit box size reductions and optimizations for Caustic, Pathfinder and Gibraltar
   * We’re better sizing hitboxes to character gear & model
   * Since these adjustments have a MAJOR impact on the game, we want to make sure there aren't any major bugs, so we didn’t want to rush them out
   * If these adjustments prove to be insufficient, we’ll consider additional adjustments during Season 1

&#x200B;

**Minor balance changes:**

* **Caustic**
   * *Traps* \- Reduced cooldown to 25 seconds from 30 seconds
   * *Traps* \- Increased radius and proximity radius by about 10%
   * *Traps* \- Removed a 1 second delay on the smoke dealing damage to players
* **Pathfinder**
   * *Insider Knowledge* \- Increased the number of beacons in the world to 12 from 10
* **Lifeline**
   * *Care Package* \- Removed slight chance that level 4 armor and helmets will drop
* **Wraith**
   * *Into The Void* \- Cooldown increased from 20 -> 25 seconds
* **Bangalore**
   * *Double Time* \- Reduced move speed bonus to 30% from 40%

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**WEAPON BALANCE**

**Disruptor Rounds with Alternator:**

* Reduced Shielded damage multiplier 1.7 -> 1.55.
   * *Designer Notes: Disruptor rounds on the alternator are shredding shields a bit too quickly and still proving to be stronger than intended, so we're reducing the disruptor rounds multiplier on shield damage*.

**RE-45:**

* Increased Magazine Size for all tiers to the following:
   * Base: 16
   * Common: 19
   * Rare: 22
   * Epic: 25
   * *Designer Notes: We’re giving the RE-45 a small boost in power by giving it one more round for every mag size. Downing a non-fortified enemy with the RE-45 with 0, 50, 75, and 100 shields requires 10, 14, 16, and 19 shots respectively, so this extra round gives the gun the ability to one-mag more armored enemies instead of leaving them barely alive.*

**R-301:**

* Increased vertical and horizontal recoil. Slightly increased recoil pattern randomness.
   * *Designer Notes: We’ve made these changes as we’ve seen that the R301 is a bit stronger than intended at long range. We’ve adjusted recoil to balance keeping it effective at medium to close range--which is the original intent--but it should be more difficult for players to auto fire and still laser enemies at long distances.*

**LEGENDS**

**General**

* Made adjustments to Pathfinder’s and Low-Profile Legends hitboxes.
   * Taking shots to the hip now does torso damage instead of leg damage. This should more closely match the behavior of the other Legends.
* Fixed a bug where activating a healing item would cancel the Ultimate for Legends that need to prime it \[Bangalore / Pathfinder / Caustic / Gibraltar / Bloodhound\]
* Fixed an exploit where players would sometimes be able to still shoot while downed.

**Bloodhound**

* Increased the distance that Bloodhound can see traversal clues left by other players \[but not other kinds of clues\] to 25 meters.
* Adjusted the area of effect for Bloodhound’s Tactical to 125 fov.

**Wraith**

* Based on player feedback, we’ve reduced the “hum” audio that’s playing while using Wraith’s Kunai.
* Fixed issue where actions for Wrath would have a slight delay when her weapon is holstered and crouching or sliding while the kunai is equipped.
* Fixed an exploit that allowed players to remove the cooldown for Wraith’s Tactical Ability.

**Mirage**

* Fixed bug where Mirage was able to stay invisible and still be able to shoot and melee when using his Ultimate on a zipline.

**Octane**

* Fixed bug where sometimes Octane’s Jump Pad would not launch the player.",apexlegends,1565716044.0,t3_cpw2nw

"Solo Queuing in Ranked is Not Unfair and Does Not Need Adjustments to make it ""Easier"". Here is Why: The perspective of a part time Solo Queuer on the Ranked System"," 

Can we address the Solo Queue complaints that keep popping up on this subreddit? Too many people here continue to complain about how much harder it is to rank up as a Solo Queue player. Regardless of why a player is Solo Queuing, there is a severe lack of reasoning that goes into the argument that insists Solo Queuing is unfairly difficult. Imagine this scenario: 

* You pull up to a public park that has a basketball court
* The court is playing by the winner stays on rule, so if you win you get to keep playing and the losing team has to get off the court for a new team
* You came to the park solo so you wait for a team to lose and then join the next game with a random team
* You are a decent player and manage to score quite a few points but all 4 of your teammates are really bad and you end up losing because of them
* You get kicked off the court because your team loses
* You wait for the next game to be over and join again with another random team
* This team has one player who is actually decent but unfortunately the other 3 players are even worse than the players from your first team so you get kicked off the court again. 
* After this cycle repeats itself a couple more times, you look around at the neighboring courts and notice the teams that tend to win the most and get kicked off the court the least are all premade teams. These guys arrived at the park together in order to play together
* Noticing this, you realize you must try extra hard to win against these teams and try as hard as you can for the rest of the day
* Despite your best efforts and despite you being an above average player at the park that day, you only end up winning  a fraction of the games the premade squads win by the end of the day
* You realize that unless you are one of the very best basketball players in the world, winning games consistently with random strangers at the park is next to impossible

Now, imagine they recorded the win numbers of each player that day. Depending on how many wins a particular player got, that is how highly a player is ranked on a big bulletin board in front of the basketball courts. You would notice that despite you being better then 75% of players at that park skillswise, you are not in the top 25% in win total for that day. This is because the rankings are based on wins not individual performance and it is much easier to win a team game with a premade team. I would like someone to explain to me how the bulletin board is unfair because it does not account for players playing on a bad team? The ranked system is not flawed because it is harder to play Solo than with a squad. If you want a higher win percentage and as a result a high rank, then you need a premade squad. The ranked system measures team performance over individual performance because it is a TEAM GAME. You obviously need a competent team in order to win more in a team game. Another aspect is the presence of team cohesion or chemistry. Regardless of individual skill level, players that play together consistently will know each other's strengths and weaknesses and win more due to this. 

Reaching a rank without a team will help a player find their maximum individual skill level. However when that player starts to find it near impossible to rank up from that rank, the issue is not with the system at all. The issue is that they are trying to play a team game with random people who are at or below their skill level. It is completely possible to Solo Queue from Rookie to Predator in 1 to 2 weeks if you are individually skilled enough to carry your teammates from Rookie to Diamond. I am currently a hardstuck Gold 1 player who refuses to squad up until I reach Platinum. These Gold games this season are pretty difficult however I am certain that I belong in that rank at the moment. If I was to be placed back into Rookie right now I am confident I could 1v3 or hard carry my way all the way back to Gold regardless of how terrible my teammates are the whole way. Once I hit Gold or more Specifically Gold 2 and 1 my ability to climb will be reduced greatly. What happened? Did the game become unfair all of the sudden? No, I simply am not good enough to hard carry myself and my teammates past Gold 2. After Gold 2 I lack the skills to Solo Queue very well. My goal is to improve enough before the end of the season so that I can Solo Queue to Platinum with ease. Those potatoes in your lobby that are impossible to carry? That is you, you are the potato. Your whole squad is a trio of Solo Queue potatoes getting stomped on by the smarter potatoes playing with their potato friends. 

In conclusion, yes, Solo Players are cannon fodder once they hit their max ranks for the season. Unless you improve massively or play with a premade squad you inevitably become hardstuck at a certain RP threshold. Asking the developers to make it easier to play the game because you insist( for whatever reason) to play a ranked mode in a team game by yourself, logically makes no sense. The game is ranking you based on your ability to win games and for most players that ability tapers off significantly when playing with random people. 

As a quick side note a Solo Queue Gold 3 player is probably better than a Duo Queue stuck at Gold 3. That is partly why it feels so bad to play with duos as a solo. They have chemistry together but tend to be worse skill wise than solo players of the same rank. So if you are Solo Queuing and run into a duo, if they are your rank or lower prepare to carry and try to IGL. If they are a higher rank than you, you have a chance of winning or being carried if you follow their lead.

So can we please, please, please stop this Solo Queue Victimhood Complex? Playing solo is harder but it is not unfair. Every player from the worst to the best player achieves a higher rank when they play with a premade team as opposed to playing solo. Even the top 0.01% of players can rank up easier with a premade squad. Solo Queuing is harder for everyone and you shouldn’t do it period if your main goal is to rank up as fast as possible. As I typed this essay I was watching a guy Solo Queue from Rookie to Predator using only Sniper Rifles the entire time. He is currently Diamond 3 so clearly better players can and will rank up with this new RP system. The purpose of this post is not to rag on solo players who are hard stuck at a certain rank. Rather the message is to remind them it isn’t the games fault they can’t rank up anymore. So you solo queued to Platinum this season? Great! You are a pretty good player! However if you want to hit Diamond this season you either have to become insane at the game or find a few people around your skill level to work together with to achieve that goal.

Since the invention of competitive team based video games there has only been 3 foolproof methods for ranking up. Get carried, get good or get a squad.",apexlegends,1653578467.0,t3_uya0rx
An open letter from the mod team,"Hey everyone,

Recently we’ve seen a lot of controversy over our post removals, rules, and the mod team. Our subreddit has been around for about a month, growing to over 630,000 subscribers and millions of visitors per day - This has not been easy for us. With the thousands of reports we get daily, mistakes are bound to happen. We remove over a thousand posts a day based on user reports and automoderator flags. Our all-volunteer team does their best to make sure that everything we remove is sound and in line with our rules, but as I said before, mistakes happen. Of course, this is no excuse for removing something for the wrong reason or at times, no reason at all. Moving forward, we are reflecting and working on a plan to approach these issues in the future.

Due to our subreddit still being in its infancy, our rules are fluid and a work in progress - we know they are not perfect! A select team of mods will focus on writing, editing, and restructuring our rules to be consistent and fair to promote content that provides constructive discussion.

One of our main goals is keeping everything in line with Reddit rules and policies, such as [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). One such requirement is to avoid witch hunting, which is done quickly on posts reporting users for cheating, cursing, teaming, etc. Due to this being a Reddit policy, we are forced to enforce it with our best judgment. We understand the criticism regarding our stance on cheating posts, but they create an unhealthy environment as evidenced in posts we've seen over the past few days. Reporting these offenses to official platforms that can handle your request (EAC, EA support) and have the ability to take action is more likely to provide a result.

As we have stated before, **no moderator executes an action on behalf of Respawn, EA, or any third party.** We are an all-volunteer force of people who took these positions because we share the same passion for this game as you do. As moderators, one of our primary goals is keeping Reddit free of one-sided topics (echo chambers) and geared toward constructive discussion, positive or negative. Every moderating decision is made by us and not influenced by anyone outside of our team. Does that mean every decision we make is the best one ever? No. We make mistakes because we are human and with such a large community, mistakes are bound to happen. We are always learning how to go about certain things, such as approving a 3rd party giveaway or the removal of a controversial post. All major decisions are voted on by the entire moderation team, ranging from a simple rewording of rules to the approval of a giveaway from a 3rd party (take Razer for example). If you want to learn more about how we work as a team, feel free to message us via modmail or reach out to me (or any other mod) via DM on Discord or Reddit. We don’t want it to look like what we do is influenced by any hidden party and will do whatever it takes to be transparent. We all love this game and want to see nothing but the best for Apex, but most importantly, its community. None of us would be here if we didn’t want to see /r/ApexLegends be the best place to go for Apex Legends. However, we can’t do this without you - The community is what makes this place truly special.

The entire team is open to hearing what you think on our rules, removal policies and the group itself. If you are interested, we are happy to host a moderator AMA. There you can pick our brains about operations and what it’s like building one of the largest subreddits most of us have ever volunteered to run. 

Our primary discussion focus here is reviewing our rules to avoid future confusion and issues, but we can still discuss recent events. Please keep your responses constructive and free of hate, as we want this discussion to be as fluid and helpful to all sides as possible. 

---

**Update:** TalTallon has decided it would be best for the community if he stepped down. We will miss his company and are eternally thankful for the work he did to create this subreddit and discord. No matter what your opinion may be on him, please don't let that overshadow the work he's done to make sure that you have a place to talk about Apex. As mentioned above, we will continue to work on our rules and policies and are open to any constructive feedback you may have.

Level 6 here. Proud of this,,apexlegends,1651333084.0,t3_ufdkx1
I’m one of the players who supposedly ruins pubs.,"Masters badge, 20kills, 4K Badge etc, I have em all. I’m what a lot would consider a sweat, and the object of many people’s complaints when it comes to matchmaking in pubs. 

I get it, it’s not fun to die, lord knows I hate it as much as the next person. But being completely honest, I feel like most of the people who complain about the matchmaking don’t help themselves in games with their bad habits. Let me elaborate. 

I just finished a few games in diamond/master lobbies last night, and decided to play a couple of event matches at the end, the difference in skill is night and day. Some things I saw: 

1. Out of the 90% of engagements I fought in pubs, nobody used cover. Additionally, when sniping, a lot of people stand completely still opening themselves up to headshots. These are simple things that can be fixed and make you better. Your aim is genuinely ok, just move around a bit and peak behind walls and stuff. 

2. People don’t seem to communicate with their squads. I’m a solo but turn my mic on sometimes and ping to let teammates know what’s going on, where we’re going, etc. most of the guys I fight are so disorganised, you can basically just 1v1 people till the squad is wiped.

3. Everyone lands hot. If you want to win and stop dying so quickly, maybe don’t land in highly contested zones. I get it, you want action, but then don’t blame the game for bad matchmaking when it’s just bad positioning. 

4. No need to push everything. This is big, so many people push without thinking, it leaves them open, combining points 1 & 2 leading to death. 

I really don’t think matchmaking is that bad, I just think a lot of people overestimate the skill of diamond/masters players, and get scared when they see the badges for the no reason. Fighting a squad of semi synchronised gold level players is infinitely harder than going up against solo diamonds in my experience.",apexlegends,1705053430.0,t3_194rhof

Y’all need to calm down,"This sub has been nothing but toxicity for almost two weeks over a game. Yes, there have been crashes and bugs but I don’t think any of you realize how difficult they can be to fix. It can be something simple as one extra character in a single line of code out of how many thousands of lines of code that are in the game. And then calling out Respawn and saying they don’t care and we should boycott the game. I can guarantee you that they are working as hard as they can to fix it but you all need to realize that it’s not a simple switch and that these people have lives and families to tend to and can’t work 24/7. They already released a patch which helps but there’s still issues but it shows you that they’re working. On top of that, you have an influx of returning players for the event and heirloom, on top of a massive surge of new players, no wonder their servers can’t hold so many players. They wouldn’t pay for a capacity of 30m players if only 10m play in a day. 

It’s a game. If you can’t play for a day, you’ll survive. Let these people do their jobs and stop terrorizing them because things aren’t perfect.",apexlegends,1632416849.0,t3_ptzryy

We get it,"Those of you who don't want to read the whole thing here's the summary: stop complaining on every post, and stop filling up the sub with the same crap complaint.

Everytime I log onto reddit, the first post is either about trash ranked system or trash matchmaking. GUYS we get it, ranked is the worst mode right now. Every post doesn't have to be about ranked and what crap teammates your matched up with or how your opponents all have 4k 20bomb badges.

Let me just list the issues that you guys have been posting since the start of this season or since last season: 

•trash teammates in ranked 
•trash matchmaking
•trash servers
•Rats
•the occasional ""why can't I party up with someone who's 2 ranks higher than me but can get matched up with randoms of any rank"" 
•my teammates are bots but my opponents have 4k 20 bomb 
•my kd is 1.3 compared to last season where it was 4.5
•what is hidden mmr and why am I going up against masters and preds when I'm still silver
•why are pubs full of sweats?

Most of these issues orginate from ranked, but that doesn't mean every god damn post has to be about an issue. why can't you people just post clips of you mowing down a team or a good 1v1, it's not that hard to stop complaining and play the game or a different game.

God, all I see are complaints over and over again. And sometimes the posts are from these little shits that brag about a 4.5kd but they complain about getting matched with preds?? Make it make sense, no wonder devs don't talk to us anymore, because the majority of you all complain about the same thing like a child throwing a tantrum.

My bad for any good human being that just plays the game and rarely complains, you are amazing players and hopefully get the best teammates and reach pred and somehow find a million dollars in your bank account tmrw.",apexlegends,1692500822.0,t3_15vzrec

Your “trash” ranked team,With everyone talking about how ranked means nothing because of the hidden mmr this season I think it’s the perfect time for self reflection. When you feel like your team mates are useless or are really bad or don’t know how to play the game.. you tell them to never use that legend again and all the other things you say since you are far superior to them. Remember this!!! You are in the same skill level as them!!! You might not want to believe it but that is the reason you are in their lobbies.. so maybe take some time and wonder why you always get “ let down” by the team you are playing with.. is it them ? Is it you? Only your hidden mmr and respawn know for sure,apexlegends,1694634163.0,t3_16hwore

"The Octane Leak is Fake, and Here's Proof","Hey Legends.

Before I get started I wanted to mention how I know this leak is fake. I've been involved in many communities for a long time that constantly gets stuff ""leaked"", the main one being the smash community. I've seen a lot of fake leaks and some of them have even convinced me. With this knowledge, I'm going to explain why Octane is a complete farce, from top to bottom.

#1 ""High Speed Daredevil""

This is more of a nitpick than anything, but none of the legends currently in the game have 3 words in their short description. Only two. This is likely a design choice and wouldn't be overridden on their first post-launch Legend. ""High Speed"" is also incorrect grammar, it would be High-Speed, with the hyphen.

#2 Differences in The Two Leaks (From The Same Guy)

Looking at the original ""Leak"" of Octane [here](https://s3.dexerto.com/articles/octane_leak_1.jpg) and the current moveset leak of Octane [here](https://i.redd.it/nt60ofiaj8j21.jpg). The ones that stick out to me are the lack of the ""green glow"" from his goggles, the pouch on his right that, although could be there, would still appear under the blur, and the lack of any of the wires coming off him. As these seem to be his main defining trait, you'd want to show these in the example model.

#3 Symmetry is Ignored

A very important part of designing legends is symmetry, so it's not easy to tell which direction they're facing at a distance. However, Octane seems to ignore this, with both sides of him being noticeably different.

#4 Nothing to show what his abilities are

Every legend that uses some sort of physical ability has something to show it on their model. Bangalore has her smoke launcher, Pathfinder has a grappling line behind him at all times and Caustic has two large tubes that likely contain his traps. However, not only does Octane have no visual link between him and his abilities, he has meaningless things attached. The coil of wire on the left side of him, for instance, has nothing to do with his ability design, and nothing shows the idea of the ""Jump Pad"" he can throw out.

#5 Black is the new Black

All of the current legends have a large amount of dark colour on their base skin body, in order to help distinguish them in the large number of bright areas in the map. Octane, however, is only dark on his legs/arms/head, while his body is bright white and almost neon green.

#6 Hue shift

His ultimate is literally just a hue shifted version of Mirages. It's that basic.

EDIT: As people seem to be misunderstanding this, let me explain. In photoshop or any other image modifying software, you can change the ""hue"" of an image, moving it along the colour wheel. The colours used in Octane's ultimate are the exact same brightness and contrast as Mirage's, whereas all the other Legends are noticably different (even similarly designed ones, such as Caustics, are different brightness).

#7 Reverse image order

When the images were posted, the first one was Octane being in the character select screen. The second, Octane wasn't unlocked. This would imply that they got uploaded separately, obviously, but the image quality is also drastically different. The one where you need to read the text is high quality, while the other is the ""4chan angle"", where it's taken on a screen at a bad angle. If he's gotten this working at home, why wouldn't he just use the Xbox's built-in screenshot feature as he did for the moveset leak?

#8 The abilities don't mesh with Apex

With the first 8 legends, there was a noticeable attempt to not ""hard counter"" any existing legend. However, Octane's Tactical would go directly against Caustic. His Ultimate also has issues simply because it would do either the same job as a balloon or Pathfinder's Zipline (but only vertically).

#9 ""Battle Pass""

The Battle Pass text, as seen at the top of the image, is horrendously misaligned. Obviously added in post by someone who likely didn't think anyone would look too far into it.

#10 Searching For a Game

This is the kicker for me. In order to connect to the EA servers, you have to get your version checked. If there's a mismatch, you won't be able to search for a game under any circumstances. As this would be the next version of the game, you would never get to the ""Matchmaking"" popup.

So yeah, that's what I personally picked up being wrong with Octane. If you're a youtuber and want to make a video with what I've said here, don't.",apexlegends,1551359906.0,t3_avr199

"Apex Legends ""Celestial Sunrise"" Collection Event: Hardcore Royale, Event Items, Date Night, and more! - Discussion Megathread","[TRAILER HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/10g6kt8/apex_legends_celestial_sunrise_collection_event/)

&#x200B;

Join us in celebrating the dawn of a new year in the Celestial Sunrise Collection Event! We’re introducing a new limited-time mode that will put your skills to the test called Hardcore Royale, and our reward track is packed with great cosmetics to unlock including the new Reactive Peacekeeper! 

&#x200B;

# HARDCORE ROYALE

It’s time to bring your A-Game to the ultimate test of the Apex Games. Hardcore Royale is much like Trios, but with some fun changes that will make information sharing amongst your squad critical. Make sure to count your shots, and always keep the Ring in mind. Let’s break down what to expect when you drop.

[\[Screenshot of hardcore royale\]](https://preview.redd.it/zo5a626r51da1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29e9e1326d3e26a8fe60640a55cb7c45f84dffb)

Armor is restricted to white armor only, and can’t be upgraded through dealing damage, crafting,  or looting. While this makes it easier to take down your enemies, keep in mind you’ll be just as vulnerable. Helmets have also been removed making headshots more lethal/rewarding. Pick your fights carefully, Legend. Or it could all be over in the blink of an eye. Additional gameplay changes for Hardcore Royale are listed below.

Hardcore Royale Changes:

* Limited HUD
* White Armor Only
* No Helmets
* Armor doesn’t spawn in Deathboxes (No Armor Swapping) 
* Ring starts at max Damage

Like Ranked, Hardcore Royale will be LIMITED to Accounts Level 20 and above. So be sure to level up your account before it drops to get in on the intense action. Hardcore Royale will not be a takeover, meaning regular trios will still be available during it’s run. Two more Limited Time Modes will be coming to the Apex Games after the Collection event!

&#x200B;

# CELESTIAL SUNRISE COLLECTION EVENT ITEMS

Unlock 24 enchanting limited-time cosmetics, with Legendary skins for  Octane, Pathfinder, Caustic, Ash and more!

https://reddit.com/link/10g6sap/video/4oi7t6qc61da1/player

All 24 items will be available in exchange for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals and in Celestial Sunrise Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event.

https://reddit.com/link/10g6sap/video/jjbckxod61da1/player

If you unlock them all before the event ends, you’ll automatically receive “Jadeite Retribution”, a new Reactive Peacekeeper Skin!

&#x200B;

# REWARD TRACKER

You can earn up to 1,600 points per day and challenges refresh daily. All these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass so you can complete multiple challenges at once.

# COMING SOON: DATE NIGHT (DUO’S TAKEOVER)

Following the conclusion of Celestial Sunrise on Feb 7th, we're kicking off a fun LTM called Date Night. It’s time to queue up with that special someone and become the Apex Game’s cutest couple. 

Date Night includes a new healing mechanic exclusive to the takeover. Using any healing item will show an area around your Legend. If your Duos partner is in the area when you finish the heal, they’ll also receive the effects of the item! Heal your partner to spread the love, and don’t forget to say thank you!

Date Night also includes a Limited Time Weapon, The Heart Stealer. This is a romantic variant of the Bocek, which heals you a percentage of the damage you do. Just like Healing items; any healing from the bow is also given to your Partner if they’re close by!

L-Star is the best gun in the game (a+ tier at least).,"The DPS in this gun is on par with 301 and the flatline it has 30bullets per CD reload, if you fire in 29bursts or less you never have to reload. Dmg per bullet is 17 (one less than flatline, but shoots faster). The bullet velocity is INSANELY fast like faster than the sentinel and with less drop, not kidding test in firing range on those 500m+ targets. The recoil is easier to control than 301 and flatline if you just practice IMO. The damage you can do while never reloading is insane, I use it for all ranges with 2x-4x sight or 3x, hipfire is better than all other lmgs and ARs imo too. Run a pk or CAR as secondary and you’ll never be beat close range. Far range if you carry enough ammo it’s great too. Plus when you’re barrel stuffing someone while crouch spamming and hip firing you’re blinding them with red flash too. This gun is op. 
(Btw I’m Xbox player who makes diamond with ease and never master yet for context.)

Discussion on the new Ranked-System and a hard truth for all the entitled crybabies...,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5ez1mblt84191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef7a11cc965bc04dff040ea8036d97a65a95322f

I may come off a bit blunt and even ""full of myself"" to the people think ranked should be easier but I still encourage everyone to read my points. I've solo'd to Masters in multiple seasons and think my words hold a bit of weight. 

So the new ranked changes his this season and the majority of the player-base doesn't seem to happy, but here's what everyone needs to know: 

1. **Season 12 spoonfed everyone barring Predators.** If S12 was the first time you hit Diamond/Masters after many grueling seasons, there's a reason why. Respawn decided to shift the RP system to a more placement-based system while simultaneously adding a very low KP-cap (of 5). What did this do? If you compare S12 to S4-S10 side by side, you were basically making over double the RP in S12 than the other ones. ""But a win was still only 200-something, wasn't it?"" Correct. A ""Max-Win"" still netted you roughly the same amount of points as it did in the previous seasons BUT if you had 2-4 kills and a top 2-5 placement, you were making *significantly* more in S12.   
So let's tack on some numbers on a Diamond game.   
We'll say 4th place with 4 KP. Season 12 would give you 67 RP, whereas S8 would have given you 52. Not a huge difference, but still almost 25% less.   
What about 3rd place with 2KP? S12 would have given you 58 RP whereas S8 would have given you 32.   
What about a win with 3 KP? S12 would have given you 152. S8 would have given you 127. Again, not super huge but still roughly 16-17% less.   
**Bottom Line:** It took much less to get much more in S12 than S4-S10. With placement holding more weight in S12 all people had to do was snag a few KP and rat until late game. There was not much incentive to actually frag out.
2. **The majority of players in one lobby** ***should*** **be losing points, not gaining them.** So with the new system a lot of people have realized that your KP doesn't amount to jack unless you hit top 10 and beyond. Now why is this actually a good thing instead of a bad one? Think of it like this: If people who place 1st through 15th were rewarded with RP, even if just a little, ranks would accurately indicate a players skill-level. Why? Because in a system where the majority moves up, everyone will slowly, over time, move up regardless of how good or bad they are. You may not be a Masters-Level player but if you play 5x the games that the average person does, you *will* slowly move up. Why is it better that only the minority of a lobby moves up and that 20th through say, 8th or 7th place lose points? For the exact opposite reason. If only the minority moves up through a single game, it won't matter if they play 2,000 games a split, they still have to hold their own and consistently be at the top in order to move on, so ranks hold a lot more weight with a system like this. In fact, I'd argue that every video game that has a ranked system involving multiple teams should work this way. If 12-13 of the teams get positive points, then everyone will end up hitting masters and there won't be a difference between someone who is actually decent and Chump McGee who just played 2,000 games. 
3. **Solo grinders, barring the best of the best,** ***should not*** **be hitting Masters or Predator.** This is another huge complaint I have seen a dozen times. I won't play the ""oh it's a team game"" card, but I kind of will. I'm not saying that with a lot of dedication and good game sense that someone shouldn't be able to solo to Masters, but what does it say about the state of ranked if more and more people are doing it? Isn't that just a given that it's far too easy? Doesn't it make sense that mostly really good double or triple stacking players are hitting Pred/Masters? Why should this ranked system cater to the people who choose to solo-grind? What exactly entitles these solo-grinders to hitting those ranks? Absolutely nothing. It's a ranked mode for a reason. It's meant to be difficult (and even extremely difficult) to be ranked among the best players in the world. 
4. **You aren't as good as you think you are and it's absolutely fine.** Unfortunately with S12's terrible system a lot of players who hit Diamond/Masters for the first time think they're basically esports players now. The bottom line is, **you're not that good.** I'm not exempting myself here despite having solo'd to Masters in S8 and S10 twice. If, with this new system, I don't make Masters, then it's fine. I'm not going to sit here and cry about how hard ranked is because it isn't easy enough for me to get Masters. Ranked is meant to be difficult. It's meant to have only the best of the best at the top, and I am by no means insane at the game. If you're hitting lower ranks with this new system, it just means that that's where you belong. Work on your own skills to become better. 
5. **Game sense is arguably more important than weapon/legend skills.** Like I said in point 4, I'm by no means an insane player. Those guys on twitch would lay me out 100 times out of a 100, but what I do have going for myself is pretty decent game sense. That is, how to rotate, what buildings/locations to play, when to rotate, what fights to take and not to take, etc. Too many players lack this aspect of their game and wonder why they're hardstuck. With the new system in S13 people are forced to play smarter since they need to hit top 6 or above to get anything resembling decent RP. This is also a good thing because it weeds out players who have neither the skill nor the game-sense to make it that far. If you're dying from 20th place to 8th/9th place a lot, there's a reason why. 

&#x200B;

With all of that said, is the S13 ranked system perfect? Nope, it could use a few tweaks I'm sure. Is it the best, most competitive version of ranked that we've had yet? Absolutely. 

If you're one of the people who have a big gripe with the new system, ask yourself this: What ranks were you hitting from S4 to S11? Was S12 the first time you hit Masters? Don't get defensive and be offended that your S12 Masters badge simply doesn't mean as much as all the other ones. You can blame Respawn for giving you a false sense of where you should be placed. 

If you're finding yourself hardstuck at Gold, Plat or even Diamond this season when you normally hit much higher, it's fine. Again, (and I know I'm a broken record here) it's meant to be hard. You're meant to have to be good at shooting stuff AND using your brain. Adapt to the new system, find out whether you should play for KP late game or get them early, whether you should play zones ASAP or play them slow, which fights you should and shouldn't take, etc. etc.

In-game community. I'm done.,"After playing consistently for 2-3 years and having moved over from Titanfall 2, I can say that I'm done. I'll join to help friends with the battle pass, but that's it. My go-to first-person shooter has already changed to The Finals.

I love the maps, guns, audio (when it works, haha), gameplay, and style. I love the characters and game modes, but I cannot get past the in-game community. The diving off the maps from the dropship, running in 1v3 and instantly quitting, people having mental breakdowns over you picking up a weapon or not reviving them while a team surrounds their down state.

It's hard for me to fathom that fully grown adults can scream like children as you revive them and offer your shield, how you can wipe a team and still have a middle aged man melting down to the point his voice is cracking in insults and ill wishes because he ran in with white shields, low ground, and feels it's your fault. When I first started playing, it wasn't perfect, but I found people still left you a gun on hot drops or at least some ammo, yet I see less and less in-game teamwork.

A while back, I swapped to Mixtape as it was initially a little better than ranked and pubs. People played objectives in Arena and seemed to work together more and that was enjoyable. Now that it has been Mixtape for a while, people don't even try with the objective, clinging desperately to their K/D because God forbid you have fun or help teammates. The funny thing is those people hardly ever touch 10 kills yet hop on the mic in a rage if you dare notify them that the lockdown(lockout?) has begun. Gun run, for the most part, seems to have less insanity at least.

I truly did love this game, but for the sake of my own patience, I have to say goodbye, at least as my daily game. The community has honestly drained the spirit out of this game for me. I wish I were a more patient person and had the energy.  It was funny at first, but now every other game, people are raging, leaving and screaming in the mic like the good ol CoD days (but for some reason that never bothered me). The funny thing is that the younger audience seems to be decently well-mannered, and often it is the adults I run into who cannot emotionally handle being shot at in a video game.

This was also the reason I moved on from Overwatch as it became that way after they focused on being more competitive and going eSports. Perhaps it's related to that, maybe it's streamer influence, I don't know. Maybe people are just unhappy with Respawn or the state of the game. I know there are ragers and griefers in every community, but at this point, at least on the European servers, it's simply too exhausting and I don't enjoy solo dropping as I found a lot of fun in the teamwork.

It  especially hurts to see new players in the Squad and trying to stick up for them when the 3rd is just dumping toxicity on them the whole match, especially when they are doing well. It got to the point I disable voice chat but can still tell because of the behaviour. It's incredibly unnecessary and happens way too often. It's ok to be sweaty but don't make it everyone else's issue or play selfishly because it just harms your own fun and stats while making it a worse experience. People behind the screen are human too, especially beginners and you never know if someone is playing with a disability (like a friend of mine who stopped playing) or having a bad day.

Anyway, complaining more will do no good. I am putting this here for anyone who feels the same, you're not alone. Thanks for reading my vent. Times have otherwise been great, I'll be stopping by in full squads or to help a friend with BPass once in a while but for me I'm done.

***Shoutout to those of you who do try to make Apex a welcoming and fun experience by teaching and being kind in game, I went from horrible at this game to pretty damn good because of people like you. <3  Hope to see you wonderful people in whatever me and my friends get in to next!***

"For the clueless, here is why hot dropping is popular","1. You want to get better at the game and problem solving in tense situation. 

2. You want to get control of your nerves in said tense situations. Calm under pressure is underrated when it comes to apex. When you are nervous, your skill ceiling is reduced significantly

3. Winning the BR means more when you do it while overcoming more obstacles. I.e surviving a hotdrop and winning. Where is the skill in ratting and winning when you only 3rd party one team for the victory?? That is not skill

4. People that really play apex to get better understand the value of hot dropping. Casual players that want to just log in and play for shits and giggles complain about hot dropping.

READ before making another post about the trailer for season 11,"For those who don’t know…the devs had to change animation companies because of the old company’s work policies being insane…to the point that one of their employees committed suicide. Lets honor that man/woman and stop asking for that company to come back. Are you guys seriously complaining about a 4 min trailer? I get being mad at some recent skins and the servers to a degree, but a trailer? C’mon guys its not that serious. 

Best way I can put it is: pick and choose your battles. Whats more important? A trailer or the game itself? Just sayin’
Nothing but love though, just kinda tired of people assuming things and attacking other human beings(the devs) for having to make a moral decision.

Edit: I like how I make a post about honoring a person who killed themselves while trying to animate for us and people are seriously trying to knit pick what I said. I never said the company name and if they are owned by the same parent company that still proves my point…why would apex want to associate with that parent company or any of its smaller companies from within?? Some of you guys are seriously confusing to me. Also if you saw the other posts I was talking about, people literally said the words, “why can’t we go back to the original animators, I guess its so they can save money.”",apexlegends,1634973970.0,t3_qe05ix

Bitching and moaning about some battle pass that Respawn doesn’t even owe you. 

And some people are just hopping on the bandwagon and shit-posting for some free Karma. Here on this sub? Seriously?

You don’t have to buy this BP. I think I will. Because Respawn deserves some money and support. I would “donate” 10 dollars to Respawn.

Yes, objectively, this battle pass could have been better, but cut them some slack. It’s only season 1. Stop be childish and enjoy the game.

Edit: I’m not a nazi. I, too, am actually pretty disappointed by the lack of variety and exciting content to unlock. By all means, speak your mind, but PLEASE be ~constructive~ when posting on this subreddit. These developers deserve so much more respect than dozens of thoughtless posts like “this is lazy” and “fix your battlepass” and other shit that’s just bashing them for trying to make their way in the Battle Royale market. 

Also edit: The BP isn’t even out yet. There could be plenty of stuff that they haven’t announced that hey have in store for the duration of the season. Let’s be civil and just wait and see, alright?

This subreddit has been incredibly toxic and shitty towards the devs and their reaction is completely understandable,"Let's put this into perspective: the devs made an event for us to enjoy. Huge community backlash. Within a few days, devs decided to listen to community feedback and take action. They admitted they messed up and addressed our concerns. They expected players to be thankful that they listened to the feedback and acted appropriately.

Wrong. People continue to insult and berate the devs. Calling them ""money hungry fucks"" and ""clowns"" and ""EA's bitch."" Calling respawn a bunch of idiots for one reason or another. 

Well, respawn snapped. In a moment of weakness (Gamer Rage™), they let loose all the emotions they've been bottling up up for the past 6 months. All those times where they were berated and looked the other way, they finally said **fuck that. How dare the players berate us after we listen to their feedback.**

I mean imagine how infuriating that would be, to be berated after demonstrating that you're willing to listen to criticism and adjust accordingly. 

Now, I'm not justifying their actions or responses. They were unprofessional. But just think for a minute what it's like in their shoes: trying to please the community but facing personal attacks and insults. Dealing with people that act like asshats (yes, don't pretend there aren't asshats in this subreddit). 

The cosmetics store is not perfect. In fact, it is a work in progress. But respawn has shown that they are willing to listen to community feedback. It makes no sense to personally attack the devs over the store when they have just demonstrated that they are willing to listen to the players! Personal attacks should be substituted with civil criticisms. End of story. 

The devs are human, they make mistakes. That doesn't give you the excuse to be toxic. Toxicity just adds gasoline to the fire. That is not what this community needs.",apexlegends,1566229301.0,t3_csisc6

"I will get downvoted into the depths of hell, but you guys are completely over blowing what dko5 said out of proportion.","To put quite simply, I used to enjoy being on this subreddit watching all the different fan art, plays, and the discussion in the daily threads. Now, every single goddamn time I come to this subreddit all I see is not constructive feedback for the devs, but continuous name calling, insults, and people talking about “Respawn being greedy”

Now, onto the supposed insult to the community. Let’s face it, it’s not remotely as bad as you guys make it seem. No, dko5 wasn’t insulting the whole community IMHO, cause some of you (I’m not gonna say names) are very toxic and have made posts about him calling you “asshats” despite that being exactly what SOME of you guys are? He called you out on your bullshit and you couldn’t take it so you revolted and made it even worse than it was.

We can all very well agree the Iron Crown Event was a flop not for them, but for the community. The stuff was overpriced, ridiculous to say the least. And as someone who spends like $20 on this game every 2 or so weeks I can personally say I had money ready for the event, but now I’m spending nothing. I’d much rather have had the option to spend $20 on the Lifeline skin to begin with than have it only accessible through the overpriced loot boxes. They acknowledged it and yes, it doesn’t mean anything for the event, and yes they are still a bit on the greedy side of things. And I understand they are a business, and to keep the lights on, it’s expensive. My dad works on mobile applications and games and he makes $120K a year give or take. Development is expensive, and its difficult to break even let alone profit. You have to look at it from perspective, which isn’t being done here. You see it as them being greedy without thinking that maybe they need money to continue to work on the game? I’m sure we’d all love to live in a world where everything is free but given the game is free that’s not possible. Perhaps they should just give you more for the money? Idk, but change is needed.

Why I'm leaving this sub - a reaction to the Iron Crown drama,"I've been playing Apex for 5-6 months now, and the sub's reaction particularly to the devs over the past few days has sickened me.  Devs are real people, with real lives, who are probably passionate about what they do - these are the actual game developers, not the marketing or social media managers.  These are the people who built and sustain the game.  Viciously shitting all over them non-constructively does absolutely no good.  These are not celebrities, it's not their job to be in the public eye, they choose to do so because I imagine they want to directly get user feedback to improve the game, and you are all squandering it.  Imagine if you made a mistake at your job, or people weren't pleased with how you performed your duties, and you were endlessly berated for days or weeks with zero recourse.  Now imagine it wasn't just any job, but your most special project, your pride and joy that you poured your heart, time and energy into making it the best you possibly could.  How would that make you feel?

I keep seeing the argument that the only thing that's changed with game development is that major corporations are now huge multi-million dollar or billion dollar companies and just want to squeeze every last cent out of consumers.  I've been PC gaming for over 25 years, and more than that has changed.  A couple decades ago, there was no continuous/active development of games before or after release.  There was no such thing as 'early access' or microtransactions, because the way games were developed it would not allow those concepts.  You paid for a full game, and that's all you got unless there was a patch, DLC, or some kind of mod kit to change game behavior.  Games like Baldur's Gate were a one-time buy - there was no skins or other MTX to purchase.  Game developers did not have social media accounts and social media by and large was just dedicated forums or chat rooms like mIRC.  There was no constant wave of social interaction through mediums like reddit and twitter.  Context is important and you can't just cherry pick one or two things that support your argument.

Apex Legends is a full game that you do not have to pay for.  It gets updates and improvements, which you also do not have to pay for.  You can unlock content in the game without paying for it.  I've spent all of $5 on the game to the first battlepass, which earned me enough currency for the next BP to be free.  I haven't bought any MTX because I'm not really interested in cosmetic transactions.  Since I've started playing Apex, Respawn has released multiple new characters and improved aspects of the game based on user feedback, such as adding Ranked mode and kill cams without me paying a cent.  20 years ago, those types of improvements would be paid expansions, community-created mods, or \*maybe\* patches if they were able to introduce new content via a patch.

Personally, I'm extremely happy with the direction Apex has taken.  I'm sure I'm not the only one.  I understand how everyone is frustrated not just with Respawn, but huge corporations like EA exhibiting exploitative tactics via lootbox type systems.  We should \*constructively\* push back against the industry to steer them away from continuing these practices.  But the reality is, Apex isn't the only game using this method to earn money.   I hope you all take a serious look in the mirror and rethink your approach on how you express your frustration for these practices, because right now it's incredibly toxic.",apexlegends,1566092549.0,t3_crv4io

Thank you Respawn for ignoring us here on Reddit,"And that is not sarcasm. I really hope the team in the studio reads this. I don’t care if you want to down vote this post or come and tell me I’m a Apex fan boy.  Whatever.

Respawn, 
Thank you for sticking to your guns about your development cycle, and how frequently you have updated this game. Yes the community here on Reddit is in an uproar about a “broken” game, and they point their fingers at you demanding more content in shorter cycles. The gaming community has become largely about instant gratification, and no one seems to care about the health of a long term game, until we look back and realize 5 years later we are still playing the same game and have fallen in love with it (see: TitanFall).  

There are people like me who roll their eyes when people shout “broken game.”  People like me understand that a broke game is something that actually breaks how the game is meant to be played (ie you can only win with pathfinder, you’re at a serious disadvantage if you DONT pick X gun, none of which is the case).

There are people like me that put their head down and duck and quietly go on enjoying the game when others are flinging insults your way about the lack of content. Some of us have played games where there was plenty of content but seriously flawed/broken mechanics, yet the studio cared more about monetizing the game than about the health of the game. Thank you for not being that kind of studio. 

There are  those of us who quietly appreciate your game and would rather not even participate in the discussion bc the idea that this game is “BAD” or “BROKEN” or “needs more content NOW” is so ridiculous, it would be like getting into a discussion about the shape of earth with a flat earther.  

We love your game. We voice our opinion with a controller in our hand, a mic to our mouth, and expletives to the squad that just third partied us. Then we laugh, push triangle and jump right back in.",apexlegends,1558024839.0,t3_bpety7
This is the worst update this game has ever gotten.,"**Havoc and Devotion:**

**Devotion** was dropped from 44 bullets to 36, this is fine considering how stupid this gun could be just left clicking.

**Havoc** was dropped from 32 to 24. What in the *actual* fuck kind of drugs is Respawn on? Havoc now can't go past 24 bullets, REQUIRES A LEGENDARY HOPUP TO FUNCTION LATE GAME, can only stack 60 rounds and there's literally 0 reason to take it over an R301 now (which is an easier to use gun \[no recoil\], has easier to find ammo and can get 28 bullets.)

**THIS IS A BUG BUT RAISES CONCERN THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT NERFING HAVOC.**

**CFG**

You can no longer edit Source engine. Kinda lame considering how bad the muzzle flash is and there's also other things that you could edit that were simply QoL. At least they've answered that they weren't allowed muzzle flash removal/reduction (even though so many people editing their config should raise concern that maybe Respawn is wrong here)   

Also ANYONE could take 30 seconds to edit their cfg, it wasn't an exploit and it wasn't an advantage because it was readily available to ALL players. Its no ones fault if they didn't want to change their CFG.   

Also capped FPS isn't working anymore which is adding huge input lag with FPS variations because this game is optimized like shit and you can go from 110 to 170 by turning 90 degrees.

**BHOP Healing Removed.**

Why? Because bad players complained that good players were outplaying them because they actually care?

I truly don't understand the decision to remove bunny hop healing. Also no, its not a fucking exploit.

When you remove skill ceiling from a game, especially a PVP game, you reduce the lifespan of a competitive players' interest in the game. Things like bunny hop healing in this game, Smash Combos, Riven animation cancels etc are all things that add skill ceiling to their respective games and keeps players engaged.

Why do you think all the most popular champions in LoL (the biggest game in the world) are difficult champions? Its because learning is FUN. They like to CHALLENGE themselves. If you put 100 hours into a champion you should smash someone with 5 hours on that champion but removing skill ceiling lessens that which makes no sense to me.

If you play Fortnite for 250 hours you're gonna smash a new player. Thats what skill ceiling is. It makes you **invest time**  and in exchange you **improve.**

Good luck having a competitive future Apex.

**Hipfire while sliding removed/reduced.**

If you try and hipfire while sliding down a hill  your hipfire will just be trash.

[Example.](https://clips.twitch.tv/CourageousPrettyPuppyBloodTrail)

**DEATHBOXES**

Why'd you have to change the entire deathbox layout? Were you really that lazy that instead of fixing the Gear section you just deleted it and mushed everything together? Yikes.

These are just the things I can think of but man holy fuck this patch feels bad. It had good changes for sure but at what cost? The game feels like shit now. The main selling point of Apex that it had extremely fluid and fast paced gameplay but...what does it have now? Its just a BR shooter.",apexlegends,1559690712.0,t3_bwvnkc
A love letter to Respawn from a trans girl,"In all the years of video games I have experienced, I have played numerous characters. I created countless ones, and loved many more. But something had always been missing for me, though I had never known it until a certain, recent moment.

When I first came to Apex, a month or so after the game launched, I was skeptical. Another battle royale, jumping on the bandwagon of the trend. But I quickly found that it was so much more, and just right for me; a game full of lively, bright, interesting characters, all such vivid and unique instances of human. I fell in love in no time at all. Wraith was my first main, and I adore her to no end. I was so happy playing this game and playing her in particular that I very readily bought loot box after loot box, seeking her kunai. My beloved first heirloom, that I was so, SO excited to finally get. I still treasure it to this day, even despite that I don’t play her very often anymore.

When Valkyrie was released, I finally had a second character I really enjoyed playing and representing myself with. For a while, I swapped back and forth between her and Wraith as my mains, enjoying the variance of having two characters I felt comfortable projecting myself into. It was nice, and the game felt refreshed and new in a very good way.

When Ash was released, I’d found a new main that I enjoyed far and away more than the others before. I had been gone from the game for some time but came back into it with no hesitation to play her. Wraith and Valkyrie were a joy for me, but Ash was more. I’ve always loved sci-fi tech, cybernetics in particular, and the idea of being a fully synthetic human has always been so fascinating to me. Playing as Ash was a wholly new experience for me, this fictional person that is, in entirety, a concept I have loved daydreaming about for so long.

With Ash, I felt myself grow closer to a character than almost any others I had before, a virtual body that I felt so deeply comfortable inhabiting that she was near to a second skin to me. But now, a different, deeper feeling has taken root.

In all my years of gaming, characters have been everything to me. But as I grew up some and had a very important realization, that I’m a girl and not a boy, characters that share this trait have been few and far between. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been more than happy to see representation for people like me grow over time, with characters becoming more and more common as well as ever more prominent, and the character customization options expanding to include us. But I had never had the opportunity to play a character who shared that enough. I could create a character that was trans to me, sure, but the characters were never written that way, it was never implicit. Trans in body but not in spirit and speech.

Until Catalyst.

Being so bonded to Ash, I figured I might just try out Catalyst a bit to see how it felt. But playing her for the first time, it was like something clicked, suddenly felt more right than ever before. Using her as my digital avatar made sense to me so clearly that it made me cry. Finally, FINALLY, a character that represents me in mind, body, and soul, and I get to be her! I love her! I love every bit about her, her style, her attitude, her presence, her voice, her abilities, ... She is so powerful. She is just so many things I have always wanted to become, and some that I have already fought to achieve. It just feels right, so right, like nothing else, to play someone who is so much the things that I am now and things I am growing to become. It’s hard not to keep repeating that fact, how right it feels, to really get it across because it’s so difficult to articulate just how meaningful and emotional an experience that playing a character like Catalyst is to me. 

She’s unafraid. She’s loud. She isn’t hiding who she is from anyone, and I feel so empowered pretending to be her for just a while. I’ve had such a hard time with presenting myself as who I really am to people, but playing her makes me feel like I’m unstoppable. Invincible. Made of iron! It’s such a moving experience for me that I already feel more comfortable in my own skin, emboldened and more confident. I believe in myself that much more and it just warms my heart.

Thank you, Respawn. Thank you so, so much for giving me this experience. I may have all these words but none of them can really describe what this experience has done for me, and it’s only just begun! I’ve barely even scratched the surface of my experience with Catalyst, and I’m already in such bliss! Thank you all, for all you do and all your hard work. Thank you, from the bottom of the heart of this one little trans girl, who you’ve just given the best present ever! And it’s measurably helping me on my journey as a growing trans woman, too. And now, thanks to you, a growing trans witch! <3",apexlegends,1667465410.0,t3_ykwkmt
"Console pleb here. Nerf aim assist, I'm ready for the hate.","TLDR; VERY UNPOPULAR OPINION, don't kill me in the comments. Nerf aim assist even on console. Coming from a console only player.

I only play apex on console, so I don't get to participate in the MNK VS ROLLER debates that you see every 2 minutes. That being said, I still support nerfing aim assist across the board. On PC, you have skill gaps when it comes to movement as an example. On console you don't really have any crazy movement tech or anything. Even in master lobbies you hardly see people hitting a wall bounce. The biggest skill gap on console is your aim, but with aim assist, the skill gap isn't that impressive. If you're truly a good player on console, you'd want them to nerf aim assist, let the skill gap widen a little more. Your ability to control recoil and track moving targets will shine more. 

I know this is going to get down voted to fucking hell, the average dad of 12 doesn't want the skill gap any higher. We've all been killed by someone, and you spectate them and you're just sitting there like how tf did this absolute bot just kill me. Their skill did like 25% of the work, aim assist did the other 75%. 

Most importantly it's just a crutch. Aim assist should still exist, just way way less strong. Bf2042 aim assist basically didn't work for 2 years, and you still don't get aim assist against bots, yet you can still get kills. You just need to practice and get good. 

I get tired of MnK players crying about aim assist all the time, but like I said I only play console so I don't have a clue what that's like. Yet I still am all for nerfing aim assist across the board.

Let’s be honest here Respawn is that kid that never does his homework until the last minute,They’re not constantly patching the game and should have events like this planned out for weeks. The problems that came up should have been worked out days ago. I’ll bet anything that they came in this morning and tested it for the first time and realized it wasn’t going to work. If they want this game to thrive they need to be more proactive.,apexlegends,1559674276.0,t3_bwsfbb

"Dear /r/apexlegends, we should get a grip. Open Letter to Reddit, Mods & Respawn.","*Before I start off, this is going to be a long one.* ***If you do not have time on your hands, that is completely understandable***\*, I just hope you will not downvote out of spite because it's long. If you do have the time to read, I hope you don't skip parts, as this is coming from my heart!\* ***I do know that I am talking for myself and nobody else***\*, but maybe we do share the same opinion on some topics.\*

&#x200B;

~~This topic is best read while listening to~~ [~~Interstellar's Main Theme~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDVtMYqUAyw) \- *Jk, seriously tho, you're in for a long read.*

&#x200B;

Hello my Legends & Respawn.

# 1) Nobody but us is ""destroying"" the game.

~~And Respawn with their bamboozling :p ( just kidding! )~~

&#x200B;

Destroying is a harsh word and overexaggerated, of course. Also, we're a small vocal minority that has too much time on their hands, let's be honest. We are 680.000 potential players on /r/apexlegends, which is about 1.35% of the entire playerbase. **But**, Reddit is a social site and we do hit the frontpage with a couple of posts too, **which has somewhat of an influence about the game's overall state, or public perception**.

&#x200B;

So how are we, let's call it ""maybe stopping new players to join?""

&#x200B;

Let's start with the biggest issue, Cheaters.

&#x200B;

# 2) Cheaters

Of course there are some, there is **no denying** that, I would like to adress all three parts here, **us, the mods and Respawn.**

&#x200B;

* ***CHEATERS @*** /r/apexlegends

I know you're upset you lost out on  a win due to some cheaters. I am sad that cheating is a common gaming culture in China, and very sorry for our ""honest"" friends over there. I am sorry cheating exists in the first place and all of us have to suffer, some people more, some people less.But, without trying to sound too cocky, I bet some of you are just rage-induced after being killed by one that the first thing you do is to clip, render, upload it, then visit /r/apexlegends and post on here to complain. Which is completely fine and understandable, I just hope that you do also visit the official cheater submit request and report them there aswell, because only posting it on Reddit is going to do nothing to them. You get to vent, which is fine, you get to find some ""kind souls that share your pain"" because they got hacked on too, but it's not helping the game, it's making it worse. What do you think a new player is going to see if they sort by new in this reddit because they're interested in the game? A lot of people check up on the subreddit status before they get into a game, even if it's free. You're just scaring potential new players away, because they think all there is going on is hacking.

&#x200B;

I would like to appeal to calm your rage a bit, I do understand you, but please submit it to the cheater reports page first.

&#x200B;

[https://www.easy.ac/en-us/support/apexlegends/contact/report/](https://www.easy.ac/en-us/support/apexlegends/contact/report/)

*Just write a detailed report and include a link to the video.*

&#x200B;

* ***CHEATERS @ MOD TEAM***

~~I am unsure if I understood the new rules completely, that we will not be allowed to post cheater ""evidence"" with their name displayed as this might start a ""witchhunt"". In all fairness, this is~~ **~~bullshit,~~** ~~should it be so. Removing posts of 101% confirmed or obvious aimbotters or speedhackers, ( ESP is always fishy to tell ) is just helping them get away, should the posts be censored. Again, this point only stands if I misunderstood the rules.~~

~~Secondly, if a person has proof over somebody cheating, they should be fully allowed to post their name, and it is not a witch hunt, this would be just defending the cheater. Let it be there, uncensored, let him get his public shame, many many even ""bigger streamers"" have been found cheating that way. However, the rage induced titles need to stop, I propose following:~~

&#x200B;

~~- Reporting cheaters only with clear video evidence is allowed on Reddit~~

~~-~~ **~~These will not be treated as a witch hunt~~** ~~as the person in question is a human piece of you know what.~~

~~- All ""Cheater Caught"" Submissions should have a specific title, as in ""Name, Date, caugh ""cheat in question"".~~

~~- Respawn should get involved into these user submitted reports on Reddit, as they make nowhere absolutely clear on ease where and how to report them, even I had to google -~~ **~~as long as they have a constructive, informative title.~~**

~~- This will help push out specific bans for individual cheaters~~

~~- Introduce a personal flair for ""Cheater Submission""~~

&#x200B;

*~~which leads us to our last member,~~*

&#x200B;

* ***CHEATERS @ RESPAWN***

Let me start off that I am very upset by you not battling speedhacks. ESP and Aimbot can be very hard to detect, wether it's you, EAC, BattlEye, you name it, yes. But that you do not have an in-house protection ( I know jumping from dropship can be buggy, so make it start 1 minute into the match ) **that flags people that travel more than ""x"" distance possible in ""y"" time** is just *laughable*, I will not defend you here, at all.

In terms of the other cheats such as aimbot and wallhacks, I do understand how cheating works.

I do know that you can not ban them instantly, because that will give the cheaters the upper hand, because they will instantly know what caught them, what they did wrong, this is why we banwave in the first place, make them guess over a period of say 2-3 weeks, they can't pinpoint their ""leak"" as fast as if you would instantly ban. However, instantly banning user reported specific submissions as here on Reddit or the EAC site, is completely fine, because they got caught red handed and were blatant. And yes, sadly every piece of code made by human is able to be reverse-engineered at some point.

&#x200B;

**~~I just hope that you can spend some resources into Reddit for checking on user submitted reports on here aswell, as long as they're informatively distributed and manually push those bans out. If not, I'd like to request a statement from you as in why not. Maybe you can find a way to work with the reddit mods as in how to submit cheaters here, altough it should obviously not become the focus point - and there is cheaters, you denying that or not allowing cheater submissions on reddit even those this is fan-based run, just developer supported, would be straight up manipulating evidence.~~**

&#x200B;

**@Reddit**

*( for the people that don't understand why we have banwaves and not instant bans, as I said above, say you update your cheat and it gets detected the very next day, they will know where the problem is, take it down, rework it, put it back up. Boom, 1 day cheater free gameplay. However if you do it in 2-3 weekly banwaves, they will have to pinpoint the issue, they will be forced to look through the stuff and ask themselfes: ""What got us caught? It was running fine for two weeks"" and they will take their cheat down for a longer period of time, sometimes even up to two weeks. So what do you prefer, 1 day without cheaters, or weeks without cheaters? )*

&#x200B;

# 3) Crashes, Bugs, Communication, Fixes and Quality of Life Improvements

~~also called CBCF & Q, fancy shortening, eh?~~

&#x200B;

* **CBCF & Q @ ""** /r/apexlegends **""**

&#x200B;

We all have issues. Some more, some less.

We all feel you, if you crash, if you die to a certain bug, if anything happens.

But I'd like to remind you, wording is key. The way 70% of the sub posts issues, is not constructive, it's just pure hate.

Please keep in mind that you are more likely to be heard, by the community and the devs, if you post constructive criticism. We all know there's CTD's with no errors and other stuff. But if you keep raging about it, as mentioned way above, it'll make us only look bad. If you crash or want to go on a rant on reddit, please take your time and first post to the official bug reports for Apex Legends found here:

&#x200B;

[https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/bd-p/apex-legends-bug-reports-en](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/bd-p/apex-legends-bug-reports-en)

&#x200B;

and then post to Reddit to maybe make others more aware.

We know there are still CTD's without errors, but this won't help them getting fixed faster, same as calling Respawn out with things like ""So you push out legends and skins but don't care about crashes?""

**No. There is different teams working in different departements. A visual designer will have nothing to do with you crashing to the desktop. They won't pull their landscape artist off the new map ( hypothetically ) to grab a coffee and give his opinion to the programmer trying to fix a certain part of a code.**

Respawn already said multiple times that they're working on it, anyone denying that is just rage-induced at the moment and should calm down.

Try to the see the other side, always. If I held a pillow infront of you, you see it's only black on the side you see, do you say ""This pillow is black, I am in the right and 100% correct""? Or do you say **""I do see the pillow is black on my side, but IT COULD BE that the pillow does have another color on the other side.""** Always try to see both sides. Bugs in the game is not easy for us NOR for them. If we're unhappy, the devs are unhappy aswell, don't act like they're not. We're all gamers in the end.

&#x200B;

I will now post a list of known issues and other stuff that /r/apexlegends calls out to for more visibility for the devs, all summed up in one thread, just in case this gets visibility. **If I forgot anything, please let me know in the comments.**

&#x200B;

**MOST KNOWN GAMEBREAKING ISSUES:**

&#x200B;

* Random Crash to Desktop with no warning.
* Random Crash to Desktop with ""x"" warning.
* High Framerate ( 2000+ ) in the Intro, causing some GPU's to act up and crash the Driver.
* Slowmotion for 1-5 minutes after dropping from the ship in certain lobbies.
* Deathboxes having collision and causing unecessary bugs.
* People dying instantly instead of getting downed altough teammates are still alive.
* While using Bloodhounds Ult, and going into the ""Healing Wheel"" Icons are not displayed.
* The ""Healing Wheel"" doesn't show icons under normal circumstances aswell.
* Ultimates are instantly activated on Ziplines for most Champions.
* Zipline dismounting you randomly
* Peacekeeper gets locked into 0 Bullets after reload, or not shooting at all. Has to be dropped and re-equipped.

&#x200B;

**QUALITY OF LIFE SUGGESTIONS BY USERS:**

&#x200B;

* Toggle / Hold Sprint Availability ( this is my personal one )
* ""Dead Teammate"" Icon too visible while ADS - Opacity Slider would be nice.
* be able to use Ultimate Accelerants while they're in your inventory with the "" Y / Z "" button.

&#x200B;

*( I really lost track of all the quality of life suggestions ( or I do have a blackout atm. ) that have been posted on reddit here multiple times, please* /r/apexlegends *help me out so I can expand this list )*

&#x200B;

~~Oh yea: letting people bite enemies ankles if too close when downed.~~

~~Jk, make it happen.~~

&#x200B;

* **CBCF & Q @ ""RESPAWN""**

You do post in reddit certain updates, so you're active here. Somewhat. No denying that.

Here's a little tip from a wannabe developer ( I mostly develop stuff I'd rather never talk about, it usually ends up me going back to baking cakes ) but here's the thing: You do know what cannot be done?

&#x200B;

Instant Fixes of Crashes / Issues.

**No way denying that, completely understandable**, tackling an issue, getting down to the root, fixing it, publishing & pushing it live takes time. Everybody ( especially you, Reddit ) should be aware of that.

*You do know what else is instantly possible tho?*

# COMMUNICATION.

You would be amazed how many minds you could put at ease with a simple sentence.

*""Yes, we are aware and we're working on it""*. But this is for the most people too vague, same as the **""soon****^(TM)****""**

&#x200B;

Please, Respawn, consider to uphold your promise of communicational activity that you promised the entire playerbase in the start. Yes, we are aware such a massive rocket launch can be overwhelming. A short sentence or tweet or any kind of statement goes a long way and puts tons of players at ease. Of course, not everyone is active on Reddit 24/7 so you still see the questions pop up mutliple times, but I did realize one thing after you said that nVidia and AMD was in your house related to the no error CTD's, a lot of people made other people aware and linked your comment / statement that you're actively working on it. This is the 99 monkey effect. Word will spread fast, and then after your statement, players will link your answer to other players who are upset and maybe calm them down too.

&#x200B;

You are a great Dev Team, hands down. I sadly never played Titanfall or Titanfall 2, but everytime that game came up in a discussion or in a streamer's stream, it was only good words.. It was just praising and loving all around. I sincerely hope that you will put more resources into communication with your playerbase, be it reddit, be it Twitter, hell be it you jumping into Random Apex Matches and letting them know just for a little fun ( Jk, I am trying to downplay the situation here a bit ) but you get my point: Communication is key, and yes, this is a Free to Play Title which I believe all of us are grateful for, but you are better than ""soonTM"". You guys are amazing and I'd love to see you fix your transparency issue.

&#x200B;

**Sometimes, honesty is a better way than being vague.**

&#x200B;

* **CBCF & Q @ ""MODS""**

This is a little sidenote from me, not much we can really say or do here, how about you put another sticky up with certified Developer Responses, just make a compilation of ""x"" issue they're aware of and put a statement towards? Maybe it'll help clean up the confusion and miscommunication in this subreddit.

&#x200B;

# 4) WE ARE APEX

~~Put the Interstellar Theme on now, if you haven't above.~~

&#x200B;

We're one community. We all do love the game. Some of you don't anymore and that's okay. But the people here, putting effort into the posts, doesn't matter if it's a bug report, if it's somebody complaining about cheaters, it does not matter if it's a post about the Mozambique or any other meme, or a gif, or a video clip. You could get annoyed by the amount of videos are there, but guess what? Why did the person share the video, the bug report, the rant in the first place? **Because they care**. And we all should care. Their video was their highlight of the day / week. They laughed hysterically, they shared joy and wanted to share it with more. They were proud at the meme or kill they made. And you should not take that away. We're one community, who plays at least this game together. Many of us have met in-game without even knowing.

We should hold together, be friendly, act more constructively, share more joy and give Apex the name it deserves. Because while yes, a game can't fail, only developers can ( my favourite quoute in a life time ) - the playerbase is what makes the game great in the end. Doesn't matter if it's in the EA Forums, or Twitter or Youtube or Twitch or Reddit.

Everybody counts.

Everybody.

&#x200B;

Allfather, bless us with many good patches and content to come,

give Respawn and their players rides of joy, day for day.

&#x200B;

This will get downvoted but I kind of respect the devs for being real with us about how they feel.,"I was explaining to my dad everything that had been happening with this game including the event, the communities backlash, and now the responses from the developers. He is an unbiased opinion on the matter and his response to me after I explained that it’s ridiculous and they can’t do this was, “well they did just do it haha.” Then he explained that from his view, we love this game, it’s free, they are in the business of making money and once I explained that the cosmetics don’t grant any competitive advantage he was even more adamant that we are all sort of being cry-babies about this and he likes that the devs called it like it was.

After speaking with him I almost agree completely. This community, (including myself if you look at my last post) really have been dicks and ass-hats about it. This isn’t to justify the way they monetized everything, the absurd way they did it, and the fact that what they did sort of felt like a slap in the face, but they can kind of do whatever they want.

I also saw a post that reminded me of something important, Reddit is not the end all be all of the gaming community for any game, apex included. Obviously the reddit community gives a lot of great feedback and useful ideas, but ultimately we really are a small fraction of the grand scheme of this game. The majority of my friends don’t even really know what reddit is, nor do they even care or know about this whole fiasco going on with the game and this community. 

I would dare say that the vast majority that play this game and enjoy it probably saw the new event thought, “oh cool a new event, new game mode, and a ton of new skins, awesome!” They probably then subsequently came to the realization of how this event works realized they weren’t going to get many cosmetics without spending money then made the decision whether or not they wanted to spend days money and continued playing happily. 

In conclusion, I don’t personally like the store setup for this event, I would have been happy to spend $20-$40 for everything, but they fact that I’m not going to spend ~$200 for all the event offers doesn’t bother me. I still love playing this game, I find the devs responses comical and honest and believe they have just as much of a right to voice their honest opinion as well professional or not. I’m going to keep playing this game and hope I can get some badass cosmetics in the future for less money/by grinding for them.",apexlegends,1566148042.0,t3_cs3vu3

"Rank reset for dashboarding is a bad move and not a ""punishment""","Regardless of popular belief and request from the reddit community on this, doing a rank reset on people who dashboard is the wrong way about it.

Problem I see in diamond is that it is diamond/predator skilled players who actually do it and to get to predator from diamond 4 still requires some what of skill. As you still need to gain the points to go up. People who say ""lol just camp to placement"" they're either not in diamond or have way to much time on their hands. 

All we would be doing is removing these players throwing them back into bronze 4 and they'll literally be loving the game even more, like pre season 1 matchmaking all over again. Perfect right?

Sure there are people who gained these ranks with basically no skill and camping.

My suggestion is to leave them there and give them no rewards , with the exploit fixed and these players not being able to move anywhere in ranked, constantly being killed by better players. With no rank decreases constantly stuck in the place they were dashboarding to get out of. The enjoyment of the game will soon leave their souls.

Flinch doesn't belong in a bullet sponge game like apex,"Who decided that adding flinch when you get shot was a good idea in a comp shooter??? I literally just lost a fight and realized what was happening, every shot that hit me literally pulled me off the target and as I was 1 or two bullets from downing them, I die... I shouldn't lose a gunfight due to severe flinch in a competitive shooter. I know it's in a decent amount of shooters but my god, it's fucking terrible on apex...",apexlegends,1696816487.0,t3_173g7d7
I literally JUST beat TSM's pro team 3 stack in Ranked to get to masters...im ecstatic right now...,"I literally CAN NOT fucking believe it bro...my friends aren't gonna believe it either 😂... 

So I had failed my masters trials like 50+ times already, to the point where I had 10 attempts to get it, and failed still so I had to gain 50 rp to try again...so i did that, right?... 

I hop on, and immediately invite my duo who were also on... 

Me and one bud were both doing our promos to masters, he had 9 attempts and I had 10...

After 9 CLOSE ASS games (every single one ended in top 5, and a few were top 3) my bro got mad and said fuck this it's 3am, I'm getting off...ok koo...so I have one more try...why not just solo queue right? I'm probably going to fail and try tomorrow, might as well just do it and start fresh the next day... 

So I queue up, find a game, and guess who the champions are? TSM ImperialHal, TSM EvanVerhulst, and some other TSM guy who's full name I didn't catch... 

I immediately said ""welp, so much for winning this one..."", and the wave of defeat started washing over me before the game even started...but I just went with it...

My teammates were good 😁 FINALLY! Me and the Bangalore I got were roughly the same skill level, but the horizon on our team was just fucking CRACKED! 

Long story short we just followed the horizon and supported him 😊 I played conduit and kept everyone in fighting shape, we killed a couple teams on the way to top 5, and in the final end zone we had an insane height advantage... 

The circle closed all the way, we hopped off the roof, and finished up the last 2 squads (who were already kinda weak) for the W 😃😃😃... 

Im so fucking hype that my phone died while writing this and I lost it all, but I literally HAD to share this so I typed it all again 😂... 

Lucky (the horizons name), if you somehow see this, please confirm this story in the comments because I know no one is going to believe this shit 😭 and thank you bro! You are the fucking goat! Already told you that like 10x, but just gotta say it again! 🤣 Your name is very fitting because I would've never imagined I would beat TSM to get to masters rank...WHILE SOLO QUEUING...im still just in shock...

Edit: Also played a few lottery tickets for obvious reasons...(not joking 😂)...

Edit 2: Really this post is just to say, if you're having trouble with promos, and you're really fucking close to the rank you want, don't give up on yourself! YOU CAN DO IT!

Lol like I said it took me 50+ tries until I got lucky, so if you already put in the time and you want to rank up in the hardest season, just bang your head against the wall doing promos over and over and I promise eventually you'll get it...

It's torture tbh...getting so many 2nd and 3rd place games just to fail the promos...but once you get it, it's a high that makes every second worth it...

Edit 3: 🥲 toxic assholes are the reason I don't use this sub really at all...thnx alot guys...cant even be happy about a win...ive made 3 or 4 post in here EVER and now I'm clout chasing 😂 ok... ",apexlegends,1705568798.0,t3_199lym0
Rank does not need a rework and you all need to stop COMPLAINING!!,"Can all of you shut the f up!! Jesus. Ranked it PERFECT this is the exact change it needed. 

All of you complaining about not getting enough RP in bronze/silver there’s two reasons:

- It’s the beginning of a new split and everyone was reset 2.5 divisions instead of the normal 1.5 so essentially you’re still facing the same players you were before at a normal rank. Give it a week and it’ll be back to normal. 

-YOU LOST. Straight up that’s it YOU LOST most of you complaining post your after match report showing you placed 14/20 with 8 kills. BRO ITS A BR AND YOU WERE 6TH GET ELIMINATED THATS A LOSS! 

This new system is perfect after placing in 10th or above your KP is worth significantly more because well you sorta kinda had a win or played a decent game. You did better than 50% All of you complaining about it need to go play pubs and just shut up already. You guys were everything that was wrong with ranked and hopefully this change will drive you all out.

more than 50% of American Pros are now using controller,"More than 50% of pros are now using aim assist, the actual pred list has been controller dominated for years now, lord knows what % of master players are using roller too. 

It's not really deniable anymore, there is a clear advantage provided by aim assist which trumps all the other advantages on MnK, long range tracking and aim, better movement etc simply can't compete with how dominant controller makes users in close quarters fighting. 

The fact so many lifetime MnK players at elite level have now switched to roller shows that where players of equal skill fight, the player with aim assist will win much more often than not, even though these guys have crazy long range aim it's not enough to compensate, controller is just 100% better due to aim assist.

Every other major FPS title launched around the time of Apex has had at minimum one significant aim assist nerf, many games launched after have outright banned it in mixed lobby inputs (valorant, OW2), the only game to keep the original strength of AA from the 2019 period is Apex, it's fallen way behind in balance compared to other games. 

In a PC game where the overwhelming majority of players are MNK, the fact the upper ranks are predominantly controller shows there is not just a slight advantage to aim assist users, it's significant and top controller players state this as a fact. Human beings cannot compete with the accuracy a player using a script gets, it doesn't matter if we have our whole arm, AA users have what is effectively a type of aim bot.

Why are we still stuck on no fill?,"I cant accept that all this time later, the only reaction we still ever give to eachother over solos is ""just no fill"" everyone else is gonna have a team in these sweaty bloodbath aggro till oblivion pubs so i have to fill to have a playable experience that doesnt end with a sweatball 3 stack seeing me make a pixel wiggle and then chasing me for the rest of the match like a bunch of losers ""iTs A SoLo FuCk OuR FiGhT gEt HiM"". Outside of those that are of the cracked sort lol no fill has always came across as an unfair insult. Salt on a wound that had no fucking business ever being created. Solos caused zero player retention issues. It was that 1st attempt at a collection event that pushed all those players away. Look it up, you find nothing but everyone loving the mode, having an entire week of kickass fun, because apex is apex, its fun as fuck no matter what. But everyone was PISSED about the iron crown store, and bloodhound's axe being locked behind so much $$$. That pricing model, the crowns, the way it was handled. THATS what hurt the game. I'll never understand why they turned solos into the scapegoat. Its kinda bullshit... respectfully to respawn. But someone got that wrong as fuck.

We deserve solo pubs. Nothing bad is gonna happen. 

With all these tf3 hints floating around what would the harm even be? 

Its time for solo pubs. It WILL be just as fun. 

The best part of all of it? If you dont like solos... duos and trios are 2 clicks away, you dont even have to acknowledge its existence. It will not hurt your experience. May even have the opposite effect. Cuz those stupid solo pushing and vanishing from the match ass wraith/octanes are probably gonna be playing solos... so they wont be on your team. The people playing squads will actually want to be there. 

Face it. Solo players are part of the gaming community. Let us have fun how we want. Eomm can literally have my soul if i could do it in solos. Thatd literally be how id spend my next 5000 gaming hours. Not even kidding.

And yes im painfully aware of the ""team game"" argument. But REALLY think about how often you're already solo. Because your teammates are long dead n gone into dc hell.",apexlegends,1695566351.0,t3_16qzbnl

TDM is the loneliest experience I've had playing APEX,"I'm sharing my thoughts on TDM so far.

https://preview.redd.it/fgxohe0lybja1.png?width=3440&format=png&auto=webp&s=564a694855341c8801f4811ef9184d86e4e4ee8d

If you love it okay good for you, I've already heard enough of it.

Every single game has led to at least 3 to 4 people on my team leaving. I've won some 1v3 fights in Arenas, and while I'm not a great player I usually have the motivation to go in and give it a good shot in an engagement. With TDM it's basically pointless and I don't think I'll be able to 2v5 again.

By the end of this match, it was just9nnnnnn and I against 5 players. He and I weren't in the same party so we couldn't even voice chat if he did have a mic(if that's how it works, I'm unsure). Couldn't even celebrate a moderately hard fight with someone. What's the point? Did I get good numbers? Did I get my stats up? What's the point of playing an FPS multiplayer if you can't even communicate with people and coordinate? Can't even celebrate a victory.

To add to that for some reason, none of the games I've been in do people want to use voice chat anymore. In arenas, people would at least at the minimum use text chat. Half the fun was loading into Arenas and talking to new people, talking about what strats we wanted to play and celebrating clutches. Sometimes you'd hear about their day or some crazy thing that happened to them at work. It's just dead now. There's no Social aspect to it anymore.

TDM is a 30-minute slog of kill, die, respawn, kill, die, respawn, kill, die and respawn till it hits 50. 30 Mins of silence. I don't want to sit down for 30 mins with 6 sweats beaming on me. If your lucky/unlucky enough you'll have 6 preds just take all the vertical points and then take you out, again and again, quick enough to end the match.  Arenas in contrast was perfect for an easy 10-minute match that might stretch out to 20ish minutes. And the possibilities were endless for how a match could go.

I might as well just go back to CS:GO, set all the bots to the hardest difficulty and play by myself.

Everyone cries that the matchmaking in the arenas was broken and didn't work. But the mode had direction and NEEDED teamwork. Now we have matchmaking that still doesn't work and a half-baked TDM mode that if I'm being honest is just a bit mindless and has no soul to it.

"Congrats guys, you are pulling the same bullshit that makes literally every dev cut off communication with their fanbase. Enjoy being ignored from now on, you earned it.","I've been the in Titanfall community since the beginning. The Devs being on reddit, and talking to us, was a wonderful priviledge to have. And we knew it was something they didn't have to do. And now that hate threads, none of which are even remotely grounded in the real world at anymore (sorry guys, you really have lost sight of reality if you are utterly outraged by $7 lootboxes in a free game), are making the people, who make the game you like, hate you.

The Titanfall community wasn't like this. It wasn't perfect, but it wasn't this. And it makes me sad that this is what happens when the devs try to talk to you. You are so unreasonable, that even when the apologized to you, you just smelled blood, and went after them even harder. 

But don't worry, I'm sure Respawn has learned their lesson. Do not engage with you people anymore. There is no point. You want to be angry. To be outraged. It gets you high.

Chill the fuck out kids. 

P.S. - if you have ever argued that the lootboxes in Apex are evil because muh addiction, and its bad because they cost slightly more than average lootboxes cost, and how DARE Respawn not utterly capitulate to my demands, go take a looooong look in the mirror man.

Now every second post is like: Respawn bad, EA broke game, they only wan't money, servers bad, event sucks, cry cry more crying. 

I don't know, if I'm the only one who feels like that, but the game is still playable. Actually pretty good for a Free to Play Game. Sure it has some bugs and issues, but they don't interrupt gameplay. It's true that the servers sometimes have some bad days or ours, but this only happens rare.

If you guys have a problem with the money making events, then just DON'T buy packs etc. The game still gives you stuff for free. You even can get legendary Items for free. 

If you think the game isn't playable in its state right now, the just DON'T play it. Litteraly nobody is forcing you to play it.

Stop complaining about Respawn and EA. Even if it should be true, that they are ruining this game and that they are companies ruined from greed, they don't care about you complaining.

You’re not going to like this one. Respawn shouldn’t listen to Reddit or cave to our loud demands.,"Muzzle Flash is a design decision and likely won’t be changed as it hasn’t been yet. Reducing Muzzle Flash reduces the importance of the Gold Barrel stabiliser.

Reddit is a TINY, relatively insignificant number of the total user base of the game. All our bleating, whinging and moaning is, to some extent, background noise to the massive amount of hard data Respawn have on player numbers, how long people play for, how SBMM has affected retention rates, how often people play, how long they play for, their average number of kills per match and historically, how many ‘new’ accounts are being created (so called Smurf accounts) and how quickly these Smurf accounts are pushed into SBMM Matches. It is this Data that will drive any changes made, not our unrelenting shouting and demanding.

Because of the above, SBMM likely won’t be removed despite the continual vitriol here and on Twitter if the cold, hard data back up that players are playing for longer, playing more often and perhaps even spending money.

Players often plead and beg with developers and publishers not to listen to Pro players, streamers and content creators to make changes because they’ve asked for them or insist on them or they’ll stop playing. And while some Developers don’t listen, many do, often to the games detriment. Now people on this Sub are pleading with Respawn to listen to pro players and streamers to make changes for the supposed benefit of the game. You have guys like Ninja saying SBMM is a bad thing, yes they routinely used to rinse servers pre-SBMM with 20 kill, 2K games because they were matched with much lower level players. How is that retaining players? How would it feel to be think ‘I’m getting the hang of this game now, let’s play another game. Wait, who’s this guy that’s champion? 10k kills, 200 wins, why is he in my game? That’s unfair’? SBMM ensures that guys like Ninja are paired with similar players with similar abilities. If he wants SBMM removed it’s because he wants to go back to 20+ kill steamroller games because it makes him feel good and he gets adoration from his Stream buddies and subscribers. That doesn’t matter to Respawn. They deal with DATA, not anecdotes and number of subscribers.

Do I think SBMM in its current form works? No, but I don’t want it to be removed either. Sure it needs some adjusting, and it likely has been several times without them announcing it. I’m currently 200 points short of Platinum in ranked so no amazing player but I’m hitting streaks of two and three wins in a row some nights on standard and ranked. Sure, last night we got absolutely cleaned out a couple of times but every time it was bad decision making, poor positioning or pushing a squad or player when we shouldn’t have. I’ve never felt that the game was being unfair with me as I’ve been playing since two weeks after launch and should be able to hold my own with other players and I often do.

Servers aren’t great it’s true but fixing that isn’t as easy as ‘tick rate=60Hz’ on the server code. Call of Duty has a tick rate of 12Hz. TWELVE. As multiplayer shooters go Apex isn’t so bad and there’s only been a few times when I blamed server tick rate over my own stupidity or lack of aim. Faster IS better but Respawn picked the current tick rate for a reason. 

Also, Developers don’t post regularly anymore because they get ripped to pieces any time they do. If I had the option to not do something without it directly affecting my job and happiness, of course I’d avoid it like the plague!",apexlegends,1577026393.0,t3_ee5o7s

The devs are most certainly aware, and if they don’t have a nerf slated for the next update I will eat my shoe.

This subreddit used to be fun, with mostly highlights and clips and funny moments, but now it’s nothing but bitching. Every time it pops up in my feed it’s just a text post rant about how much the poster hates the game right now. Im honestly considering leaving the sub. 

@mods can we get a daily negativity thread or something? Some way to filter it out so that the rest of the sub is reserved for cool clips and constructive discussion instead of the toxic mess it is right now?",apexlegends,1696271797.0,t3_16y4hn4
Please stop posting your wins. They are not impressive.,"Winning in this game is not nearly as hard as winning in other BR games (Fortnite, PUBG, Blackout) where you can sometimes go 10 games without a win easily even as an experienced player. Whereas in Apex you can sometimes win 3 in a row with randoms while eating 

Why, though? Well, there are only 60 players to beat, as opposed to one hundred. Also being in squad at all times makes it easier than solos and duos due to callouts, teamwork, unorganized enemy teams, etc. That is even more true if you are playing with friends and against randoms.

More importantly, you don’t have to beat 50 other duets, nor have 99 individuals to outwit. Squads are just plain easier than solo and duo playlists. Of course you could argue that there are OP squads that are just too good to beat, but if these three individual players where in the same solo lobby as you, I bet there would be even a lesser chance of winning 

Tldr: I’m happy you’re getting wins, brother. But I thought some needed a reality check. These “just got my third win today!” posts are almost cringeworthy and are useless to the sub

I do not intend to rain on anyone’s parade. I love seeing posts about a young kid getting his first win, or an older gamer coming back to shooters and getting his first championship. Kudos. But the average gamer posting about their wins everyday need to cool off as it is not an impressive feat ",apexlegends,1552741551.0,t3_b1s8fw

"The mods can delete this if they want, but it needs to be said.","The community in this sub is absolutely trash right now. This feels like grade school, and the kids that are getting bullied (devs) finally stepped up against the bullies ( they know he they are). And now the devs are being viewed as unprofessional because they hurt y’all feelings by calling you freeloaders, asshats, dicks, etc.  
It’s like you guys can’t fathom how frustrating it is to be in the devs position right now, imagine putting in all this work for this game, making a bad call because the big wigs who want more money from us twisted their arms. Then when the devs decided to be the bigger man and apologize publicly to us, they got berated but hate mail, threats, endless taunts and insults, and just plain out bullied on here in front of everybody. They stayed professional much longer than I would have been able to.  But right when they clap back at the assholes that deserved it, you guys light your torches and tear down on them even harder.  
I feel bad for these devs that have to put up with your whiney bullshit every day of the week. And I don’t blame them if they hurt your fragile feelings. If you feel like this was directed at you, it’s because it is. And you should feel ashamed, even though I know you won’t. 

I’ll still play this game everyday, and support Respawn when I can afford it and feel like it’s a fair deal. I hope a dev sees this, and I want them to know that I’m sorry so many people in here suck at being decent human beings.

"A Letter to Respawn, Thank you and goodbye","Letter to Respawn

&#x200B;

Thank you for Apex Legends, it was a blast!

&#x200B;

You gave me an awesome game out of nowhere for free! I have had a couple of hundred hours of fun.

For that I gave you $15 (BP + 5 crates) which is a great deal for the amount of fun I had even though I will not finish the BP.

&#x200B;

However I think this is where we have to part ways and I wish it wasn't so.

&#x200B;

A combination of problems has turned what was once fun into an exercise in frustration. 

&#x200B;

I play on PC which is such a bitter-sweet platform to play on. 

It is the purest way to enjoy a FPS game with high refresh monitors and super accurate and satisfying peripherals but it comes at the cost of bugs and cheaters.

&#x200B;

I experienced bugs and crashes early on but you have solved those issues for my system at least, thank you.

&#x200B;

I am continuing to experience cheaters every day, this is a massive problem for me. The ban waves were felt and appreciated but were short lived. 

Every night I die to a hacker and it robs me of motivation to play. 

&#x200B;

I don't expect that you can magic up a solution to stop them all once and for all but I am not seeing satisfying results from my point of view either. 

If I am honest it looks as though not too much thought was put into stopping cheaters before the game released other than signing a contract with EAC.

The reason it looks that way to me is because everything seemed to be left so open, launch options, config options and plenty more from the cheat providers point of view I am sure. 

This makes me feel as though PC was not a huge priority for release which of course is entirely your decision, I am sure there is plenty of money to be made from console players. 

&#x200B;

Another problem that causes me frustration is that you have failed to incorporate a structure that rewards good teammates or punishes poor teammates. 

Currently being a good teammate is from a performance standpoint the worst way to play. I will explain what my thoughts are on this as I don't enjoy playing a team game selfishly.

&#x200B;

Leavers: People who quit as soon as they are down. Firstly now you are a 2 person squad pitted against 3 person squads, obviously a disadvantage.

Secondly if they didn't quit straight away I am now risking my neck to run over and save them, putting myself in strategically poor positions in the hope of becoming a 3 person team again. 

Alas they quit, I am out of position and probably am now facing the squad they died to and I haven't picked up much loot as I prioritized my teammates life, That's a big risk with little reward.

&#x200B;

Complainers that leave: The people who quit when you have not satisfied their expectation of a good teammate. These ones ruin my decision making process the most. 

Yesterday I had one that complained and then left because I checked a death box on the way to save him because I had a peacekeeper (No second weapon at all) with one shell and my other teammates banner.

The other one I had yesterday quit because I revived him during a fight and he got knocked again due to a 3rd party ""kill them all first idiot"" he said before leaving. 

It is so hard to know whether you need to respawn / revive them straight away because they have short attention spans or make a safe zone for them to thrive in first, doing the wrong one at the wrong time will result in being a teammate down and possibly out of position. 

&#x200B;

On the flip side I go down and wonder what sort of teammates I have, will they rescue me? I give them the chance because I don't like leavers. Sadly this means that I often wait only to get looted and not respawned, banner recovered but not respawned, banner recovered but no respawn till they have finished looting everything in that quarter of the map etc

I imagine this leads to people becoming leavers themselves when they might not have been previously. 

&#x200B;

The chance to practice: Why is the training ground so limited?  No attachments etc and I don't understand the big square targets as opposed to player sized targets that move and jump etc. I find myself having a little warmup in CSGO before playing, sometimes I just stay in CSGO. 

&#x200B;

Last and from my point of view least important, the battlepass is a bit lackluster. It really didn't capture my enthusiasm at all but the game itself has me wanting to keep playing anyway were it not for the problems I listed above.

&#x200B;

So thank you for the game, I had fun but am not having fun anymore so I am off.

I hope these things become fixed so that I can come back but if I am honest the longer I put a game down the less likely I am to come back, that's just me.

This is by far the most toxic community in any team based game I’ve ever played,"Just had a game in ranked a teammate and I landed one place. Another teammate lands a lil off and immediately goes into a 3v1. He dies, we wipe them and recover his banner and respawn him. Only problem is he never came back. The dude doesn’t move at all and dies in the storm then disconnects. We eventually end up finishing 4th. My teammate and I both dropped 1300 damage and 5+ kills. Not the best game ever but not bad by any means especially considering we played 90% of the game with two people.

I genuinely do not know what the solution is to fix this. This community is beyond toxic. If people get knocked and you don’t instantly drop everything to rez them they are leaving. I don’t know how much more I can take. 

I love this game. Absolutely HATE a large chunk of the community. Selfish, impatient and just huge babies. They need a solo mode because playing with randoms is just a terrible experience too often. People are basically throwing games the instant you do something they don’t like even if it doesn’t make sense.

Apex really dropped the ball,"I wanna be clear and say I'm not transphobic and I support people who choose to identify as male, female etc. (I've never met anyone who isn't either, so I've never really considered what other options people have). I know making life decisions for those people is tough and can really make things harder for you to live your life, like what some people in the sub are trying to do ,and I hope that I don't.

The Apex community is really pushing the limits with Catalyst. On one hand, you have Respawn marketing her as trans, which is a money grab if anything. I know that since day one the original team made the legends diverse and I appreciate it, especially since it took me months to find out that Gibby was gay, Bloodhound was non-binary and that Bangalore was lesbian. Finding out these things didn't matter for my perspectives of the characters because, they were already great characters, so why would their sexuality/sex matter?

Since then we've also gotten Loba, Valk and Fuse, who I found out more about over time and still didn't care about more or less. Honestly I hate Horizon more than any of them and she's straight, white and has a kid (who I also hate, glad he's probably dead the little ginger). None of these characters were marketed as LGBTQ and they didn't need to be, they had more to them character development wise.

Catalyst has nothing going for her besides the fact that she is, in fact, trans. That and Hammond captured her terrorist girlfriend. That's it. Her trailer didn't show her abilities, it didn't show her being able to fight anyone. There was more crystals shown than bullets that were fired honestly. It probably wasn't Respawns intention to make her this way, the concept art that had been going around for ages looked so much cooler than another blue-haired astrology girl like we got, and it really feels like pandering to the LGBT players just to say ""look we added someone different to the game just for you!""

This isn't how you should be advertising new legends. It obviously causes a divide, and for reasons that are going to hurt people's feelings, whether they're people who are going to cry that the new character isn't Aryan, or if they're people who've struggled to live their life and still cop shit for it online when they don't deserve it. 

The people who sit in the comments and just reply with ""shut up transphobe"" aren't helping, you're not trying to educate and half of you don't even know what you're talking about. I'm friends with trans women who flex that they have a bigger cock than I do, and it's funny. You're all getting so twisted in a knot that people are trans (and most of you aren't, you're just LGBT and think you know better) and some people are trying to just be funny on the internet.

I would honestly argue Vantage is the worst legend,"Her passive is solid, but most of the time not very useful even in highly communicated teams, it’s really only useful for the beginning of the game when your trying to catch squads with grey armor.

 Her tact is by far the worst movement ability, I’d much rather use revs climbing passive over this. It takes so long to activate and she moves so slowly through the air.

 And her ult? It’s ok but I’d argue it’s by far the most useless ult, sure you can knock a person, but it really only happens when your kinda far. Every other ult can be used in close combat, which most fights are. It really needs to be able to outline enemies you hit so you can see them through walls, since currently she’s barely a recon legend. Most of the time with her ult you’ll manage to hit someone only once and that’s it, that’s your ult, congrats you didn’t help with the actual fight at all, your all the way out there sniping and not up here helping with the actual fight. 

She’s really only decent for beginning to mid games, I’d argue lifeline mirage and Rev are far more useful through the entire match

The devs did nothing wrong! (in their comments),"imho,

They were obviously responding to hate with some vitriol of their own and very mild at that. 'Don't be a dick' shouldn't be a statement a company has to apologize for in my book.

Same with the asshat comments, it's completely true what that dev said, online communities like a subreddit are insanely fickle and huge outbursts of hate and anger often impact devs and their personal social media accounts (like twitter).

imo, they where just speaking straight facts right there.

Probably wasn't wise what they did for sure, but I mostly agree with them.

&#x200B;

People need to realize these games are made to milk whales and you shouldn't expect 'fair' monetization, because in the end there's no such thing as 'fair' monetization! It's all fucking relative, most people don't pay a dime. Most people only give enough of a shit about cosmetics to try and earn them through game time not with their wallet. EVERYONE VALUES THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY! I mean think about it, is a skin really worth $10? $5? You can buy *entire games* for the price of a few skins in a F2P game. It's never been 'reasonable' because it's not supposed to be!

HELL MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO SPLURGE ON GAMES!

Has anyone ever taken the time to think and realize how revolutionary these types of games are?! Gaming has been made accessible to the average joe who can't buy the newest FPS every few months, it's honestly amazing when you think about it. So many people with minimum wage jobs who can now scrounge to buy a second hand console years into it's cycle or build a budget PC with older parts and can enjoy *pretty dam good* games for FREE!

As long as pay 2 win isn't included, games like Apex have brought gaming to more people than ever before. Gaming used to be for enthusiasts, then for rich kids then the middle class, now nearly everyone can enjoy gaming.

I dunno look at it like wealth redistribution I think many people are underestimating how much benefit this model brings to so many people.

Half a year ago I remember people saying ""just get rid of those loot boxes, I would pay way more money if I could just buy the skins"". You got that option now.

Stop complaining about landing at fragment,"So there was this post complaining about people landing at fragment and stated that it was the worst place to land. If the jumpmaster wants to land there, there is a reason. That reason could be that they want the challenge or that they land there all the time and survive most of the time or it's the most fun. If they are landing there, they can likely handle it (with a full squad or solo if really good). Sure there will be games that they die right away and you lose but the games where you survive fragment are epic which makes it worth it.

If you are complaining about someone landing at fragment, you likely aren't contributing to the team much because you already feel like you are gonna die instantly. Maybe you should take it as an opportunity to grow and get better or try to beat your highest kills record or damage record.

Now if it's ranked, I would be very cautious about landing fragment once you hit plat or higher. Bronze to gold is great for landing fragment because you will level up waaaayyy faster landing there and getting a few kills and surviving a few of the games. Once you hit plat, it's usually better to play the ranked games slower and safer so landing elsewhere is good.

Stop. Fucking. Bitching.,"Just in general, stop. I'm making this post from the outcry of people complaining about the bundles, but I honestly think it's unwarranted. Yes, it is lazy and a ""cash grab"" but, they do need cash you know. 

This is a free game, you play it as much as you want, people stream and upload videos of this game, making money, when they don't have to put anything in. I think people really do overlook the fact that the only cost of this game is however much space is requires on your respective system. YOU CAN just not buy the bundles. It is not necessary, most people don't even like them, it gives no advantage. It is not worth dozens of posts complaining about. 

I see people comparing this to Iron Crown and the developers during that event calling us ""freeloaders"" and ""asshats"", but all of that is frankly irrelevant. The Iron Crown event was the first major event that they put a lot of time and effort into, and it was mainly met with criticism. Their response is very acceptable in my mind and even so, they apologized profusely but it's for some reason still being brought up today. We the users constantly insult the developers and act like we know what's better for the game and then when they respond insulting us once we go, ""You dare have the audacity to return the insults?!"" That's just always bothered me.

The prices of most cosmetics are, well, pretty outrageous, but I restate the fact that this game is free. Lootboxes, bundles, event skins, these are how Respawn makes their money. And yet we complain. We don't want to spend money but then expect the game to still get regularly updated, new content, and upgraded servers. How the fuck do y'all expect them to afford all that shit? By charging $10 for people every 3 months? Servers are very expensive and I don't see anyone donating large amounts of money for them.

Summary: You get what you pay for, and you don't pay anything. Actually, you get more than what you pay for. Any individual whose bought every single possible thing you can buy in this game, would not even pay for the servers for a month. And most people don't even buy much shit.

Reddit Blackout: State of the Subreddit Going Forward,"Hello Legends,

Last week, [we held a poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/14a9tmr/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_and_where_we_go/) so the community could vote on the direction of the subreddit going forward.

The results of the poll are as follows:

* Open the subreddit (39%)
* Restrict the subreddit (9%)
* Go private (52%)

However, we have observed a consistent pattern of brigading by non-subscribers, who have been sharing polls amongst themselves and voting on every poll to keep many subreddits closed. Unfortunately, Reddit does not offer an option to restrict voting in polls to subscribed users.

After carefully considering the comments on that thread - most in favor of reopening - we held internal discussions and reached the following agreement:

* The subreddit will be **open for posting and commenting** on weekdays (Monday - Friday).
* The subreddit will be **restricted** on weekends. During this time, you cannot post new threads, but you can comment on existing ones. The Free Talk weekend thread will be stickied during this period.

We believe this schedule achieves three key objectives:

* Ensuring that the subreddit is accessible to everyone at all times.
* Allowing the community to create new threads during the week. This is when Respawn releases events, trailers, and other important updates. During update days like today, players can quickly surface bugs and issues.
* Many moderators previously used third-party clients to moderate. Now that we will be required to use the official and inadequate moderation tools, having a post downtime will allow us to keep up with reports, reduce spam, and respond to modmail promptly.

Other subreddits have taken a more radical approach to their content, but minimal disruption to the community is of utmost importance. We hope that you understand our approach.",apexlegends,1687282910.0,t3_14ehos6

This game is becoming cancerous,"-Edit 1 at bottom-

Original post:

And it's all thanks to the bitching and whining this subreddit keeps on doing. The amount of people I see on a daily basis that bitch about about:

* PK Being OP
* Charge Rifle Being OP
* Solos/Duos Bitching
* Legends too OP
* Devs not doing enough
* Devs being too quiet
* Guns being OP
* SBMM
* Plus More!

Everyone keeps on bitching about these things, continuously makes the same posts over and over again, and then blame the devs for not listening to them. (Don't get me started on Solos/Duos because it's like 5 posts in a single day about the same stupid shit).

It's no surprise that the devs barely respond in this subreddit because it feels like dealing with a constantly nagging, crazy wife every single day. I can only imagine how toxic it is for these devs to come here and read all this nonsense about bullshit that they are fully aware of. They know the game needs to balanced, but I'm sure it only makes it more frustrating  for them to come in here and respond with some minor changes to only get attacked by a frenzy of negative comments.

Now don't get me wrong, the devs are not innocent either with their monetization events, but that's EA flexing their grip on their balls. Some of you need to understand that it takes a lot to manage a community this big, especially for a FREE game, but the continuous complaining about the balance changes and game modes is becoming more toxic than the complaining of the League of Legends community, and they're toxic AF over there. This reddit is not the only thing they manage. They have plenty of other social media channels to manage and campaigns to run. 

This subreddit used to be filled with interesting gameplay videos, funny memes, creative art and other cool posts. Now it's just a flood of complaints, bitching, trash gameplay and other nonsense. I get it, some pros are calling for balancing changes as well, but trust me, the devs are well aware of it and I am sure they are working on it, cause it takes a lot of time to make sure things game is finely balanced. Y'all need some patience. Out of all the games I've played, including LoL, PUBG, RS, Diablo, COD, etc., this game is one of the most balanced games so far. Making this game any easier or dumber will ruin it. Apex Legends isn't meant to be an easy game. Yes, there are faults, but that happens with every game. But some of y'all really need to take a back seat, enjoy the game, and get gud.

P.S.- Downvote all you want, but IDGAF, the truth hurts.

Edit 1: I appreciate all the hate, love, wanna punch OP, wanna hug OP, and all other comments that I’ve read but we just need to be a better community guys and show the devs some love and make Apex Forever.

Unpopular Opinion: Apex Online Community is progressively becoming more and more TOXIC,"***Before jumping to assumptions hear me out first!*** 

>What makes a player ""good""? Is it the amount of Kills, Their Overall Rank, or is it the amount of time someone has put into the game? 

The only honest answer is the amount of Time played. For example the top streamers have admitted that they play at least 10 to 15 hours a day and the hardcore gamer normally plays around 6 to 9 hours a day to be compared to the average gamer who maybe plays around 15 to 24 hours a week. 

&#x200B;

In the beginning, everyone was super excited to just play the game... Now the majority of the post in the community look like this. 

1. Need Squad have 1200+ Kills Wraith Main
2. LFS, Sweaty, 2k+ Kills, LVL 100+, No under 18, must have Mic, Will be kicked if you suck
3. Need 1 fast pace looting skill chill player who stick together smart aggressive BloodHound and Wraith taken, Message me your stats. No Toxic People...

&#x200B;

Look... By all means I understand that the majority of player's want to play with other players who are on a similar ""skill"" level, but examples like 2 and 3 are becoming absolutely ridiculous and far too common! Kicking someone out because you think that they suck or having someone message you their stats so that you can determine if he or she is worthy enough to play a game with you... Seriously!

"Unpopular Opinion: This ""lack of content"" argument is flawed","PUBG was out for a year+ before it got any real content. It was more or less 100% bug fixes before then. 

Fortnite has been in development since 2011. 

Apex has been out for a few months, offers arguably one of the best BR experiences, and has already released 1 new hero, 1 new gun, and a season. It's not tons, but it's at the very least in-line with the same rollout time after launch as PUBG and Fortnite. I would argue that Apex's releases are coming out faster when you compare the first 3 months of PUBG and Fortnite, in fact I think this is pretty much indisputable.  

It's very curious why seemingly EVERY media outlet, streamer, and community member is parroting this ""LACK OF CONTENT"" line without giving it a second thought. 

The game is 3 months old. What ""content"" is everyone wanting so badly? No way everyone has mastered all of the heroes yet (How long did it take Blizzard to introduce Sombra in Overwatch?), and there are more than enough guns, So is it skins? Is that the ""content"" people want? Or a new map? How long did it take Fortnite to come out with a new map? oh wait...

Not trying to flame the community, but please someone explain in reasoned rational terms to me why the ""lack of content"" is being said by everyone? What is the content that you expect beyond what's been given 3 months out of the gate?",apexlegends,1558382197.0,t3_br0g97

EAC is pointless,"Since there is literally no talk at all about this, I'll maybe be the first to bring it to light.
Ever since the release of the steam deck to the public, Apex gave Proton the go ahead.

What this basically means in a nutshell is, Apex Legends will natively run on Linux. Think about this though. 

EAC on Windows requires administrator privileges to actually function as an anticheat, which is understandable. However on Linux it is ran as a normal user. Therefore meaning anything you run with ""Administrator"" permissions, the anticheat cannot see. I don't know if you see the issue there or not, but effectively that means with two simple kernel config changes, the anticheat is completely ineffective. It cannot scan for cheats. The only line of defense is heuristics checks serverside, but if you add some randomisation to the aimbot, it defeats those checks. 

If you thought maybe these past few seasons have been awful with the amount of cheaters, well. There's your answer.

Sources: myself.

I am currently Apex Predator in Arenas and battle royale. 

I have been cheating since season 13, and I have not been banned once. I already contacted EAC to report my findings over 2 months ago, and nothing has been changed. Maybe now this will get the attention it deserves and ALL cheaters who think they are untouchable get banned.

When the iron crown event first started people were enraged that everything cost so much and I was one of those people. I only wanted one skin and was discouraged that the only way was to buy the $7 loot box for a chance. We asked them to put in a feature to buy them individuals and they did. Then what did we do? We said they planned this all along and the toxicity got worse. In my personal opinion $20 for one skin is not to much to ask yet we continue to call the devs names and threaten to stop playing the game entirely. Is it really that hard to understand that one dev got angry and said some very mild insults compared to everything else I’ve seen non devs say about respawn? It’s clear these devs care about this project and I do to. I’ve been playing their games since the first titanfall and to see so many people get outraged at one simple mistake is disheartening.

You Guys Have Failed This Game,"- Cheaters
- Abused Aim-Assist
- Matchmaking
- Unbalanced Characters
- Glitches/Exploits are never fixed 

The state of the game is disgusting. 
You ignore these complaints from ordinary players regardless how good they are. You neglect your community by refusing to be transparent. You add lame ideas into the game and I'm not even going to get into all the identity politics that's shoved in there, but instead these repetitive abilities such as wall-hacks, which was fine with one character, but we didn't need more. Then there are slows everywhere, Caustic, Valk, Gibbyt, Bangalore, Wattson, etc.. You're nerfing characters that were balanced (Bangalore), you're exaggerating the size of AoE abilities such as with the new character. 

It feels like you've given up. What your release lacks originality, lacks any thought and/or testing. This game used to be fun. Been hitting Masters since Season 8 and started playing in Season 7. However, even ranked is a chore. Randoms on my team lacks any and all ability to play this game as a team. They have no game sense, can't find cover, can't aim, constantly die by the ring, make useless sacrifices trying to win a 1v3, who are these losers? Why are they on my team? They have an account level of 20-50 and I'm already 1000+, come on?!

Then you have Mixtape and since I've given up grinding in Ranked due to all the issues which doesn't make it worth it, figured I'd just stick around for Control, but holy f, the people playing are even worse. 90% of the team only cares about who they kill. I'm almost guaranteed if I alone stay at our primary Control Point, because the moment I leave it to claim B, we lose our point since nobody else on the freaking team cares to notice... The when we have B, everyone is literally out and about, while we're losing B and one person can't defend B against an entire squad of enemy players. People are dysfunctional. Countless posts have been made on how you can potentially have people contribute more, such as removing the public kill count per players, and replace it with time spend defending/capturing a zone. After all, that's what the mode is about. It's not about how many players you kill.

There are so many issues with this game and it kept piling and piling, now you have this dumpster fire, which is literally threatened by some game called ""The Finals"" which is also a mess, but it's justified because it's new. And not just that, if you think these collaborations will help Apex, I'd be worried, because you might just be introducing Apex players to better games and they'll instead move over to those. Apex is in no state to be making collabs, unless it's a game like "" The Day Before"" where perhaps you would keep your play base intact.

Fix the damn game. Take a season off, if you're honest and tell us that one season will not have much, so that you can spend that time to fix the major issues (cheating, matchmaking, bugs), I'm pretty sure that the portion of your audience that matter, would understand. However, if this keeps on going, bit by bit, you'll be losing those players for other games, The Finals took a good chunk, I've seen it and that's not the only new game that's in the works and will be releasing. 

Nevetheless, as it has been proven before, you devs don't care if the complaint comes from just a random nobody. So I'll end it here. ¯\ (ツ) /¯",apexlegends,1702849374.0,t3_18ks376

Is Horizon Overpowered?,"After fighting and playing as Horizon I think there are definitely elements of herself that are too powerful. One thing I've have to stress about movement based characters is that they should NOT be hard to track. Unfortunately Apex Legends does have this problem with two characters. Pathfinder and Horizon. Pathfinder can be hard to track when he grapples due to him leaving no trail to track his movements, same with Horizon.

Is that fair? No. Actually it's not. Every other movement based character has a way to track them via trail and noise. Octane, Wraith, and even Loba have trails to their movement abilities and noises. Why are Pathfinder and Horizon the exception? No clue.

Now let's talk about Horizon, is she over powered? The answer is.... yes and no. There are just elements of her that are too powerful.

1. - Tracking: Horizon is an incredibly hard Legend to track in a fight and has no real predictable movement to her ability based on the player. You can lose track of her very fast and it makes fighting against her incredibly frustrating.

2. - Sound: Her Gravity Lift is so remarkably silent that I'm sure you've been flanked by a Horizon and never heard a anything, even when nothing was happening. If you're not right by where she used it, you're not hearing it.

3. - High Ground: I'm sorry but having a tactical of all things giving your whole team high ground is a bit too powerful. As I said you can get flanked by a whole team and not even hear it with Horizon. Not to mention all other characters that can provide you with high ground is regulated to an Ultimate ability.

4. - Tactical Cooldown: Her Cooldown is 15 Seconds, her Lift lasts for 10 seconds, meaning there's only a measly 5 seconds until she gets it again. That's incredibly strong and very much the reason Pathfinder was too powerful. It seems th devs just took a step back with that. Not only that but her Tactical cools down while it's in use. 15 seconds would be fine if her tactical Cooldown started after the Gravity Lift stopped working. Not as it's going on. That or make it 25 seconds.

5. - Healing: Healing on her Gravity Lift is just OP. Sorry it's just not Fair. Getting high ground for your team, low Cooldown, 100% accuracy, and Healing? That's too much...

I do think she definitely needs a nerf. Honestly in a game about having accuracy, having characters that can yeet away with no way to track them is pretty op.",apexlegends,1607331745.0,t3_k8d7io

These are just his abilities. And I don't like them. There is nothing fun about his addition to the Apex Games. Just wallhacks. 

Why do I dislike him but not Bloodhound?  
Bloodhound is more balanced IMO. He can only scan every now and then and he can track you down. His scan also give away his own position in a way. The scan does not cancel anything. It does not give health info. It's a lot weaker wallhack and not constant. And that's all right.

Wattson Buff Idea... Passive that doesn't require a turbocharger for her,,apexlegends,1648452000.0,t3_tq3qpw
Horizon is overpowered garbage.,"Seriously! Her ability to just pop a lift and get a full battery off BASICALLY FOR FREE is so fucking annoying. No other movement Legend has the ability to do that kind of thing while they're moving and using their ability to get in and out of a fight. Wraith can't heal in her phase. Path can't heal in his grapple or zip. Rev can't heal in his leap. So WHY does Horizon get to heal in her tactical? And why does hers get to be deployed instantly, with no charge up or anything to it? You just push the button and up you go!

Even with the more recent nerfs she is still so indescribably annoying to fight against. I have never actively hated a legend more than Horizon right now. Anytime I see a Horizon in game, no matter the game mode, I make it my mission to destroy them because they are the most annoying Legend to fight against.

I have two ideas that would bring her within the balance of power with everyone else. First, let us shoot out the gravity lift. We can shoot a lot of other Legend abilities, let us shoot out her gravity lift. It's a tiny little dot on the floor so it's not like it's easy, but it will help. Second, just like wraith, give her a delay before she's able to throw it out. Lock the player in a one or two second animation of throwing the thing out before they can start floating away. Then it will require actual dedication to use and a little foresight, then just a ""whoops I pushed! Time to reset and fly away!"" button.

Stop with the complaining.,"I dont normally post on here, just browse for lore, news etc but I'm getting really fed up with all the complaining about the price of things when a new event is announced.

People seem to forget the amount that Respawn has given us for free or next to nothing with this game.

 Starting off with the battle pass, if you bought season 1 then technically you haven't had to spend any money for seasons 2 or 3 due to earning enough currency as progression rewards. Season 1 rewards weren't that great so Respawn listened and changed it up now as well as premium currency we receive crafting materials to craft a legendary of our choice instead of buying it as well as all the other great stuff we receive.

They also listen to the community feedback when it comes to game modes and set up events which then allow us to earn even more stuff for free and, when they launch a new legend they dont even ask us to spend money on that, instead we can unlock them for free from just playing the game.

Finally, and most importantly, the game that we love to play is free, updates to existing and new maps are free. No need to spend £40 on a game then more on season passes to get new content.

I personally spend maybe around £10-£20 a month on the game and alot of hours playing (not very well, I may add) and dont see what the issue is with having one of three types of event cost a bit more. The company has to make money somewhere after all. If you dont like the price of something, dont pay it but please for the love of sanity leave it at that and stop whining and moaning. It's that kind of behaviour which lead to the problems last time and subsequently has lead to the developers reducing communication with the community which, IMO can only be a bad thing.",apexlegends,1570535719.0,t3_deywnz

When she had the automatic doc heal drone with shield, was it annoying yes! (Just like Gibby’s dome is annoying) was it OP definitely not. I’ve won plenty of fights against that.

"To anyone who makes content for Apex: DO NOT buy Apex Packs, DO NOT encourage viewers to buy Apex Packs, and DEFINITELY DO NOT make content of you opening a large number of packs at once.","Sadly, I just got a notification for Nick Eh 30’s stream (who is objectively the least toxic Fortnite streamer out there, insanely positive guy) that was titled “Opening 500 Apex Packs” or something along those lines.

I really don’t want this community to go down that rabbit hole, as that ruined Overwatch to some extent. Muselk and many other Overwatch YTers (at the time) having so many lootbox opening videos certainly validated Activision-Blizzard to continue charging users for loot boxes or even merely continuing to offer loot boxes.

Now we all are aware of EA’s infamy regarding the topic, and we are all aware of how much of a slippery slope they can get into when it comes to microtransactions. And I think we can all agree any form of loot boxes are malicious, especially because they don’t label it as gambling, even though that’s exactly what it is **because you don’t know what you’re getting, ever.**

What these videos and streams of “Opening x Apex Packs” will do is deteriorate the community and validate other players to go out and buy Apex Packs, because they see a content creator get so excited over getting a certain item so they think they’ll have a decent chance at getting what they want. 

This will end up giving EA a net increase in loot box sales which will communicate to them that due to such a profit on these loot boxes, they should keep putting em out, and never will the video game industry be entirely free of this malicious concept of a microtransaction. EA will always continue to sell their players loot boxes as long as people buy them. And content creators are inadvertently advertising to the playerbase these loot boxes. 

So please, if you intend to make content for Apex Legends and you know you have a reasonably large following, know that if you decide to make content off of buying Apex Packs you are supporting the loot box economy in the video game industry.",apexlegends,1549511700.0,t3_anzmtz

Is it a generational thing or does nobody play the game to just play the game anymore?,"I've seen outrages like this happen many times in the past and it always has something to do with ""skins"" or ""lootboxes"" or monetization practices. 

I've been playing APEX since day 1 and have never purchased anything. When I do occasionally get a APEX pack for free in game or somehow unlock something its just kind of a fun little bonus and im always happy with whatever I got.

So my honest question is, Does anybody actually play games to try and get better a them or even for just plain enjoyment? Or is the overarching motivation in games nowadays simply the grind to ""unlock everything possible""?

Lets sue EA,"We are paying customers. A chargeback rule states - ""money back if not satisfied with goods or services received."" We are not satisfied, obviously. Especially anyone who bought a pack this event fits under the category because they can't play the game.

i don't know if you guys are familiar with the youtuber ""Kandy drew""and ""boomrazzle""  but i felt like that guy, and his aim is pretty damn good. mine is not supposed to be anywhere close to his Imo. it was fucking mental. the power of aim assist really is insane on this game. now it has me wanting to only play PC games that don't have controller support hahahaha.

Why is apex legends so sweaty?,"Ive been playing apex for 2 years now. Im a decent player, got 20 kills multiple times and i reached diamond like 6 times. I play at least a little bit every season and sometimes i play for longer. My over all k/d is around 3.0. 

My problem is that i constantly get paired against people way better than me. And i mean way, way better than me. My enemies have around 20.000-100.000 kills almost every game. They got triple predator badges and ( for example) R99 weapon mastery level 102. I am not over exaggerating, not at all. My memory for names is very good. Ive faced a youtuber (YTdamonbieber) 5 times this season. Yall can look him up hes a wraith player, 100K kills. 

I know everyone knows how bad the matchmaking is. But even after losing 10 games on drop, my worst enemies are still way out of league. By the way, ive faced the number 1 pred from last season 2 times today.

This just makes the game super unfun for me. Its like a civilian (me) fights against superman (enemies), its just terrible.

People complain about TTK when it really hasn't changed,"People are just complaining over a color change.

People have been complaining about the new TTk, saying it is ruining the game, but in all honesty, it really hasn't changed much. If you really think about it, available shields are basically the same as always. They just removed the 125 red shield (Which had ridiculous ttk before). But we still have 100, 75, 50, 25 shields.

Red (125) ---> Gone  
Purple (100) ---> Red Evo (100)  
Blue (75) ---> Purple Evo (75)  
White (50) ---> Blue Evo (50)  
Base Evo (25) ---> White Evo (25)

In other words, this patch basically removed 125 hp shields, changed the color for all other shields, and made it so 100 hp shields must be earned through gameplay. That´s it. No strong change to ttk, just a color change.

we have the same powered shields, there´s just less loot distribution to those shields, which is countered with the Evo/Crafting System. (This system promotes aggressive play, snipping, moving around the map more to get crafting materials, and discourages camping. If you camp all game you'll be f\*ckd late game cause you'll end up with a 50 pt shield in the final rings.) 

Honestly, In late games, every one has a 100 hp red Evo which is what happened the first 4 seasons, where everyone had 100 hp purple shields. If you don´t, its because you weren´t aggressive enough.

Only true thing is that gold shields aren´t as good now. 

Funny thing is, people wanted an EVO meta for so long, and that would have had a much lower ttk if everyone started with base 25 shield and no more. This new system gives an EVO Meta with a higher ttk since people can find higher leveled EVOs and can evolve them through crafting.",apexlegends,1597847925.0,t3_icouv8
The Game Developers Are Right,"The issue is that you want something in game for less money or for Free, hidden behind faux outrage about the gambling mechanics and a holier than thou misplaced sense of morality. 

It costs what it costs and if you want to gamble to get the stuff that's your own free will. The base game is free, its a damn good game that there is zero need to spend money on. 

I heard people say ""they are trying to rip us off"" , well you only get ripped of if you spend money on it. cosmetic items in game are a rip off anyway whether its £1 or £100 it means nothing. They are a meaningless extra in the game that if you want it you can go ahead and buy it. 

Respawn made probably the best battle royal game out there and kept the game play mechanics separate from their money making mechanics. As far as i am concerned they are well within their rights to charge what they want and how they want for added extras.

"Unpopular Opinion: Battle Pass Leveling is fine, not everyone gets to be LVL 100","Not sure why there is so much hate on the battle pass level system. Is the quality of the rewards what we all wanted? Not really, but that's a different discussion. People saying it takes too long to get the pass to 100 just shows the full on entitlement of this generation.

&#x200B;

If you want something, then you have to work for it. 1.5 hours a day roughly, assuming you are terrible and get 0 kills in game while never finishing top 3, is not the end of the world to reach the maximum level. For the people saying they only play the game 2-3 hours a week, this battle pass isn't meant for you. You can't expect to put in minimal effort and get maximum rewards. The max level SHOULD be a grind. It SHOULD be hard to accomplish. That's the reward for finishing it, knowing you were able to complete a hard task. If you were able to finish it by only putting in 36 hours over the course of 3 months then it wouldn't be worth it. Literally half of this sub complained about being bored with the game after hitting level 100 in the first month and wanting more to do. So they make the battle pass last longer to earn and everyone complains that it takes too long.

&#x200B;

Grow up. Put in the work. Earn the reward.

&#x200B;

Edit: Many people have mentioned the ""We all paid $10, we should get the loot we paid for!"" response. To that I say, no. You didn't pay $10 for loot, you paid $10 for a battle pass that rewards a ""reasonable"" amount of play with tiered levels of loot. The more you play, the more you get. What Respawn deems ""reasonable"" was likely overshot as it is much easier to add 2XP weekends and such to shorten the length than it would be to make it longer if they undershot their mark. If you didn't look into what the loot was or how long you needed to play before unlocking everything and still purchased it, that's on you. Do your research before buying a product. Don't buy it without knowing what it is and then complain about it afterwards because it wasn't what you thought it would be.",apexlegends,1553094043.0,t3_b3d1ve

"Respawn, please add a Solo Mode. Tons of people really want it & it would be great for the game.","I don’t understand why everyone & their uncle is so opposed to solo mode on this sub. It would literally take nothing away from your experiences in the game, it would only be a positive thing for players who want to play solo!

It would be in an entirely new playlist for just solo players & you can continue playing the game like you always have with the squads of 3 if you don’t like it. And of course they would balance it a little bit specifically for solo mode. The ping system could be replaced with something else or something just for solo players.

If you don’t want a solo mode, then fine! You don’t have to play it!

My experience with this game has been join up with 2 random teammates, go to a location, try to loot everything in sight, both my teammates are killed, & then I’m left to fight squads of 3 all by myself. So my experiences are usually 1v3 or 1v5-7 sometimes too if there’s more than 1 squad in an area which is completely unfair & not fun for me whatsoever & I just die.

For you not to realize these large Dev companies having multiple teams working on multiple projects is just insane. 

In regards to the inpatient community members, please just take a deep breath and realize they just released a season a month ago, and technically their last patch was 12 days ago (which is actually very good given that the season was released 30 or so days ago)

Console players are being held back by extremely low aim-assist.,"Before I get into this I want to clarify one thing.  Console FPS's need aim-assist to be playable.  It's not meant to give anyone any sort of advantage, or compensate for someones lack of skill.  You can still out-aim and out-play people despite there being aim-assist.  It's nothing but a physical necessity of console gaming.

If aim-assist is a 1-10 scale, Fortnite, COD, Halo, Titanfall are probably at a 5.  It makes the game fun and fluid on a controller, but you can 100% outplay someone by being better.  On this same scale, Apex is about a 1.  It's at the point where it's taking away from the fun i'm having in the game because I'm finding it incredibly frustrating to aim my weapon.  Most close-quarter fights are turning into random sprayfests because people can't hit their targets.  I'm seeing a lot of posts about the TTK being too long.  I think aim-assist is actually extending the TTK longer than intended because players are having trouble aiming, which in turn extends fights. 

I've been watching a ton of Apex streams lately and i'm noticing a trend.  Top PC players are consistently getting 10+ kills a game, while console players are not.  I think it's because the console community is not used to this low level of aim-assist, and it's holding them back mechanically.  Not only are they all learning a brand new game, but the aim system on controller is really holding them back.
 
I love Apex so far.  I've been playing Fortnite for over a year and you have no idea how nice it is to be playing another quality BR that I actually enjoy.  I'm sure i'm about to get shit on in the comments, but I really think Respawn should up the aim-assist a bit.  Nothing drastic.   Aim-assist is at it's best when you don't even notice it. In Apex however, it's a very noticeable handicap.",apexlegends,1549752308.0,t3_aoxq0g
The New Ranked System is a step in the right direction,"I can't tell you how much I'm enjoying the way the game is playing right now. It's so wonderful to be able to solo queue and not feel like I am doomed to lose 50RP.  On the old system, once you got to Plat thats exactly how it was. We could drop, I would squad wipe the first team by myself (with awful randoms) and then proceed to die a few minutes later and lose 55RP.  How was that fun?  How can you get to a rank you deserve under that system?  You can't. 

The matches also feel really good so far. They start slow as people try to secure at least a 10th place finish and then it ramps up really fast. On my teams, once we see 10th place it's balls to the walls and we push everything. Before, you would have a team wipe, be 10th, and still well into the negative. Then maybe get another team wipe, die at 6th place, and be +4. Like ok?  

At least this feels like some type of steady progression. Don't pay any attention to this NRG Sweet dude getting pred by ratting.  There was a lot more to it than that and it was Day 1.  A lot of the playerbase is not even engaged yet and probably won't be until the weekend. Also he was a pred before and a professional player so could be some MMR in there we don't know about.

Lack of Response Is Turning People Away,"I really enjoy Apex and have had a lot of fun over the past few weeks. But the lack of communication from Respawn has become very disconcerting. In today's environment, people want to know what's going on with a game and always on top of what's new. It builds discussions and community. Respawns lack of, at the very least addressing the upcoming battle pass is making people unsure with Apex. People think EA is causing it from the growth of the game or Respawn isn't ready for the game becoming so big. This is why  Respawn needs to communicate more, so people understand and not make up ideas that can turn others away.

I don't mind things being pushed back or changed as long as they communicate and explain what is going on. People will respect them more and enjoy what they have while they wait for what's new when it's ready. 

Edit: Thank You r/Doctorsl1m this is my point, the lack of communication has caused disconcertion and false info which has caused a decrease in interest in the game or people are waiting on the pass due to miss information.

Nostalgia is gatekeeping your enjoyment,"A lot of people complain about the game, but the most common thing I've seen everyone mention is that ""it used to be better"" or the ""back in my day this and that"".

I started playing again after a year long hiatus, since then SO MUCH has changed and for the BETTER. New maps, new modes, new legends, new QoL changes and my most favourite, CHANGING THE FIRING RANGE ITS SO GOOD NOW. This was a lot better than it was a year ago and im much more hyped to play again.

... so THERE IS a way to ban smurf accounts. But only if you want... If not you are EA and Respawn... DO IT LIKE VALVE!,"A main problem in Apex is smurfing. Really annoying and frustrating if you are a casual gamer.  
Many times Respawn and EA has claimed that it's impossible to ban smurf account or find them. Over the years, other gaming companies have found ways to reveal smurfs and ban them and im sure that also Respawn can easily understand smurfs.   
Many of you have seen in your lobbies 2-10-21-42 level players acting, moving and playing like pros. Nowdays its really hard to understand if a player of that level is a smurf or not.  


Lately, Valve has found a way to find and ban over 40.000 accounts and previously, on September, has banned over 90.000 accounts. 

The ΚΕΥ to this and to Discourage and PREVENT people to create smurf account is the FEAR of losing (ban) their main account also. So Valve not only banned the smurf account BUT ALSO THEIR MAIN ACCOUNTS...

Congratulations to Valve for taking those things seriously... If you care for your players you act like Valve. If you don't care and you like people to ruin your game you are called Respawn and EA.

People need to read this take on the current winter express situation,"I’ve said this in a lot of comments but I decided to make my own post about it. 

Winter Express may not be fun for you, but it is for a lot of people out there. If you don’t like it, don’t play it and keep your mouth shut and don’t shit on it. Plenty of people make this game mode a holiday tradition and it should be very understandable as to why we are upset about it not being here this year. 

Seriously, to all those who have complained about it in the past being “recycled” every year and did so much so that respawn took away, why? We get 2 weeks maybe 3 to play this LTM out the entire year. If you don’t like it, just don’t play it! Don’t ruin it for the people who look forward to this every year because you can’t stand seeing something in a game for 2-3 weeks that you don’t find as much enjoyment in as other people. 

And to all the people saying “why complain about it being here when you’re just going to complain again once they get rid of it?” It frightens me how you genuinely don’t seem to understand that these are two different sides of the community. The people in the past years who complained about it being here are not the same people who are upset that it isn’t here this year, there is a 100% certainty of that. Sure Respawn actually listened to the community and got rid of it, but like I said before, why ruin it for other people who obviously love it? I’d bet that all the people in this sub right now complaining about the amount of winter express posts right now are the same people who are responsible for having it taken away this year. If that’s the case and you’re reading this, I hope you realize how many people actually looked forward to this LTM coming out",apexlegends,1702412068.0,t3_18gv775

I honestly don't care if most players complaining about this game leave because for the most part you are the hardest to play with.,"Okay so let me preface this by saying I'm not trying to be rude. You are entitled to play the game however you want and I love that you enjoy the game, but some of you guys out there *need* to understand that your opinions are no more valid than anyone else's.

I have literally never seen the level of entitlement this community has in gaming and it's so frustrating. Imagine being respawn and spending 2+ years of your life trying to build something unique and then having people on reddit complain endlessly about things you can't fully control. Cheating and leavers are outside issues for the devs. They can't control behaviour and are trying so, so hard to make this game great. They're doing everything they can to balance it and make it a smooth experience.

Part of the issue here is that many of you complaining about the state of the game ate through the content far faster than you were ever intended to and then burped and asked for more then stormed into reddit and started screeching about how its a 'dead game' and suggesting endless balance changes that if implemented would likely break the game. That sounds bad but we have all seen the posts in this thread.

Guys were all here because we love apex. I seriously think that this sub would be better if people didn't post suggestions of fixes or changes unless they can actually discuss the changes in good detail instead of flooding the sub with ""fix wingman like dis or ded gaem"" 

Most of the players complaining want a more competitive experience or want to essentially play optimally. To you I say, find a team on this very site, roll in with them and clean up in a premade. Stop being mad at people who leave early (possibly due to any number of reasons, it's a game, play sessions can be interrupted) or are just worse than you. I'm so genuinely sick of getting flames for just playing the game. Not even doing anything weird or bad. Just for not being as good as the guy trying to go mlg. But the issue as I see it is that a massive portion of the community are like that as well which creates a very frustrating environment to relax in.

I really like this game and I really wish others could remember that not everyone is trying to stream a 20 drop and sometimes people want to use ""bad guns"" because they feel good (inject the p2020 and re45 into my veins, I love how they feel so much but I can never use them because they're both not optimal and I'm sick of the endless flames coming at me) 

Tl:Dr, please stop forcing this overly competitive mindset onto others who just want to enjoy the game. If you want to go pub stomping then do it in a premade and stop suggesting endless changes to reddit because respawn are damn good devs and know what they are doing.",apexlegends,1557358869.0,t3_bmcmj4

Apex Players Don't Know What Ranked Should Be,"In light of the new Apex Season 19 updates being released by creators. One of the big points of contention by casual players and some creators alike is the new rank up challenges needed to be completed to climb tiers (ie. Gold ->Plat, Plat -> Diamond). This along with the outrage and general complaints about how hard it was to rank up in season 18, I don't think Apex players have any idea what ranked is supposed to be nor the difficulty of putting in a ranked system for something like a BR. Let's break it down into topics so if you disagree, you can correctly address each one. 1. Your ranked experience should not be linear. 2. Apex's ranked system is far more difficult to design than any of you think it is. 3. Players need to be okay with not being as good as they think they are. 

***1.***   Your desired rank is not supposed to be reached by week 2. Ranked is supposed to take you all season long to reach your peak for the normal player. If anyone has played other games with a more defined or established ranked system, (League of Legends, Hearthstone, Overwatch), you'll know that it takes time to get to the rank you want. Lots of players end up a rank lower than they were the previous season because of the changes to the meta and their inability to adapt to it.

I understand that people have jobs and don't play the game for hours a day to be able to grind up to their desired rank in like a week like others. Good, play the game at your own pace in your own time and either improve to a degree to where you are so much better than the people in lower lobbies that you can consistently place top 5 with kills and your progress is much faster. Or realize that maybe the seasons where you were running it down constantly 3rd partying at any shot on the map to die in 14th with 6 kills wasn't supposed to reward you with fast progression.

 Apex players seem to have either an ego or entitlement to the rank they have, ""I was diamond last season, the map, the way points are calculated and meta changed, and now I'm gold. Respawn sucks and the ranked system is BS."" Respawn does suck and the ranked system has been really bad, but when the rules are clearly laid out for you and you refuse to change your play style, then it's on you. Is it boring for you to play zone and slowly to place higher so you'd rather just run and gun it down. Okay, but then be okay with the fact the current system doesn't reward it. Nor should it. 

As much as it gets meme'd, the winner is the last team alive, just like in games like League of Legends, the winner is who killed the nexus, not which team had the most kills. ""BUT I HAD 25 KILLS AND WIPED 8 SQUADS."" Cool, and then you played stupid, solo swung a rampart team, got melted and died in 11th, so you didn't win by the game's standards.  Now you still get points and maybe some advancement in your ranked journey but you definitely shouldn't be rewarded and encouraged to play like placement doesn't matter. Just like it taught the 8 teams you wiped that fighting is important and even if they had amazing position and zone control, if they can't shoot their guns. They still lose the game.

***2*****.**  This is going to seem like I'm walking back on my point but hear me out. Ranked in a BR is far harder to calculate a ""win"" than any other genre of game. Fighting games, I lower your health bar to 0 before you, I win. MOBAS, I break your base before you break mine, I win. Overwatch, I get the point, I push the payload better or farther than you, I win. (I understand there are possibilities of ties, not important for this context) These games have clear binary win conditions, One team wins. One Team loses. You are only thinking about 2 sets of participants with 2 possible outcomes. 

Now, how do you define these outcomes for 20 teams of 3, in an RNG based setting. Is it kills? Then it's just a giant TDM map. Is it placement? Than you have people ratting and hiding the whole game not participating. So you need to strike up a balance between the two while also balancing the gameplay and abilities and the guns. It's not as easy as, ""Give me points for shooting enemy."" We saw what happened in Season 15 when kills were given too much leverage and then we saw what happened in Season 17 when ratting was encouraged. Season 18 was the closest I ever felt to a decent balance between the two that also encouraged player retention throughout the season.

3. This leads to my next point. Apex players seem to think that you should reach your peak rank in a short period of time. Ranked is supposed to be time consuming, it's supposed to test you and push you to be better. Not everyone can be masters, unless it's season 17. I know it sucks when you feel like you've regressed or you're not where you were previously, personally I think it sucks being handed something I didn't earn. If you are pushing and trying to improve, your progress is going to go up as you hone skills, go down as you try new things and plateau when you've reached your mental blocks. All at the same time that everyone else is also improving.

&#x200B;

To wrap things up. I don't know if season 19 changes to ranked are going to be good or not, but I'd rather have something be changed to stop the ratting meta while still encouraging placement and improvement than nothing at all.

Unpopular opinion: Apex is fine.,"Seems like all I see are complaints about a ""lack of content"". Personally, I'm having a blast! I'll grant you this, Apex is my first BR, so maybe I'm just a scrub that likes doing space magic and punching supply boxes (screw gravity!), But adding in more cosmetics won't make the game more fun for me. I like the 3 man teams, though I wouldn't mind quads (for that poor sap always left out from his friends), and solos would be a great way to get rid of ""those people"" (shudders). Ok, fine, duos would be cool too.

Apex Legends is garbage. [Xbox one],"This game is genuinely just so bad.

The concept is great, some of the ideas are amazing but the game itself is genuinely just so bad and player unfriendly.


Let's start with matchmaking, It's dogshit.

Ranked is decent but it's not great, I'm bronze and I regularly get diamond players in my games, occasionally higher, usually as the champions.

Pubs are a monstrosity of horrible matchmaking, especially in event modes like control & gun run.

At level 10 I had gotten matched against the top 17 pred in my region in a pubs match, that's just braindead levels of bad.

I have single digits number of wins over hundreds or maybe over a thousand games, and I would be fine with that if the game was at least enjoyable in the meantime.

The average match consists of landing. not seeing anyone, dying out of nowhere to people playing like they are sojourn from overwatch and looking at that juicy masters or pred icon on their profile as you see your 0 damage.


Now the servers.

They are a fucking mess.

I've had countless occasions where I literally run into a room, go to grab a item or something, and I'm instantly back outside. Before you ask, yes I have very good internet.


Constant lag issues cause the games to feel incredibly unresponsive in every way, which ruins every gunfight, rollout, and more.


Third Partying

At this point it almost feels like it's the meta to wait until there's a firefight and sneak up on the winning team to wipe them the second they win.

The Hit Registration.

Certain weapons are fine, most smgs and LMGs feel pretty responsive.

Snipers are 50/50, sometimes they are spot on other times it feels like no matter how accurate you are the shots just won't register.

Shotguns are dependent. 

Eva 8 is a beast
Mozambique has good reg
Peacekeeper will guarantee you miss any shot you hit, and vice versa
Mastiff just feels pathetic?? Even at point blank it feels like most smgs just wipe this thing.

The Movement.

I love what they tried to do with the movement but they did it so damn badly, the network issues make a lot of movement just not work altogether half the time, you can hit the tiniest rock and all your momentum is gone.

And some of the movement techs in this game are just out of hand, the ability to bhop at the speed of sounds with octane using binds and shit is just braindead and makes high *""skill""* players fucking impossible to kill alone

Xims Strikepacks & More

These make console a unplayable mess, everyone and their mother has some shit to give them no recoil on a flatline or fucking scripts to cosplay Goku using afterimage as a octane with bhops

Aim Assist

Please shut up about this being OP,  it's really not.

Limited Time Modes.

Modes like control, gun run & more should have a special mode slot where they cycle, be it weekly or daily. The game is far too repetitive with it's TWO modes.

Legends & Their Paywalls

This is my BIGGEST issue with the game as a whole, I think that the concept of putting the characters behind walls like this a shitty idea in my opinion, but I could deal with that if it wasn't such a pain in the ass to get new ones. For a game with a ever changing meta, nerfs to some heroes and buffs to others, teammates who could pick your planned legend and more the concept of only being able to get ONE new legend every 24 or so levels is HORRIBLE. Sure you maybe able to level those first 2 or 3 characters pretty fast, but after that it starts taking so long that the games honestly just gets boringly repetitive.

Minor Criticisms

Why the hell are LMG mags so small? This triggers me.

Why don't you just give console M&K support? That'll kill most strikepacks and XIMS as that's all people want.

Why is your game fucking 360p on Xbox???

Why is Bangalore smoke 100% useless and everybody can beam you through it with zero effort required? Almost like people found a way to remove it's texture.

All in all this game feels like a great concept that went terribly wrong, it feels like they either went over the top on everything, or didn't bother doing more then the bare minimum.",apexlegends,1674537500.0,t3_10jxz5n

The real reason Arenas discontinued…,"Wish I could post a poll… how many people miss Arenas? Arenas was very underrated in my opinion. Not only was it a phenomenal way to warm up but it also allowed you to test abilities and specific team fighting dynamics without waiting times or losing LP. Especially being able to play on actual POIs and get “real BR testing” out of it. So many great memories too. I would much rather play Arenas when I’m bored with BR than mixtape… and the ranked grind was actually fun (very brutal in the beginning though). 

Once the OG devs left, they simply based their decision to pull the mode based on numbers and that makes sense from a financial perspective but I think they messed up from the get go by having a pub mode and a ranked mode. They should’ve kept it to one or the other if they wanted a bigger draw. If I knew how to create a petition to bring it back, I would… but if they do they definitely need to keep it simple by having one mode of Arenas and only use existing POIs.

If you don't want to buy the skin, don't. There are hundreds of free cosmetics and probably more free ones to come in the future. If you're willing to fork out the money, great, see it as you donating to an amazing dev team and getting a nice free skin out of the deal.

Smurfing: A data-based and observational take on the biggest problem in Apex Legends,"**Disclaimer**: This is going to be long. Please do give it a read. Yes, I know I'm part of the problem ""technically"", but if you read it, I hope you understand the why and can garner at least some information from this and realise the actual magnitude of this issue. 

Smurfing is the biggest problem in Apex Legends. ""But it's the matchmaking!"", ""But the audio!"", ""But broken legends!"", ""Bad servers!"". You're wrong. Smurfing is the biggest and least dealt with problem in the entire game, period. End of story. I'll tell you why. 

I created my first smurf account as a way to play with my brother. He was new-ish to gaming and *definitely* new to PvP gaming. I wanted him to have a good time and not get one-clipped immediately in every encounter the same way I do in every game playing on my main account. He'd quit after 3 matches if that was the case. I had heard that smurfing was a way of not having him play the masters and preds that I play day in day out, thought I'd give it a shot. He lives 8 hours away and I don't talk to him often, this was my way of spending time with him. That was 9 months ago. 

I expected when I got in there to absolutely melt everyone. I'm a high Plat/Diamond player. I kinda felt bad, but whatever. Wouldn't be for long. I was showing my brother how to play in firing range, the attachments etc... And we got into a match. Teaching him how to play live, I got killed a bunch trying to save him. But then after a few matches, I noticed something... Why is a level 4 Bangalore tap strafing? Why are all 3 of those guys tap strafing and wall bouncing? How do they have amazing game sense? Oh.. They're Smurfs. Whatever, so am I. Next game, same thing. And the next... And the next... Some times I'd beat them, the whole 3 stack of Smurfs, sometimes I wouldn't. 

We're going to jump around a little bit here... 

I know my way around smurfing. I have 350-400 smurf accounts. First problem: it's too fucking easy to make them. I can have a smurf created, trained and in-game in less than 5 minutes. 3-stack? Yeah, there's a bug with that. Less than 5 minutes. They tried this season to make it take longer with their stupid mirage intro but there's a bug with that too. Still less than 5 minutes. The training has some anti-smurf built-in but it's so hilariously rudimentary that I scripted the entire thing. I don't even have to be at my computer during the entire process of running that training. I can get a drink, grab a snack, fold some laundry or otherwise generally be productive while that script is running. I just have to set up the account. In total, I'm at my PC for 45 seconds of those 5 minutes. 

With playing with my brother and getting wrecked continuously on new accounts, I got curious. I'm a data guy. So I started a spreadsheet. I kept track of every account I created, when I died and how, and if I knew my killer or the squad was an obvious smurf. If I wasnt sure, I counted it as a no. The more accounts I created, I started keeping more in depth stats: 

* ""Smurf"" in the name
* Champ squad obviously smurfing
* Champ squad 3 stack smurfing
* Another smurf on my team
* No-fill smurfs
* Aim bots
* TTV players smurfing openly on Twitch 

Etc... 

With that many accounts created, I noticed a lot of things about the way this game works with it's matchmaking, especially for ""new"" players. Firstly, whether you want to admit it or not, pubs has matchmaking. From what I noted, there are 3 or so ""tiers"" to the matching system in pubs that, if you're actually new, works basically on a linear progression. All of the following assumes no smurfs in lobbies at all. 

The first is the new player lobbies. It's the umbrella that new players get put into that shields them from playing against people who know the game. They're bot lobbies. This is where you go when you're level 1. If you progress somewhat normally, you'll make it out of these lobbies around level 20 or 30. If you're really bad maybe 40-50. You'll be in the next tier which encapsulates people of this relative skill. From what I've seen, these lobbies run anywhere from level 30s to really low skill levels 200-250. Anything after this, you're in the everyone lobbies. Typically, time-in will get you out of that second tier regardless of skill by around 250. If you haven't gotten better by this point...I mean... Good luck. It's really hard to get better when you can't land without dying. Your account is unplayable now. 

You cannot drop to easier lobbies once you've gone up no matter how poorly you do, save for very few exceptions. 

Your skill and how your games pan out is what determines how quickly you jump to the everyone lobbies. Here's a few scatter-brained notes, since I'm not sure how to present the information. 

Start scatter brained information -- 

Being the kill leader or having high kills in your first few games is a sure fire way to get put into the highest tier very quickly. If you're the kill leader or have high kills in your first game on a new account AND you win the game you can kiss that smurf goodbye. One really good game with a win in your first 2-3 games is all it takes. If you're smurfing, it is in your best interest not to win your first game. I've seen a full 3-stack smurf squad purposely throw a 3v1 against, almost-literally, a watermelon lifeline because they knew their smurfs would be blown. It was sad. 

The longer you go without winning and without high kill or kill leader games, the more chance you have at keeping yourself in the lower tier umbrella lobbies. For example, if you play 10 games and you get killed a whole bunch with low kills in the first 9 and then get a 15 kill, kill leader win on your 10th, you'll still be in the lower lobbies. Sample size seems to matter. However, if you string together a bunch of kill leader wins, you'll go up. 

If you're in a 3 stack smurf, it will bring you to lobbies of your most skilled player (same as ranked). So, for example, when I played with my brother and he started staying alive for a little longer, I got way more kills because I didn't have to risk my life for him. With that said, I'd get 10+ kills and a win a few times and we'd get jumped right into master's lobbies. I create a new smurf, back down we go. My brother's account was safe. 

As I played on with the stats I kept I started putting the numbers together with some formulas. I stopped keeping track of my stats after about 80 accounts because it's really, really bad. Nevertheless, some interesting information comes to light: 

\~60% of my deaths in lowest-tier lobbies were to another smurf. Of those 60%, \~85% of those were a *for sure* 3-stack. Some were not; there were many I marked ""no"" because I was not 100% sure. 

In games where the champ squad was smurfing, that squad contained the kill leader \~95% of the time. 

I only ever, in 400+ accounts, have squadded with another smurf at random ***four times***. I've never randomed into a duo. This lends itself to prove that any time someone is smurfing, they're looking to stomp entire lobbies repeatedly.

All of this data accounts only for the times I was eliminated (except champ squad). 

\-- End scatter brained information

If I'm being honest, smurfing actually made me better at Apex. My main account is unplayable, but on a smurf I was able to land without dying in the first 30-60 seconds or to the first fight every single time. As mentioned, I stopped keeping track after around 80 accounts because as I improved, I noticed that almost literally every single first-tier lobby has at least one 3 stack smurf in it (many have considerably more) and they're wiping the floor with everyone. It was pointless to track because I had my answer. 

I have a few more observations so, if you're still reading this far: thank you. If you're going to judge me and throw me a ""git gud noob"", I mean... That's fine too but, in all reality, you're turning a blind eye. I can live with it if you can. 

**Further observations**: 

I have played on my main a bunch more this season and last to grind ranked with a few friends. The smurfing scene in this new ranked ecosystem is *egregious*. I'm gonna give it to you straight: people don't give a single squirt of purple pony piss about winning the game. They want kills and nothing else. I'm consistently seeing players in my lobbies at level 40 or 50 with over a thousand kills on one legend and their squadmates are about average for the rank. They're boosting. I'm seeing players whose whole sqauds are comprised of level 40-50 players with the typical smurf badges (combination of: pride, hot streak, rapid elimination, no witnesses, squad wipe, or apex predator) or a 4k/20 and like 800 kills each. The kill leaders in most of my ranked games (usually who I die to) have at least ten. Players do not want to sit there and rat the whole game away just to try and place for rank. Just yesterday, a very high-profile streamer was streaming ""Bronze to Master in one stream"". He was dropping 20 in Plat/Diamond lobbies. We're okay with this? Respawn is okay with this? 

I keep track in my head now as I continue smurfing but the data doesn't lie. Quite literally every lobby is smurfed into the ground. If you're asking why I continue to smurf, and will continue to smurf until this problem is at least somewhat addressed or even acknowledged is very simple: Why play my main, which is unplayable, where almost every player in my lobby is going to crush me and my squad, random or not, in both ranked and pubs in the first fight when I can, in 5 minutes or less, be on another account where only about half the lobby will do the same? At least I get more than one kill per night on a smurf.

And then you wonder why new players don't join Apex.

Fix. The. Problem.

**Edit:** Oh yeah. I forgot to include this... There is no way in hell the chances of getting an Heirloom are 1 in 500. I have 400+ accounts. I have never missed opening a single box and, on average before the account is screwed, I get about 10-15 packs per account. Say 12 for average. I have opened roughly 4800 packs on smurf accounts and have never gotten one other than the freebie on my main. Either my luck is the hottest, spiciest most-salted garbage known to man, or 1 in 500 is a load of crap. The math doesn't work.

"i know i’m gonna get a lot of hate for this, but i absolutely love apex right now (ranked especially)","I haven’t played any pubs this season and strictly ranked but i freaking love it. 

no legend is feeling op and i’m not feeling frustrated when i come across any specific legend. 

no gun is feeling op to me and things feel more balanced. im also definitely enjoying the alternator being a thing again especially with disruptors. 

i’m not getting absolutely steamrolled by preds and all the masters are fake masters anyway so encounters are feeling way more balanced and i’m very very rarely just getting absolutely smacked by someone, so it’s feeling great. 

map rotations are chef’s kiss. 

and last controversial opinion, but i love that ranked is a slow climb up. you’re getting like max 300 something rp from a high kill+win game and normal games are like 100 rp. i personally love that it feels like it’s gonna take actual time to rank up and not a week to get back to where you were. it makes me feel invested in the game. 

i know there’s plenty who disagree with me, but this is probably the happiest i’ve been with apex and i freaking LOVE this season. well done, devs. well done.",apexlegends,1691980768.0,t3_15qhz44
Why are you so obsessed with loot?,"Look, I don't mean to just drop, pick one mag and push but... I just honestly can't comprehend why people want to loot so hard. No matter how stacked we are, how many fights we have gone through, how many other players' boxes we have looted, YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO STOP BY A BUILDING AND CHECK IT. Why? Why is that? Why do you want to spend more time on looting rather than fighting other players? Why do you believe that purple stock will make you win more than a blue stock? Why, when you hear a gunfight, instead of trying to get some fun, you rather choose to run to a damn chest that is 200 meters away in opposite direction to the gunfight? 

Just to be clear - I'm not the kind of player who picks a P2020 and starts pushing, but on the other hand, I don't need a golden r-301 every game unlike players who seem to be looking for a specific attachment to even consider pushing... If you are pushing without bats and ammo, you are trolling, but when your gun is blue, you have enough ammo and meds, and yet you're still stopping every single push because you need purple mag, you are the troll.

Season 16 Ranked Is Awful,This seasons ranked system is so bad. Let me start off by saying that the boosting this season is out of hand but that’s not what I’m here to talk about. First of all why is it that you gain 1rp per kp that you have and it will only go up the more placement you have. It’s rewarding players who camp and just wait till the end to fight. Let’s also talk about this awful entry fee and point gap between ranked divisions. Why is is so much entry fee and why are the divisions so far apart. See I know they made the gap further because the cap on kp is now unlimited but that doesn’t really matter when kp only counts for 1 point and the entry fees nearly double. Diamond lobbies aren’t even a thing it’s just pred lobbies because all the other preds are off boosting leaving us to have to play with the actual preds. Not to mention why hasn’t apex added a duo ranked or solo ranked that would just keep the same rank through each one. Like it would help solo players or duo players and there’s nothing wrong with it. But instead we have to rely on teammates who don’t even know what planet they are on. I hate how no one is talking about this and how this season is so bad and just enjoyable in terms of ranked.,apexlegends,1679803900.0,t3_122alt1

"(Some)Adults in Apex that qeue solo, should be ashamed.","I qeue solo most of the time.

Mostly because I dont want to look for a team and not know how much time I actually would be on for.
I must say, I run into a lot of oblivious players, and just those that want to do their own thing, approximately 90%-100% of the time. 

You try to coordinate an attack, and they'll just continue to rush in head-on, or be loot goblins. 

Today, I queued solo;

And I run into a squad, that actually listens, and stay together. Although one would be distracted with loot, more often than he should. 

We win our match and group up, again. To find out the one who grabbed the game winning kill last game, is a kid. Probably around 11 or 12, I'm assuming.

I tell this kid to pop a smoke on one of the houses in river center where a team was camping out on, so we can then rush them, and clean them up. And HE ACTUALLY DOES IT!! He missed a little, hitting the back side of the house, but hey, the kid did it.

If I tried this with any other random, they most likely would have just rushed the house head first.

Anyways, I thought it was cool that this kid coordinated with me.",apexlegends,1563113384.0,t3_cd3eoe

Fix pubs by awarding an Apex Pack for being the Champion🏆,"The pubs experience is a disaster. There needs to be more incentive to get 1st place. The solution is to award high placements or even just 1st place. No one cares enough about the experience earned to go for Champion instead of dropping hot and fighting. There has to be a tangible reason to want to be the champion, instead of just wanting kills, much like the direction being taken in ranked matches. As someone who consistently pushes past platinum and has friends who are much more casual, it feels awful playing pubs with them. These games are over before round 3, and it feels awful pushing in with only 3 squads left when there would be 15 in ranked matches.

So what do we do? Do I smurf? (F#%$ Smurfing) Should we just not play together while they play ranked and catch up while I sit and wait? How am I supposed to even help them get better when the casual experience is so far and away different from the ranked experience? I love Apex, and I think the direction with ranked matches is great. We should have better end games with more teams fighting tooth and nail for 1st place. But it all starts in pubs, and no one cares about getting first place in pubs.

If you aren't going to introduce ranked duos (why is this not a thing?) or solos, then can we, at the very least, make the experience I have with my more casual friends better? Heavily incentivizing winning is the only solution here. What are we going to do, Respawn, in order to ensure the prosperity of THE BEST shooter on the market, instead of continuing its fragmentation?

Respawn are just laughing at us,"Am I the only one disgusted by the recent respawn post, It was the most dishonest thing I've ever heard from any dev on any game

How can you be okay with what was said .... it's just a stupid plea for the lack of work they are putting for their game ...

and I am not hating on them, I heavily support them but man this was ugly, so I'll summarize what they said with no double talk. 

""50 million players is a lot for a small studio like us we have been overwhelmed but hey we will not talk about the fact that we have earned more then 100million dollars that we could invest in growing the team, hiring new members to fix the bugs, servers,cheater and so on but no we prefer waiting 3months only to fix crashes that make the game unplayable, 3month to drop one sandbox uptade that is complete garbage but hey we don't even play the game so we will just try small patches every 3month and maybe in 2years when the game will be dead we will have a well balanced meta""

&#x200B;

""The beginning of each season wich is by the way every 3months we will release one weapon, one legend and a small miserable patch so every dedicated player out there can go screw themselves""

&#x200B;

"" We are sorry for the lack of communication by the team but hey we had nothing to communicate about, we plan on updating the game every 3month ""

&#x200B;

"" At EA PLAY in june you will learn about wattson, the L-Star that had been leaked since the launch of the game but hey who knows it can still be a surprise for some ...""

And this is the funniest comment of them all :  ""We designed Apex Legends with a long-term core competitive identity "".

Anyone else just losing interest in Apex due to lack of meaningful updates and constant crashes?,"Every time I think of stuttering the words ""hey wanna play some apex"" to my friends I think to my self ""hmm... actually the chances of one of us getting kicked out of the game randomly is too high and we'll probably get pissed off, never mind.""

I know Respawn said ""March"" for the battle pass update, but it feels like we're going to be in late March, next week at the earliest until we see something new. The one thing that turns me off from these ""class"" based shooters is the lack of updates and new legends, we've seen via leaks what they've been prototyping and that they've got shit under the hood in store, I just don't want this to turn out to be another Overwatch esq game where I'm advertised to be able to sift through a selection of Legends but only 1 or 2 get released per year.

These type of games should be trying to pump out new legends as soon as they can to get out as many as they can as soon as possible. Take Riot Games for example, in their early years they were dropping new champions every 2 weeks to get the champion selection pool up to par with other games, this is the type of approach Respawn should be looking at and trying to achieve. (Not necessarily every 2 weeks should there be a new Legend, but there should be more frequent changes to the game, additions to the map, shifting of locations and re-deploy balloons...etc etc)

I really enjoyed this game, a lot but none of my friends are playing anymore because of all the issues above, we're always threatened with the fact that at any moment any of us can get boop'd out of a game, sometimes it's a crash, sometimes we get an invite from a 3rd party and the game auto accepts it, sometimes we just get a party leader timeout message and get sent to lobby, sometimes we join up in a game and the 3rd person doesn't make it into the Legend Selection screen.

This is just one of those games where I guess we'll revisit in a year or so and see how Respawn has handled everything...

EDIT: **The problem with Apex isn't that it crashes every so often or that the Legends aren't coming as soon as we hoped, its the lack of a Progression system. We as players once we hit 100 cannot do anything else, we're not rewarded any differently and we feel no progression whatsoever.**

**There needs to be a competitive queue separate from the normal queue. There needs to be a ranked ladder wherein ranks exist for how well you play on average, there needs to be progression past level 100, and hopefully rewards for playing more than the average player.**


EDIT#2:

An example of how Respawns communication or a lackthereof is put to comparison with another game developer studio and subreddit, [Path of exile has a Developer communications tracker.](https://gggtracker.com/)

I think respawn sould give some kind of reward for the old fans of the series,"Most of you might not know but Apex Legends is actually part of a video game series called Titanfall. Titanfall 2 especially is one of the best FPS of this generation, it has a great single-player campaign and a really fun online multiplayer mode. It also had no season pass and no loot boxes. When this game came out back in 2016 it received lots of praise from critics and gamers alike. However it sold very poorly , because it came out in between Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Me and a small community of fans tried to keep this game alive, but nowadays its hard to find a single server to play.

When Apex Legends came out I was super exited to see that this great franchise was finnaly getting the recognition that it deserved. I would greatly apreciate if respawn could give some kind of reward to the veterans of the series, like a  character skin, a calling card, or something else.

"Holy crow, my opinion on a game has never changed so much","And not in a good way. Here are my takeaways on the start of Season 3 so far.

- The look distributiom of the drop... It is downright terrible. Every game I drop with an Eva, an Alternator, a P2020, a Mozambique, or a G7. This isn't even being biased and annoyed (which I'm very annoyed).

- What the hell man... WHERE ARE THE FREAKING HEALS??? I can find white shield off the drop, get hit twice by a triple take, and search a WHOLE AREA and not even find two shield cells and two syringes.

- What is this map??? I can't even believe it. The high ground to low ground distance and ratio is so bad, it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to win a fight with low ground on this map. Oh great, a whole squad on high ground can easily win a fight, and me, a pathfinder main can get lasered while being the only one to grapple up (without having my ultimate) and get lasered by the entire team in the process, and then maybe down one guy before getting shredded, only to have my team get fucked and me have no option for a revive.

- Did I miss where gold body shields were more common then grey? Because seemingly everyone has one. Every time.

- There in general isn't even enough loot to go around. Not as many place to drop. Seemingly not enough loot to open. Even if it is, it's all the same shit you already have (see above).

I'm just disappointed. I had over 130+ season two wins. That's not meant to be a brag, because there are MANY others higher than me, but rather, that's to show how much I've played the damn game. Enough to know how fucking terrible this season is right now. I hate this shit more than it's other overly popular battle royale rival. And I fucking hated that shit more than you can imagine.

Edit: I would just like to add that I don't dislike change. Change is good. Change is fresh. The quality of life changes I feel are great. Funnily enough, I primarily used the R99 and Longbow, both of which got decent nerfs. And I even agree with them. Even disruptors rounds, while annoying, were tolerable. This season...

"Dear Respawn, please decrease the time between rounds. There is so much downtime now that everybody has gotten better at the game.","In the first two weeks of the game, squads were living longer. Now that players are becoming more efficient in their hunting and killing, there seems to be a massive amount of downtime between rounds (ring closures), especially rounds 3+.

It is becoming increasingly common to have only 6 or 7 squads left before the first ring closes, resulting in a 12 minute game of hide and seek combined with 5 minutes of fighting. Watching a stream featuring NRG's Dizzy and King Richard, even they were commenting on how long it took to find the final squads with such a massive ring. I don't believe this is an issue that's limited to the ""elite"" of this game. I'm only a slightly-above-average fraggger and even my friends and I end up just running around in circles waiting for the ring to close until we find another squad.  


I think decreasing the time between ring closures is the best way to increase game pace, but could be wrong. I'm interested to see what the community thinks, or if you guys even see this as an issue.

You see, it's easy to say BLM when there's nothing to lose. Would EA/Respawn dare to bring up more serious events that are happening around the world? They'd risk that sweet Chinese market money. But shouldn't one act what they preach?

Ranked Kings Canyon is more fun than ranked Storm point," I have have always loved this map and having fun now as well.

I personally think u have to play smart on kings canyon(in ranked). I have been having fun mostly if I time the movement of ring correctly and have good positioning. Many childish or less experienced players don't have that sense of positioning and just want to charge in.

One thing I agree is that it is very easy to spot where the fight is happening. That's why the 3rd party issue that's why u have to play smartly.

2 placed needs to be addressed. The area between cage and market. And the second would be the area near containment. Changing these will address pro players concerns.

Every map have different approach in my opinion. I just hate the foliage(grass and trees) in storm point. World's edge is great tbh if u don't hot drop to fragment. Olympus is also very y balanced imo.",apexlegends,1661426388.0,t3_wxbi7n

So when is the horizon nerf coming?,"I'm diamond and she's basically in every squad at this point, if you're not running her as skirmisher it feels like you might as well be throwing due to how much stronger she is currently. As a Wraith main I feel like even I have struggles compete with this brain dead legend that is an easy crutch pick.

Q needs 1.5-2 sec delay before start up so it's not a free reset or instant route to high ground as well as removing the ability to heal or slow down the speed you go up and Passive need to not make her silent when falling.

Kind of ridiculous that this legend has a 20.1% pick rate in Masters/Pred and a 16% pick rate in diamond and is the most picked legend in any rank that isn't bronze. I do think Bangalore and Catalyst are arguably a much bigger issue in the current meta but it's pretty clear that Horizon is pretty overtuned at the moment.",apexlegends,1694572023.0,t3_16haswt

Apex Events are Garbage.,"So, I love Apex as a game, and I’ve been playing the event since it dropped and all I have to say is that it’s garbage. I’m not speaking about Control. I’m speaking about how there is no way to get the even packs for free. It’s nothing more than a cash grab. If you didn’t save up your crafting you’re shit out of luck. It’s would be pretty nice if the devs would have added challenges towards EARNING crafting materials for the event itself. But hey, I’m just the average guy who can’t afford to spend 200 dollars on a video game. I know I’m not alone on this and I don’t want people to think I’m hating on the game because I’ve been playing it daily since season 12.. just wish they would allow us an easier means of progressing through the event rather than money and luck.",apexlegends,1655840372.0,t3_vhlmp7

Am i the only one who isn't upset with the SBMM?," 

i feel as if i'm the only person who isn't at all upset by this SBMM. I'm actually enjoying it because now i'm not getting shot down in the first ring anymore, unless i drop where 3 other squads drop and i'm unlucky enough to not find a weapon. It sucks that if my squad dies they leave instantly and i think that's what is making it hard for me to get the W. But i no longer have preds or diamonds stomping my lobby and getting high kill games. I no longer have the innate fear of hearing their launch and watching their tails as they land in my game.

i feel as if i'm getting better. I went from having 0-2 kills per game to 5-7 per game. i'm learning more about the game sense and what i think my squad would be better off doing vs just running aimlessly. i feel like i have a fight chance in my pub lobbies now.

and i'm a casual player. i don't really like doing ranked because i'm against rank systems. but when i was constantly put in games with preds and diamonds who reveled in stomping me and my buddies back in season 2... well, i stopped playing this game. i found it annoying to constantly being hunted and killed by thirsty for 20 bomb game preds because i was a ""bot"". and being made fun of for being a ""bot"". now my friends and i can play together with almost no fear of having a highly skilled player stomping us for fun. now we have a chance to learn the game and possibly, one day, find them again in the higher skilled matchmaking and try to get revenge.",apexlegends,1575967110.0,t3_e8o2rq
Can we stop the SBMM crybaby posts?,"Seriously, all i see is people complaining about the game not being fun anymore because the casual play is as ""sweaty"" as ranked, cut that shit off, im a diamond ll player and while in ranked matches there are 12/8 squads in the 3rd/4th circle in social matches half of the lobby is dead by the 2nd ring lol.

Also for new players is better to be match up with new players too, it won't be fun to play against silver/gold/platinum (where most of the playerbase is) if you are still learning what the game is about.

In casual matches it doesn't matter if you win or you lose, is that type of matches where you try a 1v3 in the most stupid way because you know that nobody care if you pull it off or no and because ypu don't need to care about placement and make it as far as you can in the leaderboard.

The casual game isn't sweaty, you are the ones that take too serious non-ranked games and the ones that want to go againsts lower levels so you can feel better about not playing that good in ranked, the system should remain the same, stop crying about not being able to stomp noobs.",apexlegends,1574814812.0,t3_e27mc9
Apex Season 3 - Not Enjoyable,"No idea how anyone can enjoy this trash game....

Cannot see shit, bloom every where on this trash new map, loot is gawd awful, hit-boxes are wack, hit reg is still off at times, rank has a horrible time out feature when teammates just abandon you, the sensitivity settings are not universal like every other game but by ""gun"" regardless of scope settings.

Complete trash.",apexlegends,1570266379.0,t3_ddkv6n
"Apex legends has serious problems, but it's not the game, it's the players.","I'm almost level 100. I have yet to encounter a single bug. Only issue server wise I've seen is sometimes you'll move in slow motion when the game first starts.   


Never seen an issue with ""hit reg"" that I couldn't attribute to better aim and considering how human beings act like they are divine beings, I can safely guess they just missed. I've seen both situations where I empty a r-99 mag, miss every shot and empty a r-99 mag, hit every shot.   


75% of games with rando are started and ended within 3 minutes because you can almost hear the impatient peasants of 10 teams with their free game mashing jump as soon as they are able. Then you have a RNG chance of getting the right guns to win your initial fight after fighting over 1 gun with three people from three different teams only to be killed by a smarter team who jumped somewhere they can loot first. When I queue up with my brother and our friend, we nearly always get top 3 with a good chance of winning. That's just communication and finding the right fights without some guy running away from your team, running into Skull Town, dying immediately to a team he tried to take on then leave. Also it's nice not to be raged at for entering a house with somebody after we both already spent time looting an area in the game.  


Well, since everybody immediate drops, half the server is gone within 5 minutes of a game that could last 15. So you spent 10 minutes running around fighting nothing until you literally just run to the other side of the map which is now too large. Crazy to think about but the Apex map is too large for how this player base wants to play.  


Players in this game cheat. You can blame Respawn, but that is an issue with people. If people had honor, they wouldn't cheat.   


Maybe in a year or two, this game may be playable with randoms. When people get over the immediate drops. I don't mind hotdrops like Market but immediate drops into Airbase which has piss poor loot for such a massive area make me not want to play this game and why would I spend money on a game I don't want to play but a few times I can get my friends schedules to meet up.   


People are going to get real mad at my words but this isn't for those peasants. This game came out quite polished and it runs very well. IF my aim is actually on point I can easily take out a no lifer virgin with 5k kills. If not then I get stomped. Oh well GG.  


Every single game with randos in Apex is like dropping Paradise or Pochinki unless I'm jumpmaster. Even when I'm jumpmaster and want to take them a little farther than the first option once the countdown ends, you'll always get that guy who spam pings Airbase over and over and sometimes they'll just solo drop wherever once you didn't leave the dropship immediately.  


This game has so little issues that I have a hard time blaming Respawn for anything other than better anti-cheat protection. It's the awful player base. In fact here's a bunch of them about to bitch that it's the game not the players and to get a squad together.

Why i quit after being killed straight away. Its not personal.,"I know this is gonna get dowvoted, but i feel its important to be honest to my fellow team-mates.
So, right now- I wanna win..
I wanna give myself the BEST chance to win i can, But..
The problem is its not efficient to play on, especially if im respawned no where near my deathbox.
The chance of me getting back in the game is slim, the chance of winning the game is next to none. 
I dont like them odds.
If im revived, then yeah ill play on.. If im killed then im gonna see the number of variables infront of me before i choose wether or not to play on.
If im killed and my loot get stolen by a team mate before respawning me, then im gonna quit.
Because by the time i try and get that loot back, im more than likely gonna get shot unshielded after i get hit once with charge rifle from miles away after they hear the dropship come knocking..
If im respawned in the next ring miles from my deathbox, then im more than likely gonna quit because im probably gonna be up against a purp shield when i fall from the ship, and no matter how good i am, its not worth the time to wait for the next ring before i drop into certain death.
The odds have changed against me.

Theres also the risk that if my team-mate comes up against even a team of two, the chance of him now being able to win against them is ridiculously low.

Before this season, id wait for the respawn, because even with a blue shield, i had a chance.
But now i dont.
And its incredibly more efficient to just not waste my time waiting for a respawn that more than likely wont happen.

Its MORE efficient, to restart the game, and try again hoping that my loot drop is a bit better, i start in a better place and ill have a better run against the new enemies, who might be slight easier to overcome on the next round. Meaning my shield get charged.

Unless the games 'Value per Time' increases. Imma gonna quit.
Because by letting you die sooner, means you get another chance at a win on the next round sooner, and i feel this is better for the game.

Its happening even more now especially and unbelievably in ranked games, and if im the last in my squad unless i have a charge rifle and i see only one enemy left, then i actually just stay in the game on my own, and when it does, all i do is wait in a corner till im the last 2 squad, then walk into the ring singing my national anthem.
Its not worth the fight to enter into a 20 second battle, when i can get more XP from chilling in the corner.

Im not gonna play a game that doesnt reward my time.

I would love an honest and open discussion about this but i fear ill only start a hate war.",apexlegends,1598385318.0,t3_igjpzp

"Apex community, be better!!!","I don't know about you guys but when I play this game, it gives me an adrenaline rush like no other br. The movement, graphics, guns etc feels way better and not to forget the time to kill is the best thing because you can actually survive compared to other br games. There so many things a player can do in a battle like the armor swaps to prepare for a third party. The abilities as well to out maneuver your opponent makes it super enjoyable.

This season has been tough at the beginning particularly the lobbies(time to enter and matched against higher level opponents, pubs btw) but like other seasons, when a few weeks have gone by the lobbies become more manageable and get yours wins by not always sweating ours balls off. 

The truth behind this post is that people forget to have fun while playing and rather constantly complain on the media about something of the game. Im not saying its a bad thing but if you see the same complaint over and over, your not doing yourself any justice. People make it sound impossible to play the game because they are always matched in the so called pred lobbies but I find it untrue and its just a cover up for losing most of your games. Yes having good games does throw you in tougher lobbies but lets not forget everyone is getting better at the game.

In conclusion, stop being whining little bitches and play the game for fun. For sure some people will call this meat-riding respawn but those same people always look at the negatives and never anything positive. Seriously trying to be positive is a bad thing nowadays.

The FF event is fun and entertaining so  I don't understand why were making post asking for regular trios back. The only thing yall do in regular pubs is disregard your team, hotdrop, rush a 1v3, die, then leave. You still have duos to play or you can simply not play the game while the event is active. You can hang out with your kids, friends, family or do literally anything else with your time beside being on reddit and complaining. 

 Now onto the collection event. Yes it overpriced but here the thing there's no point in making posts talking about the cosmetic being expensive, simply do not buy it. Anyone one with half a brain would know this and getting mad at people that tell you not to buy is dumb plus there a lot of things in this world that some would think it's overpriced but there will always people that have no problem buying because it what they find joy in so calling them an ""idiot"" or  ""wales"" because they spent their money on something you wouldn't is ridiculous.

The issue isn’t lack of patience... it’s a lack of communication and content by Respawn,"I have never seen a game in my lifetime get this blind fanboy allegiance and forgiveness to a game company with a lack of communication and content updates. I, like others, only want the battle pass because it is something new and exciting. Hell, I’d take any new patch or update. 

My want for the battle pass is because it’s the only thing on the horizon.  The lack of communication and engagement by Respawn is honestly inexcusable. The Reddit fanboys here can scream patience all they want, but this game is dramatically dwindling on twitch as any other game company has far more frequent updates and communication. 

I get that they vaguely said March, but that doesn’t mean you don’t look like a douche if it turns out to be March 31. If I tell my girl “I’ll see ya tonight” and don’t show till 11:59pm....sure I didn’t lie.... but I misled her and kept her hopes up the entire night and now she’d be bitter and over hanging out. 

If Respawn honestly thinks it can compete against Fortnite or have hopes of being the #1 with the slowest cadence and rollout of any battle royale, they are in for a rude awakening. If Respawn wants to truly be #1, it takes more than just being #1 in gameplay. Open dialogue, communication, AMAs, PR, and constant updates need to also be #1 imo. 

Communication could be the bandaid to temper expectation instead of the community going through a constant cycle of speculation and let down. It would take just one 5min post by 1 employee to avoid this fiasco. That’s the biggest issue and the easiest to fix. Just communicate and keep an open dialogue! 

Game updates take time... but vital communication only takes a few minutes by 1 employee.

Prediction: Map Scans will RUIN Solo-Q.,"I'm kind of disappointed to hear that S16's recon class will have the ability to scan the beacon and show enemy players.

I play Solo-Q, since none of my friends play Apex Legends. I'd say a good 30% of my games in Diamond lobbies are destroyed by poor SBMM and just plain bad teammates who won't communicate or will rush into fragment and die immediately. Thus, being able to rat and secure placement is an invaluable skill if you are a Solo-Q. You don't have to gain RP this way, you just have to mitigate your losses. It's a whole lot better to go -6 than it is to go -45.

While scan characters like Seer and Bloodhound made this harder, it also made it more of a challenge to be able to rat successfully. I felt like this was a happy medium: No you can't just hide in a corner anymore, you have to be aware of enemy team composition (whether they have a scan legend) and position accordingly. You need strategy.

However, now, when it gets down to 8 or 9 teams left, people are just going to sit at a recon beacon and scan the map for solo players to hunt down.

I'm honestly worried about being able to hit Masters as a Solo-Q next Season because of this and I hope it gets nerfed or changed immediately.

I could be completely wrong. I'm also sure there's a bunch of you who think any form of ratting should be banned. Who knows. It just didn't make me happy to hear.",apexlegends,1676075091.0,t3_10z7fa9

Tips for keeping my K/D at 10?,,apexlegends,1628956939.0,t3_p4aotn
You got us GOOD EA/Respawn. This battle pass is a JOKE!,"""You can't possibly think you're just gonna paddle by with this battle pass stunt""  


First you reeled us in real nice with the free Apex packs til we realized they dropped off completely at 100. Kept your window nice and clear of being bombarded by content creators and streamers (except the ones you paid a million to keep their lips tight while playing) After that we were left staring at a screen that offered simple weapon camos and skins for 18$ USD which that alone is ridiculous but luckily there's a portion of idiots who will cover your ass with ""It's ONLY cosmetic, don't like it, don't buy it!""  


But you can't possibly think you're just gonna paddle by with this battle pass stunt.. This is actually a joke even by EA's standards. This battle pass starts off richly by offering 3 horrible looking skins seemingly designed by a hyper-active child with a paint brush. Then we get harvest, navigator and patchwork camo for all the weapons which we can all collectively agree are absolutely hot wet trash. You already know most of your players only use a few legends mainly so showing off my season 1 kills as Gibraltar is possibly one of the worst MTX I've ever seen in gaming.  


Let's just finish this off quickly. The quips are lame, the badges are garbage, the frames are a 5 minute photoshop job for even a beginner designer, a camper's bonus for hiding as long as possibly per match and the cherry on top is the fact that you had a clear cut blueprint for success with this battle pass. I don't care how much you hate Fortnite. Go take a gander at their battle pass and try to make the argument that Respawn and EA didn't collectively shit the bed on this one. It's not even a competition between the two.. Don't even get me started on the grind.. Even if you're performing and clutching wins in 3 peats it's grindy as hell.  


This battlepass somehow ended up being worse than Black Ops 4's bpass which is arguably the worst battle pass in battle royale. How did you guys manage this? Is it blatant stupidity or are you just testing the waters to see if we'll eat the garbage while you dine on Kobe steak and Imperial Brut champagne?

This is the reason I'm leaving Apex Legends,"Original post:  [https://answers.ea.com/t5/Informacoes-de-jogos/This-is-the-reason-I-m-leaving-Apex-Legends/m-p/9066260#M2031](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Informacoes-de-jogos/This-is-the-reason-I-m-leaving-Apex-Legends/m-p/9066260#M2031)

&#x200B;

To me, playing this game has been basically a never ending chore - it is not even fun anymore. So I have decided to list the reasons why I can't play it anymore with some possible solutions:

&#x200B;

1. Gameplay issues:
   1. It takes too long to use the Legendary knockdown shield - long enough for a massive war to end and people still finish you off before you revive. Compare this to warzone's revival time of self-revive kit and you will see how this is an issue.
   2. Melee in this game is broken, it's simply useless. A guy can jump on top of you and you still miss the hit easily. I think it should be somewhat reverted to the original design where the hit was guided to prevent this annoying misses.
   3. Shields have too much sustain compared to weapons' damage, so you can't kill people on open grounds that easily unless you hit them with every single bullet in your mag. Compare this to warzone's damage / shield sustain and you can see how this is ridiculous unless you are a cheater or a pro (maybe both? its pretty common these days...).
   4. Wingman should have a falloff damage, because people are using this weapon as a sniper to kill people from insane ranges - this is a pistol for god's sake!
   5. You can't cook granades - this is a basic necessity in FPS games! - By the way, where are the mines!??!?!
   6. Can't swap a broken evo-shield for a white one on corpse unless you hold the button. I literally died once because of this delay...
   7. Thermite is bugged - Once I died by a thermite that hit me through the walls and there was no signs of it burning there...
2. Lack of incentives to play:
   1. The amount of customizable things is very limited and expensive:
      1. Too little weapons to choose from (no grenade launcher yet?). The customization is poor compared to Warzone - where you can change the weapon loadout, put stickers, change skin, etc. Also, a single skin in the shop costs twice as much as the battle pass - this is insane.
      2. The legend's skins don't change the legends abilities' effects as is the case in any MOBA game. For instance - caustic's Santa skin could've changed the traps to be a present, or whatever.
      3. I think it would be awesome to be able to customize the legend's abilities with power-ups, for instance, something to increase range of caustic traps, but making it slower to act, etc.
   2. The rewards in this game are not interesting:
      1. It takes a long time to get loot boxes and when you get them, their contents aren't exciting.
      2. The events' loots are also not worth the trouble.
   3. Respawn should not use events as an excuse to test gameplay - just make an update and test it, it's no like we want a party for us to play regular stuff (I'm talking about the solo matches for instance)
   4. Too much effort to get battle pass level 110 - This game punishes people that play for long times occasionally instead of playing regularly every week. This is annoying because not only most people don't have time to play every single week for days to grind level, but also because people aren't slaves to Apex - We have other things to do / play. I think it would be nice to have double xp on weekends or on the season's last weeks, or maybe give absent people bonus xp to make them come back and play.
   5. Legend tokens are a useless joke and the crafting materials are very rare - some might not use them as much as they might like (I have used it in a legendary skin once since last year). Maybe it would be better to allow us to change the weekly challenges with the legend tokens and increase crafting materials drop.
   6. I feel Rrespawn does not listen to the community to give the users a better game experience while playing.
3. Quality of live issues:
   1. The lobby screen takes too long to start the match and if someone picks your main legend, you are assigned a random one. This can be avoided by making people define a preset of three legends so the loading screen skips your pick faster and chose a legend you might like to play with. Make it optional if this is such a problem!!!
   2. I'm still getting connection problems to this day, even with a reasonable internet speed. Always getting prediction error / micro-lags. Maybe there could be something to test the server-client connection and output logs for the user to see what we could do to improve this. Also, please allow us to change servers in-game - not while starting the game.
   3. Too many cheaters in this game - I can tell that at least 20% of people I play against are either using wallhacks or no-recoil, with just a small amount of people using aimbot.
   4. Origin is one of the worst gaming platforms to play with - always getting problems opening this up to start apex. Please let me play without opening origin first, or move to Steam (lol).

Until this game starts to be fun again I'll be playing cod warzone...

UPDATE (season 5):

1 - golden k.o. shield still stucks;

2 - forgot to add there should be an option to loot friends items without first picking their tag, this would save people in fights which is always a good option;

3 - evo shild should fill the shield you get when you upgrade when you fight - or at least every 2 levels, I dont know...",apexlegends,1588882885.0,t3_gfed81

"They can rework the entire game, but until they add the new matchmaking system it's not going to be fun to play","I just ended a game session (playing solo) and I lost 15 games in a row.

Some of them at drop where you can die by different circumstances or RNG, most of them because of the current matchmaking that expects you to carry low level players and play against high level players (sometimes way to high level).

Not blaming my teammates at all, I even feel bad for some of them for having me as a teammate, I'm good at shooters but I'm not even close to being at the same skill level as a predator or master, and because of me they get paired against 3 stack predators.

I really hope this new matchmaking system gets implemented soon, Season 16 had a lot of cool changes but I can't even enjoy the game",apexlegends,1677011736.0,t3_118ebk7
I'm done with the season and this map.,"This season is horrible for solo players. I've been grinding to diamond III for past 7 seasons. I don't have time to play 6 hours a day. Just got demoted back to silver. There can be no team play because 4/5 times you queue with a duo who hot drops and doesn't give a shit about you and so all your games are either take huge loss in points or try to rat to top 3 alone. Another option is to spectate said duo. They won't ress you because of the attention it brings. It's impossible to progress without making it to top 5 and even then your reward is +100pts. /rant

We desperately need new content. The game is beginning to feel stale.,"  

With updates coming so rarely, we need a BIG update. Only getting 1 new legend, a new special weapon with a few map changes won’t cut it. I have played this game almost every day since launch, but not sure how much longer I will play without some substantial changes and I do spend money on the game. If this is to be a live service game, we need content updates and especially fixed to bugs (audio! This is the only game where I am constantly second guessing if I heard footsteps or just some random noise). Here are some thing I think the game desperately needs with the next update to keep players coming back:

New weapons (not crap like the L-Star, but common weapons)

New usable items

New usable in game things like the jump balloons

2 new legends (yes, 2. We have only had 2 new legends released so far in what, 7-8 months? )

A substantial overhaul of the map with new areas (There is so much unused potential such as the insides of mountains. Just carve out a big mountain and make it a maze or something with elevation.)

Solo and Duo modes

This might seem like a lot, but we haven’t really had many updates since launch. Especially relating to bug fixes. I love this game, but it needs updating.

Edit:
For people saying to take a break, I get that.  However, I don't really play single player games.  Only multiplayer and with my friends.  It's hard to find a game we all enjoy so we typically stick to one for a long time.  Also, it's not like I'm sitting on my ass for 8 hours a day playing this.  I play about 1-2 hours a day if my friends are on.  That being said, I have a feeling Respawn is looking to make people like me and my friends happy who play over a long period of time and spend money on the game. For people like that, we need new content.  Anyways, maybe we will go back to Blackout for a while and see how much that has changed.",apexlegends,1567014468.0,t3_cwo7ji

The nostalgia for Kings Canyon is becoming stale,"To the devs: please keep doing what you are doing, I love everything about what you have done with apex since the beginning.

I recognize we are going back to Kings Canyon at some point in S4, and i hope you have changed it so that it resembles WE more than the old KC.   


To the nostalgic players who constantly post about how much they miss kings canyon: You miss the mystique of apex when it was new, and the wide horizons of possibilities it represented. Now that those possibilities have been fleshed out, some of that mysticism is gone. What you are nostalgic for is not something that can ever be attained again by this game; lightning cannot be bottled. Please recognize the dangers of this nostalgic voice becoming so prevalent on this sub, that it results in actual change in the game due to romanticizing a past that never existed. Please be more open to moving onto new and better things. Also, learn to shoot. Jesus i swear the only people who dont like WE are the ones who wanna spank with an R99 and a pk every game. Pick up the g7 if you are learning to shoot at distance, its absolutely ridiculous for allfathers sake.

"Pride Month Post: Bloodhound is Non-Binary. Not a man, not a woman. Stop using the wrong pronouns for them.","I wouldve posted about this at the beginning or end of Pride Month but I've seen a lot of discussions that include *them* for some reason lately (Are *they* being mained more or something? Are people figuring out *they're* actually really good in Arenas?). At least 80% of which involves users misgendering *them,* and by extension, erasing the sizable number of NB or otherwise trans Apex players and acting as if they don't exist.

We've known *they* use They/Them pronouns since like the BEGINNING of the fucking creation of Apex Legends. Respawn is proud to include *their* gender identity in the game and has made it clear *they* are non-binary. On top of that, *they* both LOOK androgynous (you cant even see *their* face), and sound androgynous. There is no reason to misgender *them.* If you can call a fuckin robot (love you, Pathy) by masc pronouns, you can use the designated pronouns of an actual human character.

And this goes beyond just a battle royale video game. If someone states their pronouns/gender identity clearly, FUCKING RESPECT THAT. The least you can do is start with a damn fictional character, thats the bare minimum.

Time is running out for Apex. Game can still be saved from mediocrity.,"The hype is over. Apex is in a tough place but there is still time to stop the negative tide.

Viewers are dropping fast and streamers are leaving.

In modern on-line gaming if you are not successful in Twitch people translate that as ""dead"" and that's not far from truth.

The next month will be critical. Without immediate changes, Apex will become the new ""\*Game that was popular for a month"" and it will long be forgotten. You can't really recover from the ""grave"". There will be a stable base of players that will continue play occasionally but nothing spectacular. Updates will come every 2-3 months. Another game in the large pool.

Many of us will return to Fortnite/Pubg till the next battle royale.

&#x200B;

Apex must give signs that can still make it. There is a large list of possible changes here in reddit that should happen fast. (I will just write the most common). Don't fix all at once and not exactly this way but you should start from somewhere.

&#x200B;

* Introduce Solo/Duos (Squad of 3 was nice, I know the game was made based on that. Apex has incredible ping system but you can't have just one game mode in 2019. People get bored easily.
* Progression after lvl 100. (Follow Overwatch system, you give the players an objective and something to look forward. People like to ""flex"" a lot and that is normal. Give them something to play.)
* Fix ""Apex tokens"" (Something is incomplete with this system. It seems absurd to have 50k Apex tokens and nothing to do with them.)
* Introduce events/challenges. This is modern gaming things are tough. People need something to actively engage cause they have a lot of options to play something else.

&#x200B;

There are many more suggestions but there is no need to write them all. Bottom line is make a plan and stick with it. Communicate and say something ""Hey guys this is our Roadmap. X will come at the end of April hang in there"".

The general feeling now is that nothing is gonna really change till Season 2 and this is a long and far away. Player-base will shrink more till then.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading.

Also you can continue to pretend that everything is perfect but lets see how you will feel when the numbers will drop. Don't be romantic. If a product fails companies just cut resources.

"This game is FREE, you do not have to spend a penny on a single thing. Take the circlejerks about the store / lootboxes elsewhere.","PREFACE (TLDR):

You're being critical of their monetization system before you've seen the entire system at play, we've yet to see or experience battle passes.

This is similar to a person telling Da Vinci that his painting looks bad when all you can see is Mona Lisa's nose.

You need to wait to see the full picture, then pass judgement. Its unfair to call anything predatory in the grand scheme of things if we've yet to see how much content is in the battle pass and how accessible it makes loot to its players.
___________________________


The amount of villainizing in this Sub is astonishing. 

Apex legends is a free game, there are multiple ways to obtain loot in this game and one of which hasn't even been released yet **due to the first Season Starting in March.**

- You can get boxes on leveling up.

- You can get crafting materials in the boxes, free and paid.

- You can outright buy purchasable items on the Store page for Apex coins.

- You will be able to buy a season pass that will LIKELY include a bunch of obtainable loot for $10-20 for roughly 2-3months at a time.

On top of all of this, The lootboxes outright say to you the % chance of finding tiered loot & **There is no duplicates**.

So yes, of course as you level the boxes start to slow down, because if they didn't everyone would have every item in the game after 80 levels.

The more ""duplicates"" you would get the more crafting materials you get, and the more materials you get the more skins you can outright aim to get.

Why are we making Respawn look like shit-faced assholes for putting in lootboxes into a free game? 

_______________________________

Side question, in the whole ""loot box"" thing, why is it always the sellers fault for selling something rather than the Buyers fault for not having any impulse control?

There are many stages your brain goes through before a purchase and at any point in time, you can say ""nope"" and just not buy something.

People keep bringing up kids like they wouldn't spend their parents money or outright steal from them if lootboxes didn't exist.

Back in the day, we would snag our mom/dads credit card to purchase anything from a video game. It never needed to be loot box, we just wanted cool loot.

Players who go into the process of buying a loot box understand that there are hundereds of items in the game and they're going into it knowing that they aren't targeting any particular item as their end goal via the purchase.

Its time to stop blaming the Devs / publishers for monetizing their game, and time to start blaming the fools who spend endlessly on any items that they outright can't afford to do so.

_______________________________

#To the people who think anything in this game is ""predatory"" other than bloodhound you are honestly a cancer to video games online and are the same exact type of person who would have prematurely shut this game down if Respawn had marketed it prior to its release.

Duos should be the standard Apex mode. Trios should be the limited time one.,"Duos's going down sadly and I'll probably be back on not playing the game again when without a friend backing me up, which is... most of the time.

Duos have been a refreshing take on the gameplay, allowing solo people to still have a better chance of getting a decent mate, or the chance to come out of those 1v2 when they didn't get one. People with one buddy had a chance of teaming up nicely without the random variable.

Duos pace is nice, loot is better, 3rd party is less a certain death sentence, and all in all the game is still Apex at the core as an abilities driven team based game.

Duos should be the standard Apex. Trios should be the LTM one. Even better if we could have BOTH.

A) they have been working on all the bug fixes and qol issues along side the pass. 

B) you can earn a BP for season two just by playing (which you’re going to anyway)

C) it’s a free game. $10 is less than some of you spend on DLCs for paid games!

Aim assist is not broken,Aim assist is not broken it is perfectly fine and balanced. The reason why controller players have aim assist is because we don't have all the advantages that PC gets. On a controller analog stick we have a mid point that has to crossed everything time we move or change direction so the input changes only when we cross the mid point. While a PC mouse is just a sensor able you change direction in an instant. Also PC players use their entire arm for movement and aim while while we use our thumbs. The only reason why PC players complain about aim assist is because of ego. PC players can't contemplate getting destroyed by controller players so they blame aim assist when really it is a matter of skill. If you die to a controller player and you are on mouse and keyboard it's on you. The controller player is a just better than you. Aim assist is not even in the equation. Mouse and keyboard has a lot more advanced than controller with better movement and gun play.,apexlegends,1642195907.0,t3_s43794
"Sorry LuLu, streamers DO have more access to Hideout than the rest of us.","Regardless of whether these players killing streamers are verified cheating or not (in some cases, streamers really do jump the gun and report legitimate players), today's bamboozle was not the only reason why the community is a little upset with this whole ""Hideout"" setup that respawn has. Despite what LuLu and Wigg want to claim, the fact remains that high level streamers have access to Respawn's banning agent that normal players do not have. In the YT link below, NiceWigg runs into a cheater, and within 2 minutes, their team hears back from Hideout that the player was cheating. There are people out there, including myself, that have reported players and have never heard back only to run into the same cheaters later on. In the twitch link below, Wigg is literally playing with Hideout. I'm not suggesting that it is bad for a Respawn dev to mingle with the figures in their game community, but the unlimited access to the ""ban guy"" that streamers have creates the possibility for the ""my dad's a dev and I'm going to get him to ban you"" attitude that might not always be accurate. It also makes normal players feel like that, if they are not streaming, their experience in the game does not matter to the devs as much streamers. Sure, maybe today was a mistake, but the fact that it was a mistake shouldn't mask the need for a little bit of change.

Apex is dying. And if Respawn doesn't change their bad habits then this game is doomed to be their 3rd failure in a row.,"***Epic Games have nothing to fear about Apex taking the throne away from Fortnite. Respawn will kill Apex far before it even has a chance to show its full power.***

&#x200B;

**Absolutely no communication whatsoever.** From what we've seen in the past with TF1 and TF2 and what we've been seeing now with Apex, the best assumption we can make is to assume that you are doing nothing with this game and will continue to do nothing.

**No solos, duos, and 4 player squads.** These are things that people want very badly and will become the reasons why they inevitably switch to other games if you continue to not add them.

*And for the people that are already typing their comments about Apex being ""Team oriented"" or how you wouldn't be able to use the ping system or be able to revive in solo:*

*1. Apex is not a ""Team oriented"" game. The ping system and reviving are just additions on top of the base game to make team modes work. A solo mode without these things in it would work 100% perfectly fine as they aren't necessary when you're BY YOURSELF.*

*2. When it comes down to it, no one gives a flying fuck. If Respawn doesn't cater to these people's needs then they will take their business elsewhere. And that is exactly what's happening.*

**Bugs/Problems that have been here since day 1.** Minor annoyances will get more and more annoying and will become deal breakers if they continue to be unfixed. E.g. Sound bug on consoles and cheating on PC.

**Lack of updates.** The lack of updates is just further evidence that you have no intentions on doing anything with your game.

**Shitty battle pass.** Some people need that dopamine to keep playing, you are failing to provide that.

Oh, boo-hoo. ""Ranked is where I play against similarly skilled opponents, casual is supposed to be for fun""... Fun for who? The average players who are getting stomped into mud by pre-mades with 60,000 kills between them? 
 
*High Ranked and Professional Players Shouldn't Be The Target Audience, and Shouldn't Be Catered To*. It's fucking absurd that you sweaty-assed super-preds think you should be able to go into matches and just destroy everyone.
 
 ""Oh but SBMM would make the game hard for me to enjoy because I can't pub-stomp"". Cry me a damned river and go for a swim. Murdering players with 1/10 the experience and skills you have make the game hard for them, and there's a lot fucking more of them. These are the people who could, later, make you better by offering a challenge. Instead, they just hate the gaming experience they just had. 
 
Players who have bad experiences stop playing. Stop playing = stop paying. Stop paying = decline in the IRL value of the game. Value down = EA big mad = More overpriced events to make up for it. So, by crying that you want to bully less skilled players you're effectively making the game worse for everyone because you're a little pussy who just wants easy fights to pad your stats. 
 
For every master/pred/pro who's ever bitched about MatchMaking because they had to try a little harder, eat a dick. I'm over here getting matched on teams with 1 other teammate who's level 18, and I'm in your pubs match trying to just survive without them quitting. If you're out here mad that you can't always bully smaller players while I'm out here trying to carry this noob so they don't quit and finish screwing my match, your struggle is irrelevant and you suck maggot-infested corpse asshole.

This game has a ton of content we don't need a new shiny thing every week. Stop the whining threads.,"A lot of people complaining on here that there isn't enough content. I for one enjoy playing the game, I don't need a new gun every week. There's always something new to learn every single day playing this game.

You learn to peak fire, bunny hop backwards, new ways to rotate, using scroll wheel single fire the hemlock to reduce recoil and increase fire rate, and on and on.


This is all content, pre built into the game but a lot of people don't see it because all they're looking for is a shiny new thing.

I've maxed out the battle pass and I didn't need some xp event or whatever to do it. I just enjoyed playing the game, and did so consistently an hour a day sometimes more sometimes less. 

That being said, I believe season lengths are a tad long perhaps reduce the length of it ever so slightly. Overwatch started out with really long seasons too but they also got shorter over time. I believe apex will follow suit, it just makes sense because you'll please the majority of people this way.

I would much rather they work on big fixes and server issues than release a new badge each week for people with short attention spans. The servers are waaaaay better than day one.

i am a fanboy of blizzard so i am used to waiting up to 3 years for a new game and for quallity updates wee wait around a couple of months for the games i play.

 i support every decision u'll make but u can't keep the player base on the ""soon"" train, if u announced in the roadmap it will be coming out n march and for some reason it won't be out in march u need to update us u need to communicate your problems to us, the players, the payers, the ""wallets"".

 u can't keep us in the dark, i see alot of toxicity in the forums, reddit, twitter and in the apex discord servers, people expected the battle pass to drop 3 days ago but they got annoyed when it didn't.
 u saying nothing and keeping us in the dark, doesn’t help.

people want to know, please update us on the battle pass disscussion, if u want this game to succeed  u need to have an healthy relationship with the player base.
like any relationship it starts with communication.

 PUBG died cuz of poor communication between the player base and the devs, no one wants to see your work and the amazing game ""apex legends"" go down.

 please communicate with us and atleast tell us an exact date of the battle pass release or atleast an avg or estimated time that isn't ""soon"".

Depending on the drop ship route ofc.

Do I get games where most people are gone by round 1? Yes. Do I get games where I don’t land fragment and by luck end up playing walking simulator until final 5? Yes.  But that’s the nature of playing BR, it happens.

1- solos and duos
2- increase amount of players on drop. It’s too dull in the middle sections of the game far too often and I push almost every shot that I hear.
3- fix the bugs. I get dropped from a game on Xbox at least once every time I log on
4- add more legends

6- add new guns and equipment
7- fix the store. I want to spend money on this game but nothing is worth it. Not even the battle pass that I purchased
8- fix cosmetics. This means a lot less to me than it does to others. They generally aren’t very cool tho

"Wattson's ""Buff"" is ACTUALLY a Nerf! (Change Breakdown)","**TL;DR at the End!**

I have to say i'm really disappointed at how the Devs treated Wattson, almost every aspect of the so called ""Buff"" to Wattson is actually a **Nerf**, a **negligible Buff** or a **Quality of Life** Change..

To kick things off this Opinion-thread, it is coming from the mouth of a let down Wattson main that mains her since season 3 and is holding Heirloom shards since season 5:

[True Wattson](https://preview.redd.it/62xvkjy77ez71.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa3219a73ca8e652d44e0934c2abde90cc439815)

Lets begin from the obvious bits..

* **Wattson has had her Hitbox get bigger by almost 30%**, more ways to look at it are that Wattson is now 30% easier to hit/Wattson now takes 30% more damage. I have to say this step is really unnecessary since from my experience there are countless times where i get easily one-clipped by players with good aim and since people with bad aim still dont kill me, but they contribute more towards me being dead(they deal 150 damage instead of 120 for instance). This makes skilled plays be less likely, and makes Wattson more frustrating to play when u can just get swatted so easily. Now, considering how unlike wraith who had a similar nerf to her hitbox, Wattson has no dis-engagement ability, you realize that Wattson players are sentenced for death when out of cover (especially in the new map where there is considerably less cover and more open scenes). This is an obvious issue since its unanimously worsening Wattson's survivability with nothing to compensate for it as you are about to see in the rest of this breakdown..
* **""Increased debuff duration on crossing a Fence by 100%. (1.5 to 3 seconds)""**, this is the only part of the ""Buff"" that i consider an actual buff, even though 1.5 seconds were plenty time to kill someone who pushed a fence of yours, even though small, its still a Buff.
* **""Decreased recharge time by 50% (30 to 15 seconds)""**. This is a Buff, a Moderate one. thats because its not fast enough to be able to set a camp in a house you're holding - you still need your Gen. With that being said it helps getting the upper hand when moving around with Wattson since you now can place fences twice as often.
* **""Increased placement range by 50%""**. Not much to say.. its a very negligible Buff.
* ""**Wattson now moves at Unarmed-speed while readying/placing Fence nodes"" +  ""Fence nodes can now be placed as soon as the weapon is readied, instead of waiting for the animation to finish"".** These are just quality of life, making fences is just more intuitive now.

So up until now it seems like there's a fair bit of Buffs, and you'd be right, but that's where the Buffs end, really.. Now lets move on to the bits of the ""Buff"" that are less obvious which way they go:

* **""Increased damage on crossing a Fence by 33%. (15 to 20)""**. On first Sight it looks like an actual Buff, but when combined with the next Change it is apparent that its actually a Moderate Nerf for a few reasons that ill mention in the next bullet..
* **""Increased the time allowance to be hit again by a subsequent Fence effect by 100%. (0.5 to 1 second)""**. Since now you get hit half as often, the damage fences deal per second is 20, rather then 30 (1x20dmg rather then 2x15dmg). In addition, since you get hit less often, the fence has less chances to kill you if you are low on hp since it ticks damage less often now.
* **""Decreased the delay between Fences shutting off and reactivating after an ally passes through them by 60%. (1.0 -> 0.4 seconds)""**. This could be useful, but rarely. What it affects most is the ability to go through a door that u fenced off without breaking it (managing to close the door behind you.), this is a big Nerf since you cannot utilize door blocking + the camp you're holding now has been breached and they can start shooting your pylon, you and your fences.
* **""Pylon ordnance-zapping has been moderately reworked.""** Still broken, there's still ways of sticking nades inside of a pylons range.
* **""Improved the reliability and responsiveness of placing Wattson's Tactical and Ultimate in-world objects""**. Right now this is broken, fences make the sound that they are stretched when they are not, fences are invisible to you sometimes, placing fences is harder and more awkward. Wattson mains cannot even feel safe anymore when they think they are fenced off or getting pushed since its so awkward to put fences now. For instance in one of my games i blocked a zip with a fence, or so i thought - it made the stretched fence electrifying sound, but didnt actually set up a fence on it, got pushed from where i thought there was a fence after i turned around to address one of the attackers and died.. This happened **Multiple** times with various people i know too - plain awful..

Other parts i did not mention since they are really negligible. The take from this is that Wattson was largely Nerfed when it comes to skill plays that you could pull of since shes alot less reliable now, making it quite ironicaly, achieve the opposite of what Respawn intended with the changes. Respawn stated that their intentions are as follows:

>*""We want to enable more active gameplay from Wattson players by* ***smoothing out the rough edges in placing fences. Responsiveness tweaks,***  *longer range, and faster cooldowns means that Wattson can much* ***more quickly and reliably set up a defensive position, or even use her fences and pylon in the midst of open combat in a pinch***\*.\*""

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

The poor execution of the changes combined together with the straight up Nerfs that don't allow you to use her as skillfully, and the insane Hitbox Nerf caused her to lose alot of what made players who are good with her liked and made it so they have a much harder time with pulling off plays, while making others have an easier time killing a you... It is the combinations of both making her less useful, failing to make her more reliable, and straight up Nerfing her survivability in gunfights through the hitbox changes that atleast for me, make her close to unplayable anymore, or at best makes her **considerably** less enjoyable.

I strongly believe that the reliability changes need to get fleshed out, her pylon to get truly fixed, her hitbox Nerf to be toned down in numbers (10-15% Would be enough so shes not dead meat while running out of cover) and the functionality of the fences restored to what it was in order for it to be a successful re-balance that would lean towards the Quality of Life, making Wattson more intuitive, fun and useful.Though as it currently stands though, its largely a Nerf to Wattson and it makes playing her not enjoyable.

Side note, i find it funny how they call this a Wattson season, and on top of all the problems in the ""Buff"" they release the worst map for Wattson so far which amplifies the problems with these changes..

I would love to hear what others have been experiencing and have to say.

Opinion on why the Charge Rifle should be removed from the game not just nerfed,"Hey everyone, just wanted to give an opinion on why I think the Charge Rifle (CR) should be removed entirely from the game and not just nerfed. Not trying to complain here I just wanted to give a honest opinion on why the charge rifle unbalances the sniping meta of the game. 

\- Slows down enemies with the laser beam. just about freezes the target for seconds allowing the ability to easily hit your target and easily allows other members on the opposing squad to tag you as well. If a squad has two charge rifles you can absolutely get knocked before having the ability to go for cover. 

\- The charge rifle, has basically made the Longbow and Triple Take obsolete. Both weapons require far more skill to hit opponents especially at longer distances. The Longbow requires knowledge of the bullet drop and needs to be practiced with in order to hit and lead those long range shots. The Triple Take ( with choke ) requires the sniper to allow the sight to close in for each shot to hit maximum damage. The Triple does/can do more damage than the CR, but there is a few seconds before the shooter can bring in the choke to hit maximum damage, which adds a nice balancing to the weapon. 

\- The fact that the CR has no drop off whatsoever allowing you to third party from across the map or pin down entire squads with a single charge rifle. 

\- The amount of damage the CR can do considering it requires very little skill to use

\- The spawn rate of the gun, it can be found as much as any other weapon if not more. 

\- The fact that when you fire it at an enemy it is difficult for that enemy to see the person that is shooting at him. Yes, there is a ginormous laser that tells you but it can temporarily blind the target that can make it difficult to return fire at times. 

\- The speed of its fire rate

\- The fact that it can be used close range as a hip fire weapon. we know the triple can be like a shotgun at close range sometimes, but the Longbow can be very difficult to hip fire. 

I did not include the G7 just because it doesn't really compare long range, though it is a great gun. I just wanted to bring an opinion to light because I really enjoy this season and the new map, but throughout my many games I have rarely seen anyone with the Triple Takes or Longbow except for the start of the game. I just feel the CR has diminished the diversity of sniper rifles that people are using and making sniping something anyone can do not just someone who has practiced and spent time developing their skill on bullet drops and leading opponents . 

Hopefully this did not come off the wrong way, I do know that a nerf is coming from the developers in this next update, but I strongly feel that even after the nerf the meta will not change and it will still be overpowered and unbalanced.",apexlegends,1571029817.0,t3_dhlxtv

Please stop running from 2v3s,"If you’re solo queueing, and one of your teammates gets downed, PLEASE do not just run away. The number of times I trade, and then take another one down before I get traded (leaving it 1v1), and I look at the map, and the 3rd is half way across the map is mind boggling. If you can’t win a 1v1, or at least chall a 2v3, please don’t play Ranked. It’s not fun for your teammates and it can’t be fun for you.

EDIT: For people asking about circumstances or comms, here is my response to you.
1. If both teammates get downed while 3 opponents are up, then it is absolutely the right thing to run away.
2. If your shields/health are low, it is absolutely the right thing to get cover and heal, but still be nearby if needed. Run away ONLY if it becomes 1v3 while healing.
3. There is a kill feed. It tells you how many opponents might be up, how many got cracked, etc.
4. Grinding for LP does not equal actual skill rank. So *saving* 50-75 LP, in my personal *opinion*, doesn’t mean anything if you’re ranking up but can’t take 2v3s. “Grinding” to Masters doesn’t make you a Masters player.
5. Not even talking about one player apeing, it could just be a 3v3 and someone got beamed, or someone just got ambushed while looting and couldn’t get away. I agree with not risking for careless teammates, but that’s not what I’m talking about here.
6. As someone else commented below, crafting/respawning should be last resort, not first. Chances of finding a safe crafter is less than half, finding safe beacon is probably like 10%. Just say you’d rather run around until half the lobby is dead to save a pathetic amount of LP.",apexlegends,1693904298.0,t3_16aixmn

Bonding time - recognizes either an ally or enemy champion as his child at the start of the game, gives a passive bonding bonus the longer you are close together.

Tactical -Yells out dad joke without 10 meters, any enemies or allies caught in range will be forced to facepalm and be unable to shoot for x seconds

But yet, the biggest problem still remains. The one thing that, along with a whole host of other problems, really makes Horizon's tactical the nost powerful movement ability in this game. It can move the whole team at once.

Think about it. Pathfinder can't grapple his whole team; he needs his ult to move them. Wraith can't phase her whole team, she needs her ult to move them. Octane can't stim his whole team, he needs his ult to move them. Valkyrie can't... yada yada you get the idea.

But Horizon has absolutely no problem moving her team whenever she needs to. And I think that the ability to do so, as well as many other functions of her lift, are what really make it kinda busted.

"Apex legends will die without a solo mode, change my mind","Don’t get me wrong, I’m loving the game. But forcing a player to play with randoms if friends aren’t online will severely deter me from playing.
I want to play by myself and get better without having horrible team mates and get absolutely destroyed by a communicating squad of 3. 
The only arguement I see Respawn and other people make against solo is that Respawn developed the ability set and the game for squads so it wouldn’t play well in solo. I don’t think this is the case, it will play differently but metas will evolve and it will be fun.

From a week 0 player: this is the worst state Apex has ever been in. Let's talk about it.,"Playing since week 0 of the game and this is worst season by a landslide. 

* Shittiest ranked ever. People are just content with crouching and playing mobile games on their phone INSTEAD of actually playing the game.
* Apex is great because the gunplay and movement are great. Currently ranked disincentivizes both
* Controller vs MKB imbalances are warping the gameplay too much. DPS from Roller players is too high and TTK getting too low. Apex always was fun because of counterplay, but with optimized R99 tracking by roller there is no competing
* Seer and Nemesis adjustments are showing that Respawn has no clue about balance 
* The map rotation is just terrible. For unranked atleast they could rotate in maps that play good in unranked like Olympus/KC. For ranked camping snoozefests the big maps are fine, but not in unranked
* Again: people love this game because of MOVEMENT and GUNPLAY. Stop forcing the playerbase into maps that disincentivize this.
* No duo ranked still while we get shitty other modes that nobody cares about. Duo ranked is the most requested feature by a mile. 

Apex is trending down fast and it's 100% because Respawn does not give the players what they actually want but instead tries to force us into their meta/playstyle i.e. what they think is best for us instead of listening to player feedback.",apexlegends,1688298522.0,t3_14omdl4
I think the Mozambique might be the best gun in the game this season.,"Up close it has unparalleled damage and accuracy, and even at range it might not keep up on DPS but it stays accurate enough to find those finishing shots or interrupt a rez or whatever.

You obviously get the requirements of low ammo usage, low reliance on attachments, etc.

If you're a character that doesn't mind fighting up close, I think it's maybe actually the best gun in the game. Thoughts?",apexlegends,1677027999.0,t3_118krbd

I Think I'm Finally Done With Apex.,"Let me start by saying Apex is an incredible game. It's a fast paced take on the battle royale genre with all the mechanical polish you'd expect from a Respawn game and has been my personal goty for 2019. Unfortunately, the monetization has always been a black spot on the game. You see all the usual tricks, gambling for skins, limited rotating shop to take advantage of the fear of missing out, in game premium currency to obfuscate the dollar value of items, and a battlepass to keep engagement up throughout the season by tying a high value package to an extremely long grind (this one's actually pretty good for the non whales, but it's ultimately designed to feed into the more predatory monetization tactics) 

However, in addition to the stuff I was prepared to deal with in a free game, the actual shop prices are completely ridiculous. You have to pay $20 minimum for any skin in the shop, and they often have ""sales"" now which mean absolutely nothing since they don't put the price down to 1000 coins or below, meaning you still have to spend a minimum of $20 for a single skin, whether it be through directly purchasing $20 of coins, or using the $10 battlepass coins and paying an additional $10. There isn't a single skin in the game that I would say is worth $20, the game has a much more subdued artstyle than something cartoony like fortnite which can get pretty outlandish with the skins, so even the legendary skins just look kinda cool, but completely underwhelming considering the very high price. This isn't even taking into account that the weapon skins cost exactly the same price, $20, for an even more underwhelming cosmetic.

Now, with the introduction of the latest event, it's clear that they intend to make things even more predatory rather than taking any steps in the right direction. Instead of an option to just buy an overpriced skin, they've completely restricted it to gambling for the items you want. The prices, $7 a spin on the slot machine, are completely outrageous and it would cost over $150 to get everything from the event. In legendary hunt you were at least guaranteed a few cool skins through challenges, but now you're only guaranteed a couple of lootboxes, a meager consolation prize for those who aren't in the position to funnel ridiculous amounts of cash into gambling for cosmetics, probably not even enough crowns to buy anything decent off the new shop either. The 2 free packs, like the battlepass, are there to entice people into spending more money of course. The limited time event all ties back into exploiting people's fear of missing out, a highly effective and well proven tool in preying upon your playerbase. 

I've lost a lot of the respect I used to have for Respawn lately. I definitely get that this is probably pressure from EA, but if this is the product they're putting out, rapidly ramping up the predatory monetization while the servers are suffering from major stability issues and hacking is rampant, then I'm getting out while my memories of the game are still mostly positive. I see the reasoning behind all of this, hunting whales is more profitable than providing accessible monetization for the general playerbase, but it's clear that there are zero intentions to take things in a more positive, but still profitable direction. 

As long as whales exist, it's only going to get worse, and while I do hope that spending the goodwill of the playerbase to maximize profits eventually comes back to bite them, at the end of the day EA and Respawn are going to prioritize optimal profits over the players and probably make a shitload of money. I certainly can't do anything to stop it, and as long as the base game is fun, there probably won't be any real chance of collective efforts taking off. All I can really do is bail out and refuse to participate for whatever that's worth, probably not much.",apexlegends,1565725530.0,t3_cpyake

"Dear Respawn, PLEASE lower the Battle Pass amount of XP between levels","I've been loving Apex Legends since it launched back and Feburary and that's likely because I've felt so free and unrestricted by a lack battle pass and the innovation by Resapwn. However, when I heard the Battle Pass was coming, I was excited regardless, hoping for of innovation and improvement in the system, something Respawn has done before.

However, that didn't happen. Instead we've gotten probably one of the most tedious Battle Passes in any Battle Royale game or hell, even any game. Each level requires 29500 xp per level. This is close to double how much xp you need for higher account levels. This is incredibly absurd and honestly worrying. The said thing is that, it's a simple fix. Just reduced the XP needed by half and you'd have a more reasonable requirement that can be met by casuals and dedicated players alike.

The thing is, I'm okay with the lackluster rewards as long as I'm not chained to the game to get them. I don't want to sell my soul to the game to finish the Battle Pass. I understand this is the first battle pass, but there were others before it that were and are still arguably better. People want to keep likening the pass to Fortnite. Fortnite has daily challenges, weekly challenges, and regular level ups that help make the Battle Pass grind not a problem. Our pass has none of that and we get far less than what they do.

The reason we need to talk about this and get something done is be cause the longer we wait, the more likely nothing will be done. It's okay to criticize the pass. It's okay to criticize the game. As a consumer, you should demand better to get the most out of your products and services. I love Apex, but I can't agree with the Battle Pass at this moment in time because it sets a bad picture of Respawn and the game. People will report this stuff on gaming news outlets and on YouTube. Look at how Blackout got blew out of the water because of their abysmal Battle Pass grind. I don't want the the same for Apex.
So Dear Respawn, please, please lower the XP requirement per level. Please don't make the Battle Pass a nightmare to level up or else I don't know if I'll be able to stick around by the time the Season is over.


tl;dr, Respawn please adjust xp levels for the Battle Pass. It's not good for the game when other systems do it far better. This grindy battle pass will generate negative publicity for the game. And the community shouldn't be afraid to criticize the game

EDIT: Calling for half XP reduction was too much but I still wish the XP requirement to level up to be reduced to somewhere between 20000 and 25000

This Ranked split incentivizes ratting/looting simulator and you're lying to yourself if you think it doesn't.,"There are a lot of people saying out there that this split is higher skill and positioning because of the placement changes and it's wrong. Don't you remember all the screen shots last split s12 of people getting diamond without any kills or damage? That's because it's EASY to hide/rat to get top 10 or even top 3 placement. (Do note that I understand that doing this in the current split is near impossible with the RP changes) I was just pointing out how easy it is to hide.

All this does is incentivize dropping edge of the circle/map and avoiding any sort of pvp until top 10. Why would me and my team risk fighting a squad in bottom 10 knowing that we only gain 3-10 rp before top 10, and have a chance of dying and losing even more? 

Not to mention when top 10 arrives circles are going to be significantly smaller and later into the game (because squads are doing their best to stay alive) meaning 3rd, 4th, and 5th parties are all the more prevalent.

You see the screenshots of people getting 5-10 kills and dying in 11s and LOSING RP in silver. That's completely absurd. 

The way RP is being given out creates a very boring, camping, and passive meta.

"""Three Strikes"" is probably the worst gamemode ever in Apex Legends","I've played 3 rounds of the new LTM ""Three Strikes"" so far and don't understand who thought this mode would be playable in that form.

I don't want to be a hater, I'm just trying to be honest; In all three rounds I ended up camping in a small building with 0 ammo and 0 meds, because nobody dies and so you can't loot anything. Overall I knocked 23 people in 3 games.

I mean honestly, how did the devs not think of that? In a mode where you pretty much can't die until the last zone, and thus have a lot more fights, you should either get a certain amount of ammo and healing items for each knock, or you should have infinite from the start.

Unfortunately, the LTM feels very rushed and unfinished and I don't think I will play any more of it, which is sad because I was pretty damn hyped when I saw the trailer :/

I want to clarify that 3 stacking makes climbing easier and that it is not easy for everyone to do. You just can't win with some teams, and some Randoms are the reason you can't win. I agree that this ranked season is harder then ever (possibly too hard in some areas), but that would just require minor fixes. For the love of god RESPAWN FIX THE VOICE CHAT IN THIS GAME. I am just going to go down the list of general complaints I see and say my counter arguments to them.

&#x200B;

# MY RANDOMS SUCK.

This is just true for some games so those games are not winnable, but not every game is winnable anyway. Lets think for a second. If you load into a game, don't talk or type, maybe ping once in a while, and then go in and try to fight full teams, what is the difference between you and the other Randoms in your squad? Nothing. YOU ARE the Randoms that you hate so much. In order to climb in this new system you need to adapt to what teammates you have. No one speaking? Become the IGL and tell them what to do. People running in to third a fight? Follow them because even if you all die it gives you a better chance to win the fight than as a 2v3. They want to play slow and prioritize placement? Don't run off on your own to look for fights.  Like I said, sometimes randoms just will not listen, run in, and die. I get them all the time, but you can't win every game. You just gotta make sure you gain more than you lose.

One of the biggest things you can do to win more games with Randoms is become the leader. Tell them what to do and tell them how you are going to win. It's a skill you need to learn and something I learned by watching Hal and Sweet in tournaments. I'm a broken record at this point, but if there is one take away from this entire post it's that in order to climb a LOT easier you need to become an IGL.

Here is a small example of how I IGL randoms to a win in a plat game.

[https://youtu.be/rfQ5UE-0OGo](https://youtu.be/rfQ5UE-0OGo)

# I DONT HAVE TIME.

Again, this is just true for some people and if you don't have the time to play games then that is a fair argument. Why should someone be able to climb if they don't have the time though? Like anything you do in life if you don't have the time for it then you aren't going to get better and improve. People who play sports are not going to get better if they don't play the sport often enough. If you want to get better and improve at something you have to make time for it or you are not going to achieve it. I work full time, which isn't as much of a time commitment as others, but I was still able to make the climb.

# THE NEW SYSTEM IS TOO HARD.

Yes it is. That's the point. To the people that got Masters congrats, that was still around the top of the bell curve and you deserve it. This new system just rewards you for playing smarter not more.  Masters is the top rank in Apex while Pred is the top 750 of Masters. Take other games for example: Overwatch's top rank was Grandmaster and only about 1% of players reached that. In League of Legends the top rank is Challenger and that's basically top .01%. The top rank should only be reached by the best players, not people who just play a lot. If you are not climbing in this new system then you simply are at the rank you deserve to be. I know I will get a lot of hate for saying it, but it's just the facts. The ONLY reason you should be allowed to climb is if you are improving. If you are not able to improve then you are the rank you belong at.

# THE MATCHMAKING IS BAD

Honestly, this is kind of true. Sometimes you get matched with people that are not in the same rank as you. As a plat 1 I've been matched with Silver 4 and Bronzes. But out of the 214 games I played this season I can only say 10 or so were with people that are not in the rank they deserve to be in. All other 200+ games have been with either Golds or Plats. So you can't blame a system when a vast majority of the time you are with teammates that are in the same rank as you + or - 1. If you honestly believe that a majority of the time you are getting put with unfair teammates, that means a lot of the lobby has the same issue, so why can't you beat the other teams that have similar level players?

# Final Thoughts

I personally think this new ranked system is the best it's ever been. I am having the most fun I've ever had on Apex in these games. Is the system perfect? No. There are certainly some changes they can make such as entry cost or and getting rid of split rank resets. You have to play completely different than you used to, and end games are more about being smart than having better aim.  You have to work with your Randoms, not just be in the same game as them. Is it easier to climb with a 3 man? Fuck yeah. I would love if I could play with a consistent three stack, but sadly I just outpace my friends a bit and my schedule is a little weird. In the end you have to play with the cards you are dealt, and you can either use those cards to make the best hand possible, or just complain and lose.

TLDR

* Become an IGL and adapt for your randoms if you want to win
* Improve when you play instead of just playing
* If you really want to improve at the game make time for it just like you would for anything else
* Don't underestimate yourself

480h in the game and I find this patch the worst what could happened to APEX,"They not only destroyed all the good parts of this game which made it special like:  

- using momentum for edge sliding and bunny hopping healing  

- accuracy while sliding  
   
- movements speed form balloon  

- sound lvl are even more broken now (with elite mode the distance you can heart shots is game breaking, if you start fight you will be sandwich hence people camp NON STOP)  

**ALL OF THIS CHANGES MADE GAME FEEL SOOOO SLOOOOW** and **KILLED THE CORE OF WHAT IT WAS**

but also screwing up by blocking **ENTIRE** graphic commands...   
it is a freaking joke!!!   
on 2080 RTX and 8700k I **CANNOT** hit constant **144fps** in 1440p and game **STUTTERS DURING THE FIGHTS!!!!**

I wont even start with all the new bugs they introduced... (visual glitches, caustic infinite q, sounds glitches, healing glitches and it has been only 10h since patch was introduced so I am sure more is coming)

This is by far the worst LTM respawn has ever made,"I already made one post about this but after playing even more I can say without any doubt whatsoever that this game mode is absolute garbage and has no redeeming qualities at all. It's so obvious that respawn just wanted a glorified shadow royal (a game mode they've had for YEARS) but ended up taking literally everything wrong with it and made it 10000x worse, while at the same time completely getting rid of everything that made it worth playing. This game mode requires absolutely no skill but instead 20+ people all working together, which is literally impossible with the apex player base. The movement is the best part but the maps not being designed for it, makes it completely useless at the best of times. The spawns are by far the worst I've ever seen from any online game I've ever played and whoever at respawn designed them, should be ashamed. The fact that on the revenant team you aren't allowed to use your heirloom unless you get incredibly lucky as the ""red eyed revenant"" is a complete scam. The entire game is rigged from the start in the legends favor. Ik this is a bit of a pointless rant, but I find it so incredibly hard to believe that the same developers that made 3 strikes made this pile of steaming horse shit.",apexlegends,1702100816.0,t3_18e6q9e

"You're not Shroud, please stop hot dropping!","I'm really new to Apex (about 15 hours), and my team hot dropping is making the game unplayable. I don't know if some streamer or youtuber recommended you hot drop every game, but the whole team dying in 40 sec isn't my idea of fun. When I'm jumpmaster and I don't hot drop my team screams at me, and will either jump solo or when we land they will beeline for the most crowded area and die within seconds, the whole time telling me I'm trash and threatening to report.

This weekend I played 93 games with 88 hot drops or team solo jumping when I didn't hot drop. I died unarmed 41 times and my team died in less than a minute 62 times.

Before anyone tells me to git gud, I've been playing fps since Quake 3 and CS 1.6 so my mechanics are solid. But I have no map knowledge and little hero knowledge, which I can't get since I spend more time in loading screens than playing the game.

"Not having solos(or duos) will kill this game faster than anything else. Before you downvote my evil opinion, try to read the post please.","I have played this game a lot, at a higher frequency I think I've ever played a game. It's probably my top 5 favorite games ever and has completely blown all of the other Battle Royales out of the water imo. I usually am able to play with one or two friends but sometimes I have to solo queue. That's when every ounce of enjoyment I was having with this game goes out the window. I'm sure everyone on this sub has heard all of the complaints about solos but it truly is the most frustrating thing on the planet playing with two people who don't give a flying fuck about anything other than themselves and looting. I'd say about 1 in 6/7 games I'll finally get 2 randoms or a duo who actually seems like they know what they're doing or care enough to try. So this brings me to my point. A simple solution is to AT LEAST make a duos game mode to filter those out and although it's not a popular opinion on this sub, I think a solo mode would make this game thrive because all of the solo minded people get filtered out and then you can solo queue into a squad match without getting matched with dickheads. I'm not sure how solos would be balanced but some form of it would please a lot of people I think. Duos is pretty simple, the player base is enormous so it should definitely be an option. I just want to consistently have fun when I solo queue :(",apexlegends,1554493876.0,t3_b9vso4
WE NEED SOLO!!!,I would like to start off by saying that i understand this game was not designed for solo play but we REALLY need it. Most of don't like to play apex and they are garbage anyway so the gets me stuck in fill praying i don't get a bunch of idiots. I was never really a big battle royal fan but the one thing i loved about it is that i could play solo and not worry about bad teammates. Me my skill and a little RNG  that is what i like about battle royal but i cant do that in apex. When it first came out it was not that bad because the only people who played where people who were generally good at video games. Now that the game had become very popular we have a flood of dumb 12 year old kids. I would not have a problem with this if i could just play solo but i cant. Here is 90% of my team fights. I kill someone need to reload and get destroyed by 2 other people who are full health. Without a good team most fights fell less like a 3v3 and more like a 1v3. I get it not everyone is a try hard and are just playing to have fun that is okay but i should not be forced to play with them. Please i love apex and the one problem i have been having with it since day one has been it not having a solo mode. ,apexlegends,1553133772.0,t3_b3ksmg

Unpopular Opinion: bunny hopping should be removed,"Basically the title says it all. Bunny hopping completely breaksdown the balance that slow movements while healing creates.

Edit: /u/metra101 said it better than me

>Exploiting engine mechanics to circumvent the explicitly-added risk aspect of healing in combat isn't ""skillful"". Anyone can make that reflex. The ""skill"" comes with knowing WHEN to heal in combat. The slow expands that ""skill"" because of the added risk. Bhopping removes that and just allows for easy heals.

Very Disappointed With This Group,"Just today, there was an illustrator who uploaded his artwork to this subreddit and…it looked nice, but it sure has flaws. Thankfully, you had those who provided constructive feedback for the artist, but, of course, not everyone has provided so. Some of you have made replies where they jump to very negative conclusions, like the artist is discriminating, a liar, a complete idiot, lazy, and so on. First of all, we don’t know this person. Second, doing something like this is not encouraging; it’s the usually the complete opposite. Third, you guys are certainly not better than those who are like, “lol, screw the haters who’re pushing their politics and ideologies on you” while not understanding why there are those who dislike the picture.

Speaking of which, to those who are claiming that these people (the ones jumping to these conclusions) are pushing their political ideologies and agendas to the artist: most of you aren’t better than the other folks. You guys have not made yourself look better and have shown that you don’t understand why some may not like it that much. I can absolutely say that none of these people have done such thing. Some/most of them have been providing feedback in a not-so-good-way, such as doubting the artist’s words, and, again, jumping to conclusions; that’s all. Plus, both of you guys have been starting debates about something that’s completely unrelated to the artwork itself while you guys fight with one another WHILE not understanding each other. Do you think the artist wants this; a debate about something unrelated to the picture? No. Do you think the artist wants the comment section to be locked by the moderators (because of people fighting)? No, because I bet the artist wants to hear nothing but feedback for the illustration. And I don’t think the admins nor the moderators want to see people fighting. Does the artist mean well? Judging by the way the artist responded to people who provided highly detailed, constructive feedback, I’m gonna have to say yes. The artist even apologized for the flaws of the illustrations, and yet people downvoted his responses and treated him like a liar which probably made him feel worse.

Now, due to this, the artist removed the illustration itself. Not only that, but the artist also removed his account completely. I nor anyone can’t check to see if the OP’s account is a troll account where it was created just to cause reactions from other people or whatever now. I bet the artist doesn’t wanna upload anything online anymore and/or doesn’t want to draw any more darker skinned characters for a long time or, worse, ever again because of what happened today. If any of you guys wanted to provide feedback to the artist, fine, but you shouldn’t jump to any conclusions; especially, negative ones. While at it, absolutely don’t accuse the artist for being discriminating without any evidences (or whatever) that may prove something and/or having any ideas about who he is and what his attentions are. Let’s not forget, and I should not be saying this at all, that the moderators, the admins and the developers of this game just want people to get along.

**Somewhat short version:** someone made a fanart out of one of the characters of this game; Lifeline. The way it was drew and coloured was…flawed (if that’s the right term to use). People here began to treat the artist like someone who is discriminating, a liar, lazy and so on. Soon, people began to have debates about something that’s completely unrelated to the picture itself. While at it, you have people providing feedback, but, unfortunately, some of them have also been doing so WHILE jumping to negative conclusions and the artist in the intentions behind the artwork. This lead to the removal of the artwork itself by the artist himself. He even deleted his own Reddit account. Now, he probably doesn’t want to upload any of his artworks ever again on any websites, and, while at it, doesn’t wanna draw anymore darker skinned characters because he is probably worried that he may start another controversy. I highly recommend that you read the whole thing just you understand, almost, exactly what I’m talking about.",apexlegends,1678936499.0,t3_11sikzl
Arenas need to be Re-Added to Apex,"Arenas was the Only true 1v1 Mode in Apex. It was good for practicing and getting better. And it was just overall strategic and more dependent on playing as a smart. You could actually get clean 1v1 fights and practice your skill.

Can we talk about how broken / overpowered pathfinder feels?,"Fighting a pathfinder was always a struggle, specially if he is somewhat skilled. 

&#x200B;

Pathfinder has:

\- The best skill in the game, there is simply no contest here, being able to get away or get high ground with a single button is incredibly powerful when it comes to positioning in a game where positioning is extremely important, also servers as a free get out of here card.

\- Wonky hitbox, I can consistently hit wraiths with the wingman but when it comes to pathfinders its like the bullets go through the guy, I dont know what is going on with his hitbox but when I actively try to hit him a big percentage of the shots whiff even though I am clearly seeing the bullets hit him. I also have gotten random ass headshots on pathfinders when I know I shouldnt of gotten it, is his head hitbox where it visually looks it like it is at?

\- Only legend I cant hear at all when he is full sprinting towards me, I have had pathfinders sneak up behind me and shoot me point blank before I know they are there, this ONLY happens with pathfinder.

\- I just played pathy, the middle reticle he gets for his skill is SO SO GOOD to hit hip fire shots with any gun, but it is specially good for hip firing with the wingman, just an unnecessary advantage to an already a little too strong legend.

\- His passive is way too good in high level ranked play, knowing where the circle is going to close lets you choose your positioning extremely well which is a huge advantage in the last circles of ranked play.",apexlegends,1568232554.0,t3_d2w5j6

Unpopular Opinion: Apex Legends is waaaaay overrated...,"I know this won't be too popular here but I've got to say this.

There's two parts to Battle Royale.

1. Combat

2. Non combat (map traversal/looting)

That's it.  All BR games boil down to those two sections.

The combat in Apex Legends is fine.  It feels like a typical Call of Duty/Overwatch.  You shoot at eachother and you use abilities.  It's fine.  It's good.  It's...nothing to write home about.

The non combat in Apex Legends is what will kill this game.  Right now, games last 20 minutes or so.  A typical combat encounter lasts 15 seconds.  If you get into 5 encounters during a match that's 1 minute and 15 seconds of action...in a game that lasts 20 minutes.

In other words, Apex Legends has players in non combat for 18 minutes and 45 seconds on average.  Respawn Entertainment has not made non combat interesting enough in this game.  The looting/map traversal is a complete bore and it will catch up to Apex Legends eventually.

Prediction: Apex Legends will be the hottest BR game for the next two - three months.  After that honeymoon period, Fortnite will grab most players attention back.

"Respawn doesn't need a new lead balancer, the community needs a perspective change.","This is in response to one of the top posts on the subreddit right now. Before you hit the downvote, just hear me out.

Daniel Klein has become the public enemy for the Apex community. I'm asking for change here, because I don't believe he deserves the toxicity and disrespect he gets on a daily basis. He initially reached out to the reddit community to respond to patch note concerns and questions. His responses were generally well received. But as soon as he gives an unpopular opinion, everyone freaks out. Why are we punishing developers who are reaching out in good faith to help the community by retaliating as soon as he says something you disagree with?

Also, what makes any one of us think that we could do his job better? You really think you know what changes to make that would make the whole player base happy, down from the noobiest player to the top preds? That's a lot of people to keep happy.

Don't you think Respawn developers are actively watching and tracking statistics to keep the game alive and healthy? This is their job, after all. They're probably fully aware that if they make too many wrong moves, the game dies and the developers may be on the cutting block in an already crazy job market that is the Gaming industry.

Do you think Daniel is really the only problem here? I understand that maybe he's not doing his job perfectly, but do you think everyone at Respawn just lets him do whatever he wants? He's got a coworker that is also in charge of balancing, John Larson. Why aren't we burning him at the stake too? If Daniel was really actually screwing things up for the game, no businessmen worth a dime at EA or Respawn would think twice about firing him. Have you not noticed that Apex has been doing extremely well on Twitch? And that most, if not, all legends ARE actually fun and unique to play? In my estimation, that means that maybe Respawn, including Daniel, is really doing something right.

Lastly, just because a majority of people here hate on Daniel and the other developers doesn't mean that's how the rest of the world feels. There are plenty of people that don't give two cents for what we say on this subreddit and they love and enjoy the game anyway. We're likely a minority compared to the rest of the player base.

I'll conclude by saying that it's okay to disagree with decisions that Respawn and the devs make. But name calling? Death threats and insults? Harassment? Over a game? Come on, man.",apexlegends,1628128283.0,t3_oy7kzw

"As a high level player on both PC and Console, I'm so sick of this argument over whether controller players have an advantage over mouse players in Apex...","**Warning, this is a long post, but I think it needs to be address all of this.** I play in Pred lobbies on both PC and Console, and have played at that level with *both* a controller and a mouse. I have years of experience on both mouse and controller at a near pro level in multiple games. To me, it seems ridiculous to claim controller has an advantage over mouse. Let's go over a few things to put this all in perspective.

# The fact that controller players occupy the top Pred Spots right now is not telling of anything.

Someone cherry picked a single moment where there were a lot of controller players and ignored all the other times that there were more mouse players as if for some reason they hold no bearing in the argument. In fact I looked today and noticed a few controller players had fallen out. More importantly though, ***this list doesn't say a whole lot about controller vs mouse advantage***. Being the top Pred is not about having the highest skill. It's about putting in the most hours because the system is broken at the top level and doesn't look purely at skill but more at who grinds the most for points. Obviously you still have to be exceptionally good, and controller players may have an advantage here because playing with a controller is less taxing, and so they can play more hours, but this is a pretty poor way of making any judgement about controller vs mouse, especially since the list has been the opposite for much of the past and people are just conveniently ignoring that. No one threw up a red flag any of the times the majority of the list were mouse players.

# All you have to do to instantly throw the entire argument in doubt is play in a Pred PC lobby and then go play in a Pred console lobby

The difference is night and day. PC lobbies are significantly harder and it's not really subjective. People move so much faster and do crazy things you never see on console. You get lasered from range in ways that never happen on console. The entire reason I play with a controller now is I can't convince my Pred teammates to play with me on PC anymore because it feels unfair and less fun to them. In fact, **there are currently cheaters that are using a glitch to get into console lobbies while using a mouse - just so they can get to Pred easier.** They are dominating these lobbies. Does that sound like controllers are broken? Controller players on PC do fare a little better because they can use Steam to bind their stick to WASD for instant movement like keyboard and use macros for tap strafe. People also say console is easier because the players are just better on PC. That sounds a little elitest to me, but I guess it's reasonable to claim the best controller players move to PC for because it's required to compete in tournaments and such.

# The only thing I've personally seen that controllers are arguably better at is fighting up close when movement isn't too much faster than a strafe dance.

This is because you don't move far enough to travel outside the aim assist zone, so aim assist helps a lot. Any movement more severe than your standard strafe dance though and a mouse has an advantage. This is because with a controller, either you have a low sens so you can beam but then you can't move fast enough to track large fast movements, or you have a high sens and then a lot of your benefits of aim assist are gone. The highest level of players skew the data a little more towards controller players though because they play on a high sens and often on linear which gives even more of an advantage, but high sens linear is *exceptionally* difficult to master. Go try Genburten's settings (hipfire yaw and pitch 500, ADS yaw and pitch 130, *everything* else at zero). I would bet money that without a ton of practice *you can't even hold your crosshair still no matter how hard you try!* Pros play so many hours though that they can master it. You're very unlikely to see that advantage in your games. I will say from personal experience that you see significantly more shotguns on PC, which is telling that controller players do not have a general all around advantage close range.

# There's already plenty of evidence that there isn't a significant advantage even close range.

Respawn already came out and said something along the lines of all their data shows there isn't a significant advantage close range on controller. There wording wasn't clear on whether there was an advantage at all, but it was clear that it wasn't significant. On top of that, there was a guy here on Reddit that did a statistical study where he looked at every kill in the ALGS to compare how mouse players fared against controller players. It was surprisingly close, but he found that mouse players in the pros had beaten controller players more often at *every* range, *even up close*. The only difference was controller players at the pro level were significantly more likely to one-clip their opponent (even though they lost more over all). It just so happens though that you notice when you get one clipped - but you don't notice all those times you killed the controller players when they failed to one-clip you - which feeds the biased narrative.

# Most of the ""evidence"" I've seen that there is an advantage is twisted and obviously biased.

I've seen claims like this before that all the top players are all controller players, but when I look it up I find that while there are a number of well known controller players at the top, the majority are actually still mouse players. I can't speak to this time as I haven't gone through each player and don't know most of them, but the claim is always a little questionable because I personally know of no way to tell who's on controller and who's on mouse unless they're a pro or a streamer, and quite often the top players are neither.

People also talk about how mouse players are all switching to controller in tournaments - but I don't know of a single pro player that has done that permanently, which is telling. I do know a few very good controller players that switched to mouse though.

I also see people pointing to the 1v1 tournament by GDolphn all the time, saying ""all four of the finalists were controller players!"" Well, that's a lie. Two were mouse players and two were controller players. I don't know why people thought Rogerboger was a controller player, but at least one of the semi-finalists was ImperialHal who played on mouse against mouse players and controller against controller players for fun. Calling him a controller player is a stretch and his placement says nothing because he swapped inputs every time to match his opponent. People also fail to mention that many of the best controller players went out early, or that in the second tournament a mouse player won, or that in the third tournament, even though the finalists were controller players again, Genburten was beaten by a mouse player. 1v1 tournaments are a poor judge too because it's literally an entire tournament where you're purposely limited to fighting only in the exact manner that controllers have the best chance of competing - close 1v1 strafe battles.

# There are legitimate arguments here, but my biggest gripe is how stupid people sound when they say things like... 

**""There's so much aim assist in Apex""**

Apex actually has less aim assist than most console shooters. Go play CoD and compare the aim assist to Apex. It's night and day.


**""Controller players should be forced to play with no aim assist on PC""**

Saying there should be *no* aim assist is just stupid. By saying that, you're basically saying, ""I want to dominate every controller player stupid enough to ever try playing in a PC lobby. I want to make trying to play a few games with their PC friends to be an absolutely miserable experience."" If you played Gun Game on controller this week, you would know it was ridiculously hard to hit anything with the knife. A lot of that was because there was no aim assist on the knife for controllers. You cannot compete without aim assist on a controller. It killed Counter-Strike on console - one of the most popular PC games of all time - because Valve listened to mouse players and didn't put it in the game. Saying you think close range aim assist should be tweaked is fine and understandable, but saying no aim assist is ignorant.


**""Controller takes no skill because aim assist aims for you""**

*This is the absolute dumbest thing I ever hear people say around here*. Again, go try Genburten's settings and tell me that's easy or it aims for you, and he's arguably the best out there. Obviously some people are are more inclined to controllers and will pick it up easier, but for me, a mouse was much easier to master than controller. It might be accurate to say the skill floor is easier on a controller than a mouse, but I can't really say for sure because I learned controller second and mouse was very easy for me. At the same time, I've tried for *years* to get as good at controller as mouse and I can't. Using a mouse still feels like easy mode to me comparatively. So when you say something like that, and there are tons of people in this community that try and try to aim with a controller and just can't, and people like me that have tried and tried to master aiming with a controller and can't, do you know how dumb you sound?

# So in summary:

I'm open to the idea that maybe some day we'll actually get some hard evidence and find controllers have some degree of advantage over mouse players, but most evidence I've seen says otherwise right now. I can see saying things right now like Respawn needs to tweak close range aim assist to reduce one-clips because it's legitimately frustrating and feels unfair, while acknowledging the evidence above that shows controller players *aren't* winning more overall, even close range. However, saying things like aim assist is doing the majority of aiming for controller players, controllers take no skill, controllers players should be forced to play without aim assist, or even that controller players are out of control and dominating mouse players without some kind of real evidence is just profoundly stupid. Please stop saying these things. Thank you.",apexlegends,1664915982.0,t3_xvq1bq

Apex Culture - New Player First Game Reported for ‘Sabotage’,"Alright this is going to be a short post. To be clear from the start, no offense but I don’t give a sh*t about being reported, I just wanted to use this as a learning moment for us all. 

I’ve seen plenty of clips of Apex over the years, I’ve always had interest in checking it out but never really sat down and gave it a go.

Last night I play the very first match in arena. Literally the first time I’ve ever played after spending some time in the training grounds. I’m pretty decent at FPSs in general, IMO every single one has its own learning curve.

During this match last night, I struggled to get kills at first. Frankly still completely adjusting to the controls and the weapons which I know a grand total of nothing about. 

I don’t have a mic on and didn’t plan on it. But the two dudes on my team start talking about their third teammate and I hear it after literally the FIRST round: “He doesn’t even have any damage. I’m going to report this guy for sabotage.”

THE FIRST ROUND. Obviously a part of me hears this and is like, well hell, I want to do damage and earn some points but, Jesus, this is literally the first time I’ve ever played. 

I wanted to get my mic working. I am longtime gamer and I wasn’t going to give them some big condescending speech, but I wanted to say to these two: “Jesus Christ y’all new players are always going to be a thing, and everyone is brand new at some point.”

But they just kept complaining as the match went on, even after I got damage and a couple frags lol. Then it was almost like disappointment, oh he clearly actually is trying, but reported anyway lol. They did report me. I did seem to get my mic on and told them they need to chill, everyone is new sometimes, but at that point they went silent of course lol.

TL;DR Let new people suck at Apex before you go around reporting them for ‘sabatoge’  - you certainly sucked at some point as well.

Like it will literally force my aim to stay on someone when I’m fighting. And I was wondering what’s the slowdown and it’s 60 percent that’s not aim assist that’s a crutch like anybody with a brain beams on console it’s so low skill it hurts and idk why console players don’t ask for it to be lowered because to me it’s in fun knowing I’m better than somebody but they kill me in the 1v1 or 1v2 because they have soft aim hacks basically

The Logical View on the Tap-Strafe ban.,"Hi,
I'm going to keep this short and simple. All of this is coming from someone who plays ranked at almost the highest level, across multiple platforms. I played on PC for a few months, PS4 for a few months, Switch for a week (garbage, I'm sorry), and I've been on Xbox ever since I transitioned from Halo 5 competitive to Apex on launch.

Tap Strafing is an unintended feature, and that's the base of this argument. If we look back to some other unintended features, we've got: Bunnyhopping while healing, Zipline jumping (constant without cooldown), and Fall Stun denial (where you melee the ground as soon as you hit it). Those were all relatively game breaking and essentially made certain movement legends useless per their abilities. Each legend has a certain playstyle tailored to them, whether they be movement legends, defensive legends, and support legends. A feature shouldn't negate the importance of generic and skillful movement. Tapstrafing never took a chunk of skill to use, neither did those other long lost unintended features, or, from here on out per definition, an exploit.

The backlash from the community is absolutely absurd over the removal of a movement exploit, and people need to realize that they shouldn't be mad at the fact it's getting removed, they should be mad at Respawn for not removing it as quickly as they removed the other exploits. People got way too comfortable with tap strafing and in their mind think it's an intended feature. It's not. It's the act of spamming a movement input to abuse the logic of the game to keep momentum while making sharp turns. 

The other end of the backlash consists of ""Oh, they're catering to causal players/console/controller players"". 1, not everyone can afford a PC who wants to play at the highest level, and 2, a larger playerbase is across console, not PC, including high level console players. The harassment the controller/console player is absolutely unwarranted and those harassing them are creating such an unnecessary divide in the community. Why should a needed feature such as aim assist also be removed because an exploit was removed for the PC players? Yeah, it looks sick to tapstrafe, but it has nothing to do with aim assist. ""It's the only way to counter AA!"", No, no it isn't. Good movement without tapstrafing and good aim can counter a controller player. We shine better at close range fights, so keep it long range, don't get cocky. Apex also has the weakest aim assist across a vast majority of games, such as CoD, Fortnite, Halo, Overwatch, and more. Respawn should fix the exploits when they happen, not later and push it off. For example, they should fix the animation cancel that is limited to only controller players.... That shit is actually nasty and unfair.

I know the hate I'm going to get for this, but I wouldn't put this argument out if I wasn't willing to atleast accept some because I know not everyone agrees with everyone's opinions, and I know I'm gonna piss a lot of people off by atleast trying to provide enough information from a logical, unbiased standpoint.
Hopefully some of y'all agree, but as well as stopping the divide in the community. We all love games, don't let what platform we play on tear us apart.

"I don't understand the hate with the change to ranked, as it make sense to me","The duality of MMR and ranking make sense to me.

My MMR defines how good I am at FPS (aim, movement, etc..), it ensure that my enemy in all my matches have roughly the same level as me. Any team I encounter we should have a chance to beat 3v3.

The ranking defines how good I was this season at surviving in a battle royal. Any match were I died before half the team I lose points. Any match were I was surviving more than that I win some points.

This make the gunfight enjoyable, no matter if it's the start of the season or the end. I should not end up fighting a better player just because it's his first few matches of the season and he's in silver and climbing.

"This community is wild, downvote all you like","I've probably been gaming for the better part of 23 years of my 28 years on this planet, and Apex's Community is literally the only one I've ever seen where people think having a FASTER tkk is LESS skillful. Like, I don't get it. I've played everything from Quake, to CS 1.6, to Siege, to Planetside 2 and other ""Tanky"" shooters. How in the WORLD does having a faster TTK (Thus requiring better aim and positioning) somehow LOWER the skill ceiling? Because you can't abuse a level 4 Shield and face tank a full mag, hide behind a rock, use one battery and then do it again? My god, I've never seen a more whiny bunch of people.

The new Shields and faster TTK requires MORE skill. It requires MORE precision in aiming, and it requires BETTER positioning. I've heard a few streamers and ""top"" players saying they can't reliably 1v3 anymore, among other things because of the new TTK. This isn't a bad thing, this isn't LOWERING the skill gap. It's requiring you to better plan out your battles. If you get caught in a 1v3, statistically you should be ready to accept your defeat, unless you have better aim and movement. This can be said for ANY video game. You SHOULD NOT be able to ""reliably"" take on several players by yourself solely because your Shield has a faster heal rate or just more HP in general.

The reason a lot of people started to enjoy Apex (I would know, I play with several of them) is because the higher TTK meant they actually stood a chance because their aim wasn't that great. Having more health + slower TTK BENEFITS bad players. It actively LOWERS the skill required because someone can just face tank bullets while their teammates shoot you.

As I said, downvote me all you want, disagree with me all you want.

A core decision during development of Apex Legends was that we wanted to make a world class battle royale game - in quality, depth, progression, and important for today’s conversation - how we sell stuff. With the Iron Crown event we missed the mark when we broke our promise by making Apex Packs *the only* way to get what many consider to be the coolest skins we’ve released\*.\*

&#x200B;

We’ve heard you and have spent a lot of time this week discussing the feedback and how we structure events in the future, as well as changes that we will make to Iron Crown. To get right into it, here are the changes we are making:

&#x200B;

* Starting on 8/20, we’ll be adding and rotating all twelve of the event-exclusive Legendary items into the store over the course of the final week of the event for the regular Legendary skin cost of 1,800 Apex Coins. You will still be able to purchase Iron Crown Apex Packs for 700 Apex Coins if you choose. The store schedule for the week will be as follows:

* For future collection events, we will provide more ways to obtain items than just buying Apex Packs. 

&#x200B;

A couple other things I would like to address:

We need to be better at letting our players know what to expect from the various event structures in Apex Legends. Over the last six months we’ve been learning a lot about operating a live service free-to-play game, and one of the take-aways from this week (beyond what was mentioned above) is that our messaging for expectations needs to be clearer. This is a different event structure than the Legendary Hunt from Season 1, and it will be different from planned future upcoming events. We’re learning more each day on what works, what doesn’t, and how to provide the best possible experiences and content to all of you.

With Apex Legends it is very important to us that we don’t sell a competitive advantage. Our goal has not been to squeeze every last dime out of our players, and we have structured the game so that all players benefit from those who choose to spend money - events like Legendary Hunt or Iron Crown exist so that we can continue to invest in creating more free content for all players. This week has been a huge learning experience for us and we’re taking the lessons forward to continue bringing the best possible experience to all of you.

Thanks again for being a part of the Apex Legends community, we look forward to continuing to release awesome new stuff for everyone to enjoy!",apexlegends,1565990904.0,t3_crcrxy

Can we please start fighting again...,"I know with the new ranked system ratting is the way but for the love of god, can we please have more gunfights. 

9/10 matches I solo Q, only one teammate will slightly push with me, while the other, (most of the time a loba,) Q's away, we go down and then I'm stuck spectating because the loba either grabbed my banner or crafted it. With only a  -35 entry cost you think more people would be willing to engage in fights. 

Same goes with other teams. I'll push on a team and they will literally rotate to the other side of the map to avoid a fight. People playing fortnite shoot more bullets then Apex players these days like wtf?

The game is a blood sport... let there be blood involved please. 

PS- Some simple ways to keep people engaged in fights besides the obvious of changing how ranked works:

1) Remove the ability for the entire team to craft banners and revert back to only support players having that ability.

2) Make EVAC towers less accessible.

3) Rework Loba. The only person she ""supports"" now is herself.",apexlegends,1684939326.0,t3_13qnn2f
How is Apex Legends community so hateful about inclusivity when game has been like this since season 1?,"No but seriously, it is weird. I get people are hateful and I don't expect everyone to have morals and shit but Apex Legends had non binary and gay legend since season 1, had inclusivity ever since it got released but people complains everytime when they include someone new who wasn't represented? How? You knew this game was like this and no one forced you to play it if it bothered you that much. If you don't like the art/character concept, why do you play it. It is just video game at the end and their sexuality or look has nothing to do with gameplay if that's what you enjoy. If it makes someone happy that their kind is included, why are you mad about that? lmao. If it was CSGO or some shit, I would get it but it makes no sense for Apex",apexlegends,1679675164.0,t3_120pe2a

As a casual player with little time...I like the SBMM.,"There I've said it.

Ever since it was introduced my K/D has gone from .67 to .74 and is still going up. 
I'm averaging three to five kills in a match unlike before when I was maybe getting one to two, if I was lucky.

Is every match sweaty? Very nearly yes, my palms are gripped to the controller, my adrenaline is up and I'm loving it. 
I'm not a hardcore player, I play ranked strictly for the bragging right over my friends only.
I'm a play when I get a little bit of time, stay at home father of three (two of which are 20 months and 7 months respectively). I had stopped playing the game for more than a month (after it being my go-to since release) because I was getting stomped without a friend being there to back me up and now I feel confident that even when my team is dead that I can have a chance to wipe the other squad, recover mine and revive them.

SBMM is the best thing to happen to Apex since Bloodhound's Eyes of the All Father tracking fix.",apexlegends,1578937055.0,t3_eo7d1p
SBMM and how your complaining makes no sense,So someone please help me understand this. Everyone complains that they are “200 wins” or +2kd and they get matched with players under level 30 and the champion squad is premade preds. If everyone is complaining that they’re getting matched with lower level players then doesn’t that mean that most of the lobby would be low level players? Maybe I’m just lucky but the complaining here seems way over exaggerated. Of course there’s always going to be lobbies with premade preds with 20 kill badge 4K damage etc. It’s always been that way. Let’s not pretend though that every lobby you’re loading into is this way though. Until someone posts an uncut hour long video of 7-8 straight champions in pubs this way I’ll continue to call the complaints bs.  I guess that’s just the reddit way though.

I fucking hate little kids,"I honestly HATE, HATE LITTLE KIDS THAT PLAY ANY VIDEO GAMES AT ALL! They always ruin my experience in apex because they just suck like absolutely SUCK. I have been matchmaking everyday and rarely find people who have hair on their balls.
They are always loot hogs and they come in just in time to loot as I wipe out the squad.
In general kids are just toxic in my opinion and none of my friends play apex so I can't play apex with friends. I know I am going to get downvoted to hell but I'm just here to share my frustration. I play apex to escape from my life, relax and not worrying all the time but it seems like that is not how it is going so far.

Iron Crown And Its Update I can SMELL THE BS and I am going to RIP this apart ... Respectfully.,"I am actually upset and extremely disappointed that you have become marred by EA ... though we knew it was inevitable ... And your Iron Crown update MAKES NO SENSE ... Your apology and the event itself STINKS OF BS and so does your update and I am going to explain exactly why PEOPLE STILL SHOULD NOT BUY THE COSTUMES OR THE BOXES PERIOD.

 ""At launch we made a promise to players that we intend to do monetization in a way that felt fair and provided choice to players on how they spent their money and time"" 

""With the Iron Crown event we missed the mark when we broke our promise by making Apex Packs *the only* way to get what many consider to be the coolest skins we’ve released*.""*

1. *You never kept or even started that promise to begin with ... explain to me why the skins that are in the store currently are worth 18$ ? And I will tell you why they are worth 10$ at BEST. And when u compare them to these Iron Crown skins your trying to sell for the same price ?! Please don't quit your day job to become a comedian, because your not funny.*
2. You never ""MISSED THE MARK"" you got caught with your hand WAY too deep into peoples wallets and did the ""We're Sorry"" EA tactic ... No one is falling for it except for the whales. 

 ""Starting on 8/20, we’ll be adding and rotating all twelve of the event-exclusive Legendary items into the store over the course of the final week of the event for the regular Legendary skin cost of 1,800 Apex Coins. You will still be able to purchase Iron Crown Apex Packs for 700 Apex Coins if you choose. ""

1.  This update makes no sense ? So now if you want all the skins you STILL have to buy the boxes for 170$ ? or if you want the Legendary Skin's separate you can for 18$ each !? which if you were to buy all 12 would cost you 216$ !? EVEN MORE than if you were to buy the boxes !? you don't explain that one because you want the whales to fall for that little pit don't you ? Also, now if someone falls for that they STILL wont get the Bloodhound Weapon because they only bought the 12 Legendary Skins for 216$ and did not get the 12 EPICS .... SO HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE !? 
2. I noticed you try to MASK your devious monetization tactic's with good will to justify the implementation of them ... You made sure to tell us all about SOLOS!!! and then very little info about the event surrounding it. And you even made sure SOLO's was TEMPORARY and ends the exact same time as the EVENT ITSELF. Introducing SOLO'S was just a ""TOOL"" you used to get the most eyes on your Iron Crown Loot boxes as possible so that the whales would purchase these boxes. You even did the WERE GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU IF YOU DON'T BUY IT IN 7 DAYS tactic.
3. You guys make 24 million dollars a month apparently ... is that NOT enough ?! how much do you need to make to make investors happy ... 10 billion !? This WAS/IS the time to make your FANS happy so your INVESTORS can keep seeing that 24 million dollars every month and be happy. Instead your investors never ending GREED is backfiring and now I won't doubt you begin to make even less than that with this stunt.
4. The Wildlands Expansion is how this stuff is supposed to be done its supposed to be GIVEN AWAY or EARNED in game without monetary transactions. If you made 95 Million month one and make 24 Million more every month ... then GIVING AWAY those costumes does NOTHING to hurt you monetarily. YOU DID NOT NEED AND DO NOT NEED TO MAKE MONEY OFF THEM. At 24 million a month your already making enough money per month to give out some content for FREE. Most company's games don't see that kind of money in the games LIFETIME ... and your game is seeing it every month ... YOUR JUST GREEDY AND YOUR INVESTORS ARE JUST GREEDY.

 ""With Apex Legends it is very important to us that we don’t sell a competitive advantage. Our goal has not been to squeeze every last dime out of our players.""

1. You DO sell competitive advantage ... some guns have upgraded sights on them that make it far easier to hit your opponents than the normal iron sights ... STOP LYING ... no one is falling for it again ... except the whales.
2. You have been doing NOTHING but squeezing ... You even did the 33% OFF tactic to try and milk your player base for the NON IRON CROWN costumes because you KNEW they would not buy them after seeing the IRON CROWN skins. You never bring out patches that address balance problems ... only when a new season arrives. You add like a single weapon to the game in the entire time its been around. But yet that store kept getting updates and price reductions to try to squeeze the whales into buying them. Iron Crown sure came out with 170$ of DLC but ZERO BALANCE CHANGES to the games many issues. Disruptor Rounds ... still broken ... Energy Weapons ... you gave them a bigger clip ... for REAL !? ... JUST SPRAY AND PRAY HUH ? but god forbid someone actually uses some skill and hits you with a Wingman ... LOL who are we kidding no one uses the Wingman now with that 4 shot clip. 

Hope this helps ya see where we the players are coming from before one of your dev's decides to call us ASS-HATS again.Hope this shows you why your update and the whole thing to begin with was an issue and that we seen right through you from the beginning.  Hopefully this helps you see why your losing your player base and will prolly start losing that 24 Million Dollars a month. Hopefully whatever you robbed from the whales for this Iron Crown event was worth it.",apexlegends,1566093303.0,t3_crv96c
Let's have Loba be able to Loot her teammates banners,"Hear me out. 
Make the ultimate Cooldown a little longer, but grant her that utility. It would be counterable as she can still be spotted based on the trails, and she only gets two spots so she's trading her ult for her teammates.
It still needs her to find and use a respawn beacon too, so just looting the teammates banners isn't an automatic respawn. Finally it matches her character as a clever thief.",apexlegends,1670446018.0,t3_zfd9dq

This rank system is the worst its ever been,"**A emphasis on top 10:**

In the average rank, due to entry cost, if you are top 10 you are positive and if you aren't you are negative. This puts a heavy emphasis on getting top 10 which promotes ratting. 

Counter argument:

An emphasis on top 10 doesn't mean it promotes ratting, ratting isn't the same thing as playing smart.

My response:

Regardless of the wording you use the outcome is the same, people are forced to play for top 10 and that can mean ratting or playing smart. Placement should be heavily rewarded but because of the heavy heavy emphasis in results in boring gameplay and ratting. 

**Demotion Protection:**

Demotion protection are the 3 games you get to be positive before you are at risk of demotion and once you exhaust all your protection you will drop to half the tier below you. Its extremely unnecessary and punishing. In a normal rank system, like Overwatch, if you fall below a rank cut off you drop to whatever the cost of the game is. If I'm 3500, which is masters, and I loose 30 SR I will drop to 3460. The demotion that is implemented in apex season 13 drops you below what would be a normal cost of the game. If I'm in plat 4 and I exhaust my demotion protection and I'm still negative I'd drop to half of gold 1 which is around 300 RP. Those 4 games that I was negative I have the maximum to loose 204. Loosing more than the cost of the game is unnecessary and way to punishing. 

Counter argument:

The amount of RP you would loose from those 4 games would be the same, I see nothing wrong with this system. 

My response:

No, the RP you loose from demoting is much higher than the cost of those 4 games. Maximum of 204 versus 300. 

**Skill Grouping:**

In season 13 ranks that should not be together are grouped together. Plat has the ability to group with silver, gold has the ability to group with bronze. The difference between plat 4 and silver 4 is 27 RP. This would be equivalent to a diamond player being able to play with a bronze player in the previous system. 

**Solo Queuing:** 

Because of this system solo queuing is a nightmare. As a solo I usually get teamed with a duo where one is my rank and the other is multiple ranks lower. The worse player will of course make a mistake because they don't belong in the rank and because of the high entry costs I get punished heavily. In plat 4 I've been grouped with a duo who is gold and bronze and the result is always -51.

Side Note: Because of the way grouping is and the higher entry costs I am forced to play against top pred level players while in diamond with my gold and bronze team mate. My demotion game my entire squad was destroyed by slurpee, gild and sweet. 3 professional players in top 100 pred. How can I be expected to grind and climb when I'm facing people who way above mine and my teams skill level? Why do I get grouped with a bronze while in plat, face against 3 professional players and then loose 51 because of it???

Counter argument:

Just get good, the better you are the easily it will be for you to climb.

My response:

I am good, I've been multi masters each season and have went off against multiple pros. The demotion game I had I wouldve won my 1v1 against slurpee but sweet and gild came to help after my team died. Plat is extremely easy when I'm not facing preds. I deserve to be in high diamond, maybe masters in this new season but I don't have the time nor the motivation to put in 50+ hours (even longer solo queueing). 

**Emphasis on Grinding:** 

The high entry cost and the cost of the rank results in an immense grind. Play time does not equal skill and you should not be forced to play an unreasonable amount of time to get to the rank you deserve. For example, Sweetdreams who is a professional player and IGL for NRG, had to put in 36 hours and 100s of games to reach pred, the rank he belongs. His world record for pred in the previous season was 13 hours which is insane. The split doesn't work and has never worked. In a normal functioning ranked system, like overwatch, there are placement matches which function to keep players where they should be. As an example at the start of each season in overwatch there are placement matches, professional players would be placed in apex equivalent to masters and be forced to play a number of games before they can reach apex pred. Placement matches would fix this issue entirely, the next split will force everyone down and force everyone to grind again. 

Counter argument:

People should be forced to put in the time to gain a higher rank, you can expect to hop in a game and be good at it. 

My response:

This system isn't the same has putting in effort to reach a higher rank, it artificially creates a grind that is unnecessary, boring and unrewarding. Sweet is at the top of his game and has put the hours in, why should he have to play so much just to reach the rank he deserves. In a normal rank system as you put in more time you may learn more and climb the ranks but in this system regardless of your skill level you still have to put the time in. 

**Conclusion:**

Due to the frustrating aspects like grouping, not enough diamonds so preds face against plats and an emphasis on grinding this season has been the worst ranked experience as a solo queuer I've seen.",apexlegends,1653686493.0,t3_uz85mb

Just wanted to touch upon some of the diversity within this game,"Hey guys!  
I know it's a pretty sensitive topic and people always just like to respond to these kinda posts with ""just play the game,"" but I do appreciate Apex's vision and helping try to include different representation especially within a community as diverse as gamers are trying to get everyone to have representation is really great from them. As an Indian guy myself, we don't really see that much representation within the context of media and for the longest time I never thought it was that serious. However, seeing recent media trends of characters like obviously in Apex Rampart, and VALORANT having Harbor, the spiderman movie having Pravitr Prabhakar, really made me kind of recount on it seeing as even if it didn't have a huge impact on me specifically, the people around me started talking about it more. I think that if you don't really care about it, but for some people they enjoy feeling represented there is a net positive that comes from having that type of interaction and character lore happening in the game.  


I mean seriously we have Gibby a kind of stereotypical tank looking character who has Samoan heritage and is LGBTQ+

Bloodhound being non-binary as well as just an overall sick character lmao.  


There's Rampart as an Indian character, Valkyrie who is Half Japanese, half white, Lifeline being Jamican and much more that I could write a whole nother post on.

This community needs to chill,"I'm not one to usually defend respawn but Im also sick and tired of the community being so passive aggressive towards them after they finally listened. Anyone who is complaining that Respawn didn't bring back Winterfest express LTM this year need to stop acting like a pampered 3 year old and stfu complaining. Y'all complained all last year about them bringing it back and not making new LTMs to play instead. And downvoted the trailer to oblivion had content creators bash the LTM etc. And now they give us a new LTM and just because y'all don't like it all of a sudden you wanna complain they didn't bring back Winterfest Express instead? It's dumb stop being spoiled brats and deal with the consequences of the communities action. Congrats y'all banded together and got respawn to give us new content if you aren't happy with the new LTM that's your right and it's ok. But stop acting so surprised we didn't get Winter Express. To anyone who didn't complain about Winterfest I'm sorry a majority of the fanbased ruined it for us, but everyone else can enjoy their clown make up.

Edit: Just to clarify Im not talking about EVERYONE who is upset Winter Express is gone. Nor am I saying I dislike the fact that  people complain about Apex. Complaints are usually warranted and people should feel how they feel. I'm only talking about the people who took time out of their day last year to downvote the trailer and express their distaste for the winter express returning every year last year and then are now all of a sudden upset respawn took in that feedback and removed the mode. Complaints are very ok and should be voiced by the community but they should also be consistent especially when it's likely to be taken in as Feedback by the devs. ",apexlegends,1702396213.0,t3_18goy31

Respawn please just remove Lifeline at this point,"As a season 0 player and who mained lifeline until it literally hurt my team by using her, it's beyond frustrating to see a legend come out with ideas pitched by this community to buff her. 

There will be zero reason to use lifeline at the start of next season, you could honestly load into the game as a toilet and probably be more effective at being a medic than the ACTUAL FUCKING MEDIC. 

Refund people their skins they bought and just call it a day on Lifeline respawn. You completely destroyed the legend and unless an entire rework is done to her(already said it won't happen), there is zero point to having her in this game.

Edit: I have empty boxes to sell for $500 for all of you who think Lifeline is in a good place, sadly looks like I'm gonna do well looking at some of these responses.

Stop bitching about SBMM,"EDIT:
*Before you read the rest, I absolutely understand that it's being implemented poorly by the devs. Y'all are right in that sense, and I agree with the push-back for *that* reason. This post is more for those that dislike SBMM on principle.*


It's insanely hypocritical.

Everyone here seems to think that:

A) ""The Top 10%"" of players *deserve* a completely random lobby, so that they can feel good about themselves for shitting on n00bs,

AND

B) They believe that they are somehow an accurate representation of that ""Top 10%"".

The justification for saying that SBMM is detrimental goes like this: 

""I *did* my time, at one point I *was* bad at the game. Now, in the name of having a relaxing time, it is *my right* to play against people who are less skilled than me. I want a chance to feel the strength of my new skills against the average player.""

This is utter hypocrisy.

Players pushing back on SBMM are ravenous for a chance to degrade another player's enjoyment, so that they can feel more powerful.

With *no* SBMM, players with less time to devote to playing Apex would *always* have a lobby that is more difficult to relax in than even a so-called ""sweaty lobby"" of a higher skill player with SBMM turned *on*. 

Why do more skilled players deserve a chance to unwind, but not lower skilled? All you whiny golds and plats, imagine if, outside of ranked, you were permanently forced into all-predator lobbies. Just so that those predator players could get their ""hard-earned"" sense of righteous superiority.

More troubling, though, is what the dislike of SBMM implies: that players would rather win several unbalanced games than win a scarce amount of difficult, fair games. 

This shows massive laziness, and a lack of competitive spirit. Any true competitor would derive no satisfaction from overcoming an obstacle that they were rigged to defeat anyway.",apexlegends,1578445361.0,t3_ell1b1

Discrimination of players that don't have squad for ranked and they get most of the time a premade duo to play with...,"Hello everyone, I play apex for a few seasons now and I preffer to play ranked. 90% of the time I play solo, without a premade squad. When playing, 9/10 times I'm queued up with two premade guys (they have the same tag) and then the problems start. They act like you don't even exist. If 2 guys are down, the 3rd one will never help you first despite the fact that you are in a better spot. You have to follow them when they don't even tell you where are we going, are we pushing or backing down.  I have a feeling that matches with 3 random guys have higher winrate then squads with 2 premades and 1 random guy. Has anyone expirienced this situation? Do you have any advice on how to improve this type of situations? Sometimes I just pick a place and jump solo and hustle my way 1v3 with Caustic. (Sadge)",apexlegends,1694001945.0,t3_16bih2v

"if you don't use your mic, don't queue for ranked.","There is no valid counter argument.   

Just because Apex has a ""ping system"" doesn't mean you're doing the community any favor by queuing for ranked and then not communicating with your teammates. It's incredible how a lack of microphone usage is considered the norm for sweaty people grinding through plat/diamond. It's the only bad thing about the apex community. You see so much more mic usage and understanding that there's a team in the CSGO/Valorant communities, and it's a shame. So very annoying that respawn even added a feature where you can turn off comms, they've helped contribute to the problem, and it was a huge step in the wrong direction. Ranked mode should require a microphone test before each game you join. If you don't want to communicate, then play unranked. If you argue that you can communicate by some random pings or tying, you're wrong and part of the problem.  Stop ruining the game for those that enjoy grinding ranked. Apex is a team based game, participate with a team or solo queue in unranked.

"A lot of high end console players hate .6 aim assist too, it's NOT just pc players!","There is no reason for .6 to exist. People who cry about possible nerf are not realizing that it is not ok to consistently beam for hundreds damage without even trying. 0.4 aim assist is MORE than enough. If you're not able to hit anybody without .6 that's literally a you probably, like you're just garbage and actually need to learn how to aim/change your settings. I literally had to switch over to PC just cuz it's getting sickening from being killed by lvl 50 just cuz of 0.6, while I'm strafing/move around. This shit is ain't ok in any way of form. I've knew many console players that ran either no aim assist or .4, all of em are able to beam JUST FINE.  Aim assist nerf is needed so console ACTUALLY will begin to have AT LEAST some sort of skill gap, because for now it's just about who one clips another one first. No. Fun.
To add: have you seen like an average mnk player ever to be able to beam for 150-200? I've never, unless it was pro/master/pred/etc. But when it comes to console, everybody able to hit at least 150 from hipfire. It takes no effort, no skill.",apexlegends,1641765896.0,t3_s02wxr

Hot Take: Storm Point is the best map in Apex Legends,"I've been playing Apex a lot this season (and have been in previous seasons) and find myself wanting Storm Point to be back in the game a lot. This isn't just because it was gone, as it was my favorite map before it left. Here's why I think, contrary to popular opinion, Storm Point is the best map in the game for Ranked AND Pubs.

1. No Fragment-Type POI: Teams on Storm Point choose multiples places to land. You can land contested with multiple other teams at places like Cascade Falls if you so choose for early game action. However, the pacing of Storm Point ensures that you're not looking at 5 squads in Ring 2.
2. Lack of Third Parties: Of all three maps, Storm Point has the fairest fights.
3. Loot Everywhere: On some maps, I find there are many places where you can't find a lot of loot, particularly shield batteries. Storm Point is big enough where you can choose how often you loot and fight. And to address people's complaints about not being able to find people: there are many places that multiple teams rotate through, often. Crafting in cascade falls, killing prowlers in Jurrasic Park, or heading toward any armory virtually guarantees you'll find a fight. 
4. Mobility: Between tridents and grav cannons, you will always have a way into zone in the earlier zones.
5. Great endgames: I find Storm Point's endgames superior to the endgames of all other maps. Terrain is so varied that positioning is rewarded, and no two battles are the same. The buildings on Storm Point are also very interesting to play around (the 2-story green ones, mostly)

There's probably more things I'm forgetting, but unlike the average person (or what might turn out to be a vocal minority), I think Storm Point is the best designed map of all of them and can't wait until it returns.",apexlegends,1675033549.0,t3_10ollzw

Lobby => dying in 3 minutes => repeat. No I am not crying about how bad I am. I know I'm not the best player, and I'm fine with that.

"Unless you are a programmer, hardware engineer, or another industry professional, stop ripping the devs for not fixing the game.","There is nothing more frustrating for me as a player (and I’m sure as a Respawn dev) than to see all the posts about “fixing the game”. I’m a Computer Science student, and I know it doesn’t take studying this stuff to understand the levels of complexity in fixing the problems with this game, and any game for that matter.

1) Crashes: these crashes are a nightmare for developers to need to fix. You need to run hundreds and thousands of test environments, either virtually or with different physical hardware setups, to trace the issues that players experience. If they were in a different industry, say grocery stores, hardware crashes are much easier to fix because they’re hardware and software is very similar across the board. When you have 50 million players running many different rigs, it’ll take time to trace every problem. Once they find the problem, they need to find ways to fix it THAT WONT MAKE OTHER PEOPLE CRASH. I know, this issue is super frustrating from a players perspective, but they’ve already said they have been working on it dilligently and will until it’s fixed.

2) Bugs: When you hear the word “bug”, some think it’s as easy as going right to where you THINK the problem is, changing a few lines of code, and fixing it. Believe me, if it was that easy this major would be a joke. There’s a common practice in Computer Science called Rubber Duck Debugging. I kid you not, programmers have rubber ducks at their desks that they talk out loud to in order to help them find the bugs, because 99% of the time it’s a completely different thing in a completely different piece of code. Once they find the problem, you have to “fix” it, run tests to see if it causes immediate problems, and then play the game. This can be especially tricky because MEMORY IS A PAIN IN THE ASS. The way your computer “reads and processes” what is in your fancy memory can be different between each Operating System and the build/patch for the given Operating System (and hardware) you are using. This testing takes a while just like the hard crashes you’re experiencing. Again, they have voiced that they’re working on everything as soon as it pops up.

3) Hacking: Yes, it is unfun to play against hackers. There are appropriate ways to report them and they’ve shown that they’re pretty on top of stopping them as they can. There are only two ways to nearly end hacking for good, neither of which I’m guessing you want. Option one is to make the game pay to play, which will deter hackers from buying many accounts. Option two is to make an EXTREMELY intrusive anticheat that would monitor your computer from the second it boots up til the second it turns off. Nobody wants that kind of invasion. HWID bans are starting to go out and that’s great, but in a free to play game, expect some hackers until there’s some sort of Prime system like CSGO has. If you are a new player reading this, I promise the hacking issue is not NEARLY as bad as this sub makes it out to be.

I just want players to be educated and realize that these aren’t instant fixes even with a massive company like Respawn. The game came out a month ago and this sub often makes it sound like the game is completely dead because of the problems that are being resolved. Thank you Respawn for working to patch up the problems and for making a great game.

Today was just disappointing.,"I woke up expecting a decent patch but all we got was an event. Sure, an event might be cool, but for those that weren't interested in the first place, or already got bored of it, the game is the same as ever. As if nothing has changed at all.

Charge Rifle is still OP. I don't know how they couldn't nerf it for this patch. Literally not changed at all.

Training is still the same. The new firing range they showed a few days ago seemed pretty final and functional. Even then, it must be piss easy for Respawn to add attachments to the training area. This is either incompetence or laziness. 

They add a new event which is not really well balanced, and can only be played solo, leading people to team up once again. What's the point of not adding more options for different sized parties at this point? The game has a massive playerbase. Does Respawn really think they'd dilute the playerbase that much by just adding solos/duos/trios, or **at the very least** no-fill? I don't understand. In the end, they're only creating problems for the game that could easily be fixed by adding more than just one way of playing a gamemode.

Muzzle flash not changed at all despite the map being nightmode. Seriously, can anyone see? Visibility is tough enough with the map being dark. We don't need more unnecessary clutter preventing us from seeing. Muzzle flash should've been reduced across the board a long time ago. In fact, it looked pretty cool in the trailer.

This looked pretty good and non-obtrusive. Why can't be the game be like this? I swear the game becomes so much more enjoyable when I can actually see people while shooting.

And obviously, because there was no patch today, we didn't get any of the features that are stated as ""Coming in future patch"" in their trello.

I guess now we just wait 2 more weeks until we can get balance changes and whatnot.",apexlegends,1571183949.0,t3_digv4c

Solo players: Feel like the ranked grind is slow/hard in Seasons 15/16? This is why,"Respawn began using the quality of your teammates to manage your win rate so that you play as much as possible. They can't have you grinding from gold to diamond in a week when they can squeeze 3 weeks of engagement out of you. That's why you're paired with wood-tier teammates. It's not skill-based matchmaking, well, it is, it's just that it's being used *against* you. Because that's what makes you stay more engaged longer and there's that ever-important metric of dollars per engagement hour. Remember, respawn is your antagonist and they don't give a fuck about you or how much fun you have as long as you stay hooked and pay up. You're nothing to them. Hell, they measure you by the thousands; not as individuals.

Fuck a Bar that drains like Valkyrie's passive, just take it out the game completely, rework the Legend completely honestly. Having to use zero game sense is bonkers. His ultimate, nerf it to hell. It also eliminates having any game sense too. It's too damn large, there's no counter. Just rework him. Honestly wouldn't mind if they just made Seer a different class Legend all together.

I can't seem to make a move in Hardcore Royal without Seer's team knowing exactly where I am or my team. And hearing his passive just makes me want to quit even trying to push and just leave the situation. It really feels like cheating.

This event is the worst event I've seen in a game.,"Look, I was hoping to have fun in this event. The last event at least gave us an awesome new drop location.

The drop location for this event is horrendous. A few guns, sparsely scattered so you either get to shoot unarmed enemies, or die unarmed. Not very fun either way.

The game type is terrible. Dropping and having to check 5 times as many locations as normal to find a gun magnifies one of the most frustrating parts of battle Royale games: dying without a gun. 

For context, fortnite fixed the dying without a gun early in the game by making each chest have a guaranteed gun. 

Apex's new  ""Armed and Dangerous"" game type ironically makes it very easy to die unarmed and defenseless, or kill people holding nothing, which is not very satisfying.

Apex devs are allowing this game to die.,"Okay, I cannot describe how tilting this game is getting with each season. There are several problems I want to point out and get over with.

1. 20 tick servers, seriously in 2023?

I cannot explain how many times I have died behind a wall. I play on 3-4 ms ping (fiber) and ow boiiiiii how many hours beforehand do I have to get behind a door to not get shot. Lag compensation in combination with 20 tick servers makes me want to pull my hair out. People with bad connections are basically being rewarded. No regging is also a horendous thing to experience LITERALLY EVERY FIGHT. No, it is not my PC, I have a high-end pc with fiber internet, it is 100% the servers. Do not get me started about constant game stutters.

2. Aim assist, yes I am going there. 

I get it, controller requires AA, it is fine I understand. However, 0 ms rotational AA, basically inhuman, how do you want me to be fine with that? Adjust to normal values, figure something out. Furthermore, AA still works through visual clutter.... yes make it make sense. This should not be the case. AA needs to be tuned drastically, people should not feel the need to switch to controller just to get the edge over someone else. The large influx of controller players in competitive, ranked or even pubs is a clear indication that something needs to be adjusted. I do not care about console AA, keep it the same. The problem starts with people buying a PC and then attaching a controller, just adjust PC AA values or just give them a different lobby, I do not care anymore at this point just get it done.

3. CFG, steam setup for spamming movement tech, macros, walling, cheating or whatever you can come up with that is an external influence to get an edge over other people.

Anything you tweak OUTSIDE THE GAME SETTINGS IS CHEATING. How pathethic and bad must you be to resort to something so insulting. Please, I know this is the only satisfaction you get, but you are not good, you are just coping by using cheats. Especially, observing this in competitive is really pathethic. This needs to be solved.

These are the three big points not necessarily related to in-game complaints.

In-game complaints:

Ow boi where to begin to the endless list. I will keep it short.

Gun meta

1. most weapons are balanced, but these need to be nerfed: hemlok and 30-30. Nemesis is ehhh... 

2.Buff: r301, they nerfed this weapon to give the nemesis more space, but damn this weapon is bad.

3. AR hipfire nerf was a bad choice. Yes I know the hipfire was too good before and you just needed a long range weapon and shotty. Now its just smgs all over and considering AA exists, it is just a horrible experience. Just buff AR hipfire a little bit.

4. Shotguns are just horrible to use, like damn. 11 pumping someone who is 0.5m away from me and not hitting? Mate, do not get me started. I do not know what the problem exactly is, but a tighter spread or pellet size increase should get the job done.

5. Wingman sniper ammo. I know, the wingman was too oppressive with heavy ammo since you could spam it constantly. However, mate, do you know how stupid it is to keep looking for sniper ammo constantly and not being to find/loot any, because NO ONE RUNS SNIPERS. Make wingman heavy again and make it use two bullets per shot, instead of one.

6. Charge rifle too awkward too use. Firing rate/speed does not make sense with the charge up time.

Legends

1. I am fine with most legends at the moment. Several could use a small buff/nerf, but overall it is fine, except for conduit. Conduits ult is a big problem, it is almost impossible to see or hear, I have died so many times, before I know I was getting hit and stun by it. Also having to do at least 200 dmg per barrel to destroy it? Damn, I have no words.

2. Mirage, fix the damn decoys. Bloody hell, they DIE ON EVERY SMALL ROCK OR WHATEVER. Yes, I am a mirage main sometimes.

There is many more things about the legends, but as I said there is just too much to say.

Ranked

1. Go back to season 13 ranked system with the better aspects of season 11 and other good seasons.

2. MMR, mate, I am trying to rank up. Why am I going against preds and masters while being in gold/plat. I am high diamond rank, but while im trying to rank up to diamond I should not see these high elo players until I get to diamond. Do you know how unnecessarily long this journey becomes, just because I have to fight preds and masters players?

3. The challenges to rank up. They are fine, only complaint is getting a braindead random teammate for three games back to back while only having 5 tries and dying constantly. Yes this happened, yes I turned off the game afterwards.

4. Broken moon is ass for ranked, change my mind.

Gameplay

1. So bland, nothing new. Just new skins, boooringggg.

2. FIX AUDIOOOOOO. IT HAS BEEN I DONT KNOW HOW MANY SEASONS AND I STILL GET DROPPED ON BY A FULL TEAM WITHOUT ANY SIGN AND JUST INSTA DYING. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

That is it, my biggest complaints. At the end of the day I feel that fixing the server issues would get this game far, just by itself. Fine tuning AA, gun meta, legend meta and in-game play is the next thing. Yes in that order, AA is just too oppressive and needs to get adjusted. ONLY FOR PC, CONSOLE CAN KEEP THEIR AA. The other points can be adjusted later.

I may be downvoted to hell but...,"Stop complaining about paid skins in a free to play game. Yes it may be overpriced, yes you may not thing it’s worth what it’s priced at. BUT, this game is free to play. Without people buying these skins this game wouldn’t exist/be supported by EA. They need these to keep the game going.

RIP Apex Legends?,I’m simply posting this as a historical marker for the game apex legends. As a day one player (week one badge my favorite achievement). I see Apex Legends coming to a crossroads in its existence with this most recent ranked change but more importantly with the inner workings of Respawn and it’s relationship to EA. The games direction has started to shift and it seems the same creativity that brought forth a project as ambitious as Apex Legends is being stifled. The game needs to keep pushing the boundaries of gaming to set the standard for what is to come in the future. The recent changes lead me to believe respawn has begun to coast and as a player I feel the game will lose its relevance once the only reason players come back to the game is to check out the new micro transactions rather than for a fun playing experience.

"Seer is lazy, degenerate, and creatively bankrupt. And here's why","Seer is the most disappointing legend to date. Adding legends that cannabalize existing legends, crypto and bloodhound in this instance, feels so creatively bankrupt. Adding a passive that gives you game sense to enemy location feels like mocking everybody who has their match ruined by audio bugs. His new passive is mostly good because of how vague directional audio is, and sometimes even non existent when it bugs out. 75 whole meters of getting a visual and audio indicator of where people are while ADSing. 

And then the fact that they had to nerf bloodhounds scan length just to give a reason for Seer to exist,  feels like another cheap shot. His tactical will make 3rd partying even more powerful, and hence more encouraged, is just making the game more degenerate too.

What makes this game special to me is movement. It drives you to think on your feet, make guesses at where people are going to be and how fast you can get to a spot to counter it, it makes for such an enjoyable skill ceiling to this game. Adding a character that contributes nothing to that, and only detracts from existing support characters, feels like a wasted opportunity.

This upcoming Valkyrie change SUCKS and makes me worried for the future of Apex,"For anyone who doesn't know, Valkyrie's hover mode when she holds her tactical is being completely removed, not nerfed or adjusted, removed entirely. The reason the devs gave was specifically related to the ALG.

Now when Valkyrie first launched and people found out about hover mode the devs said here in this subreddit that it was intentional, balanced and wouldn't be removed, but now that some kind of pro play has been introduced, they're going back on that and removing it entirely.

This is the problem, balancing a game played mostly casually around pro play. Overwatch did this and all it did was create a disconnect between the average player and the devs and made them resent pro players.

Aside from the fact that Valkyrie's hover mode just straight up isn't overpowered, the game should NEVER be balanced around a pro league, the two are fundamentally different and play in completely different ways, you can't apply balance to both it just doesn't work out.

Respawn, if you're going to make balance changes for the ALG, make them ALG only, don't force them on the rest of the playerbase, because the vast majority of players don't care about Valkyrie's hover mode, it shouldn't be removed from the game just because of pros.",apexlegends,1622104946.0,t3_nm30pc

Reasons why this game is slowly losing player base as days go by.,"1. No content to make this game an better game. Content such as game modes like solos, duos, or 4 man squads, or anything else fun-like. 
2. Playing with randoms constantly that doesn't know how to play or is their first time playing an FPS game. 
3. There is at LEAST 1 or 2 cheaters in every game. Though they tend to die in early game most of the time. 
4. Unfair matchmaking against pre-mades when you're just playing solo squads. 

&#x200B;

Please add more content into this game so it can be so much more fun. Rather than just having to deal with randoms and pre-mades that will just screw you over in most of your games. Especially cheaters, most of them are Chinese. :(",apexlegends,1555423329.0,t3_bduaun

Pre-made squads should have their own pub matchmaking and should not be put in lobbies with solo queuing players. Agree/ disagree?,"The Apex pub experience for solo queue players is poor at best. One way I think it could be imporved would be to have solo queuers only play other solos, and have premade squads face other premades. I would happily sit in a queue for a longer time if I'm in a 'solo only' lobby. 

I understand people want to play with club friends, but it's massively unbalanced to have people teaming vs solo queuers. Hardcore players will usually queue together so it would make sense to have them play each other.

Why is Pathfinder so popular?,"Now I am a bit of a new player, and I do know that Path has been around since the start of the game, but I just don't get it. 

The dude's hitbox is massive, firstly.

His passive is essentially non existent.

His Ultimate is incredibly subpar and while it can serve use it could also make you an easier target (especially with a larger hitbox)

The tactical, while it can be really effective, is a little tricky to even remotely optimise with players trying out the character. I feel like the only reason people have gotten so far with his grapple to the extent that he is still relevant is because people have had so much time to play with him. 

If you're in a close-quarters but outdoor fight, and you're a bit of a new player and so you decide to just gain some high ground or grapple to a better spot. You do it. Done. Now what?

It's not like it's an ability that you can use immediately with great effect. Path seems to be (for me) a character with an inherent disadvantage compared to practically every other legend in the game. In terms of fun, there isn't really much either (although this is subjective). 

Nothing cool like gas, decoys, miniguns, ferrofluid walls, just a fat hitbox (without fortified) and a mini spiderman ability that if you grinded the character for hundreds  of hours you could get really good at doing.

No disrespect for path mains, I just have never seen the appeal of pathfinder and I doubt I ever will. For me, he is outranked on fundamentally every level as a legend design. If he was released today, he'd be very unpopular, at least right after the high of people trying out a new character.",apexlegends,1674390353.0,t3_10iijtt

Suggestion: The game would be better if Horizon was retired,"She's incredibly fun to play, this isn't meant as a knock to her but I think the best thing Apex could do is retire Horizon from the game but not her abilities.

The best part of Apex has always been it's movement mechanics but since release we've seen numerous nerfs with changes to bhopping, tap strafing, etc. Horizon is so much fun to play because of her better movement capabilities so I think they should apply to all legends. Give everyone better air strafing and the ability to land and glide which will improve the fun of fights.

Her tactical comes back as a survival item. There's plenty of situations where you need to move up vertically but the balloon just doesn't make sense or work. Teams being able to throw down a gravity lift would add new elements to game play.

Her ultimate comes back as a new form of grenade in a smaller form. This adds a new element to fights as well being able to throw gravity nades into the mix to affect the fight.

TL;DR: She retires from the games but her abilities all get spread out and stay in the game. Every legend gets more fun movement mechanics and makes the game itself better.",apexlegends,1704482780.0,t3_18zf62l

Hot Take: Valkyrie is perfectly balanced,"I seen discussions of people talking about Valk possibly getting a nerf, and I feel like given her kit, she’s actually in a great spot. I probably run her a fraction of the time, but I don’t ever have any issues with the Legend, regardless if it’s Pubs or high-end Ranked matches. I think people get it twisted when a Legend is good, they automatically say they’re too strong. I think the better conversation is we need to focus on legends who need buffs. 

Valk’s ultimate, the ability to reposition, already has a pretty good delay before lift-off. I constantly cancel out Valk’s who are trying to ult away, and I can’t tell you how many people I’ve knocked who already launched off. When you do launch off, people can see and hear you coming. It’s an amazing ability for ranked but it isn’t broken imo. Basically her ultimate is a portable jump tower, with delays. Do I think it’s the best ultimate? Debatable, but there are some other really amazing ultimates.

Her tactical, I seen people complain about the stunned ability when hit, which lasts all of 3 seconds. By the time the Valk hits you with it and then pushes you’re already out of the stunned state, it don’t even do a lot of damage, and the missiles are slightly delayed and notify the enemy before they’re even launched. Her passive I think is what makes people mad because she can fly away to higher ground. Counter? Pathfinder. Horizon. Octane. Ash. Revenant. Another Valk. I can’t tell you how many Valk’s I shoot down because they’re holding in the jet pack which makes them a piñata/sitting duck. 

I guess you could consider this a hot take to some, but all of her abilities have some type of counter/delay. She can also scan beacons but so can every other Recon Legend. I feel like she’s similar to Bangalore in the fact that both of them feel really balanced to me. Is Valk good? Hell yeah, one of the better legends. Is she broken? Hell no. Again, we need to stop getting it twisted that great legends are busted. It’s time to buff some other legends.",apexlegends,1650048823.0,t3_u4f0pi

"Bloodhound’s tactical ruins one of the most fundamental aspects of battle royales, and it’s slowly killing this game for me.","I’ll start out by saying that I’ve been playing this game since about 2-3 days after launch. I love it. It’s been my favorite battle royale that’s come out, and I’ve tried most of them. There are very few games- of any type- that have managed to hold my interest for this long. So as I type this out, just know that I’m pretty invested, and I’m not just talking out of frustration after a bad match. This has been slowly wearing on me over a long period of time.

I don’t keep up with the general Apex community very often, so I don’t know if what I’m about to say is a controversial opinion or if others are on my side here, but either way, I’m putting it out there. 

&nbsp;

Ever since PUBG thrust the battle royale genre of video games into the limelight, one of the most fun and interesting aspects of the genre, at least for me, has been the potential for using strategic positioning to ambush foes, or to gain an upper hand in a fight, or to strategically avoid a fight, or to hide and recover, or even just to get away altogether. I always thought that the ability to go into any building you see, and into every room in that building, made for some great tactical gameplay, where being smart and patient would pay off. 

&nbsp;

So, enter Bloodhound. I really like this character for the most part. His passive is one of the coolest in the game, and his general vibe is interesting. Some mysterious tracker that slowly hunts down his enemies by following their footsteps is a great concept.

&nbsp;

But that damn tactical ability. With one button press, available every 15 seconds (or less, with a gold helmet), he completely dismantles all the strategic planning and careful gameplay that could otherwise make for an interesting and rewarding experience in a match. His Eye of the Allfather covers an insane amount of ground, oftentimes completely sweeping an entire area on the map.

Did you and your teammates talk for several minutes to strategically position yourself in this building, setting up traps and finding the best corners to hide in? Oh well. Eye of the Allfather. Did you manage to get out of a fight through skillful maneuvering around tight corners and find a good spot to heal up? That sucks. Eye of the Allfather. Is this your fourth match in a row where you’ve been thrown into a match alone despite having the “Fill Teammates” box checked, so you’re trying to lay low and sneak past a populated area? How cute. Eye of the Allfather. 

&nbsp;

The ease and frequency at which this ability just completely undermines any strategic thinking and skillful prowess that a talented player would find rewarding, that would encourage smart and careful play patterns, is disheartening, and frankly, insulting. Again, by pressing *a single button,* something a toddler could do, this character fully dismantles all the effort one puts into intelligent decision-making in a fraction of a second. That type of strategizing is what appeals to me about these types of games, because you can’t get that in your typical FPS, or in most games of other genres. So having it laughed away by such an effortless action is frustrating, to say the least. I just don’t believe he adds anything of value to the game, aside from a cheap and easy way to gain an advantage over players that have put far more effort into their gameplay.

&nbsp;

So, thoughts? I’m sure at least a fair margin of people will disagree with me, as he’s clearly a very popular character choice. But am I in the minority here? I hope not. Feel free to chime in with whatever viewpoint you have.",apexlegends,1619832429.0,t3_n2876r
Could we try to treat the game developers with a little compassion?,"This seems to have gotten way out hand in this community and it makes me really sad.

I think it is good for the community to raise concerns when something problematic occurs, but guys! They get it already! No amount of complaining is going to change their next course of action. If the changes they make in the next week are still problematic, then you can bring it to their attention again, but this is just rude.

Yes, the battle pass should have been tested more, but I’m sure that their cosmetic progression was no where’s near as important as testing the new map, new legend, meta changes, new vehicles, and more other actually important in-game mechanics.

Finally Quitting,"Don’t get me wrong, I loved the progress and updates this game has made since day 1. However, the matchmaking has gone to absolute shit. 
If I had to choose a moment where I really felt the effects of being paired with multiple 60k+ kill predators, it would be the introduction of cross play. I wouldn’t mind the cross play if I was still being paired properly, but it’s just made the competition much more difficult. You may be asking, “Why not just turn off cross play?” I’m playing on PS4, and when I turn it off it never actually finds enough people to even make one game. 
The store used to be simple and rotated properly, but most of the time it’s only 20$-99$ skin packs and nothing else.

I talk, and instantly get called an f slur, get made fun of, the most vulgar things you can think of.

 It happens constantly. I do have a pretty feminine sounding voice, which i guess just causes people to hate on me? Im usually pretty friendly to everyone unless they start with me first. My boyfriend has even come on the mic and defended me a few times lol. It’s just so disheartening because I just wanna play the game without people caring if im gay or about my voice, and comms have been increasingly important due to the sweaty nature of pubs and ranked.

If the devs give a good season with no content fans are mad because there's no new content

If they give a low tire legend everyone complain that ""I rather have a op legend that is nerfed to the group in one season rather than a ass legend""

If the legend is op everyone is mad because it's changing the Meta

Even this season fans are mad. Good server, legend, weapon and map so what's the reason they are mad?? Because of the animation

F*** of ""fan""

Seriously why the fans are never happy??

I played rainbow six for three years and I can tell you respawn devs are one of the best
They don't add a broken weapon that makes the game unplayable (I'm not hinting at you cod)

People don't realize that respawn is not a big group

They made Titanfall 1&2 , starwars fallen order and apex

Uninstalled the game,"Picked apex legends up around 5 months ago and played it a lot, had a lot of great moments, was able to solo Q to diamond which felt like an achievement.

But I am done with the game.

The server issues recently are just so bad... I feel disrespected as a part of the apex community by a company that has made so much money on this game alone.

There are other reasons I could have given up on the game, like the matchmaking putting me in matches with people well below my skill level consistently (enemies and allies), the general hell that Solo Q'ing can be, the character balance still being bad or the time commitment needed to keep your edge and keep improving in this game...

but in the end it's server issues. I have seen better servers in dodgy asian games designed to milk their player base for every cent with straight-up gambling mechanics tied to progression.

- The servers

"My idea for Revenant Totem re-work: Instead of Death Protection, Shadow Form","Revenant's ultimate sucks. It's been nerfed to a state where it's not op with Octane's jump pad, but the end result is that on its own the Totem is really quite bad. So, this is my suggestion for a re-work of his ultimate:

Keep the Totem, but when a player activates it, they don't get Death Protection, instead they get the Shadow Form movement buffs (as in the Shadow Royale Halloween event) for 30 seconds: ability to wall-run, double-jump, Revenant-climb, 30% faster movement speed. And they can use weapons and to be clear: the Totem would have no effect on their health, they'd still have the same shields + health and can heal. If you get knocked, you get knocked, no sending back to the Totem.

Also from the devs' stand point, this shouldn't be a ton of work, because the Totem remains and Shadow Form already exists, too.

SBMM is good. Change my mind.,"Edit: I concede that SBMM sucks for high tier players, and that it need improvements. I remain convinced that SBMM overall is beneficial for the player base. Thanks for the discussion on a slow day at work!

I see complaints about SBMM daily on this sub.  And I think I could summarize them all pretty generally. “I used to be able to win most of my games, and now I can’t. And the game isn’t fun for me as a result. Please let me win all the time again.”

Most of the posts are from high performing players. KDA over 2 (most over 5 from my browsing).  Level 100 or above. Many many hours invested. 

Reality check-

There are thousands of players that are not good at this game. I am one of them. For every game with 7 or 8 kills, I’d have dozens where I would die with no kills. To other players riding the level 100 cap before it was extended. I don’t think I’ve hit level 40 yet. 

Now that the 1% are playing together more, the remaining 99% has less of a skill gap to clear to have a chance to win. 

Honestly, I bet the majority of Apex revenue comes from battlepasses and unlocks. I would imagine Apex cares much more about maintaining the thousands of players near or below a KDA of 1 to maintain the BP revenue than losing a few hundred maybe but not likely whales that spend hundreds of hours playing and might spend $250 getting boxing gloves for pathfinder. 

To the loud minority complaining about SBMM: Are you really good at this game? What’s your KDA? If you are upset at getting destroyed by better players, why should the majority of Apex newbies be exposed to lose to you? How does that help the ecosystem?",apexlegends,1576786592.0,t3_ecyq0p
This Game Sucks Now,"When I first started playing Apex I immediately fell in love and it was the only thing I would play day in and day out. I played through the wingman/PK meta, No audio glitch, the broken pathfinder hitbox, Spitfire Meta, Longbow meta, and the stupid disruptor rounds. I even grind’d to apex predator in season 2 in under 2 weeks because I was so hyped for an actual rank system. However, as of the release of S3 there still remains horrible footstep audio (it honestly can’t be that hard to increase footstep audio, it’s been 3 seasons), lack of things to grind for (badges etc.). Also this new map is probably the biggest factor that’s pushing me away from apex at the moment. The map forces a more passive play style and punishes an aggressive play style as there are multiple Lines of sights and once you are caught in the open you just get beamed by 5 fucking charge rifles 400m out (That “nerf” was utter bullshit btw, all they did was remove one shot. The magazine size wasn’t the problem at all). Ranked isn’t even fun anymore, it’s too easy to get to Apex Predator and there is always a crutch weapon and they still reward placement way to highly. If someone is able to drop 10+ kills in ranked they should be rewarded, someone that camps to top 2 with 0 kills shouldn’t be rewarded more points than someone who gets 5+ kills and dies before top 10. I almost forgot to mention, the no registration hits on players is also another problem with this season. At this point I don’t even know what I’m complaining about.
-Charge rifle needs a DAMAGE reduction
-Ranked shouldn’t reward bad players
-Footstep audio needs to increased 
-Fix the no registration shots
-Add King’s Canyon to the rotation
-Add badges or something to grind for PLZ
-Gibby has too much health (nerf gun shield health)
-Wraiths phase ability takes too long to activate
-Mirage should be able to cancel his ultimate at anytime 
- character select screen should be a Free for all not an ordered pick
    .If not, matching with people who have the same character selected should be decreased somehow.
-Spawn rate of Mozambique and P2020 are way too high and dilute the loot pool
- More permanent game modes would be nice.... SOLOs or maybe quads or even duos
-More non energy weapons would be nice

IDEK this game had/still has a lot of potential but they seriously need to fix something’s because at this rate I don’t know how long this game will last, the player base since launch has already decreased so much and it hasn’t even been a year.

Make Bleed Out a permanent feature,"Now that bleed out is in the LTM mode I hope that they'll add it to the default game.

 We've all had situations where only one teammate is standing against a full stack and the only path to survival is abandoning their teammates. When downed you have little agency. You can inch your way towards an enemy in hopes they'll finish you so that maybe your teammate can swoop you. Otherwise you're just forced to wait and your teammate has to hide and wait or flee altogether. 

It's especially egregious when you're escaping the ring with no heals. Waiting for your teammates to bleed out is rarely viable. So they have to sit and wait to die, with no other choice to make, then spectate the rest of the match.

Inb4 ""it will be abused"": how? If someone wants to leave they'll just quit. If they're trying to avoid ranked penalties their banner can still be grabbed. If they really want to remain dead there's currently nothing stopping them from splitting off and committing suicide. 

Having the option to bleed out improves the game and gives us more choice in how we survive.",apexlegends,1700110021.0,t3_17wed0v

There is no justification for how bad the matchmaking is.,"Pubs matchmaking has been bad for a long time, but it's just getting worse and worse as time goes on and it continues to be put on the back burner. Hell, it's still in the freezer.

I could go on and on about my lifetime stats vs my stats this season, but that's besides the point. Stats aren't everything of course, and the sample size isn't that big so it could just be a run of bad luck. But the death recap screens of my stats vs the enemy stats are so pathetic it's almost funny at this point. Almost. Not quite.

2 things the developers need to realize.

1) the people complaining about matchmaking do not care that they are losing. They care about HOW they are losing. We're fine with the 1/20 and 1.0kd averages. But when those 19 losses are to 3 stack level 10,000 elite dick stompers with 50,000 horizon kills, it tends to get exhausting. 

2) Casual pubs players are the majority of your player base. Changing up ranked every season is fine, but turning a blind eye to your main player base will not work out for you in the long run.  Those elite dick stompers need people to farm kills off after all.",apexlegends,1692236487.0,t3_15t90vn

Apex makes me sad.,"I am a day 1 player. Played for multiple seasons. I have wraith, octane, pathfinder, rampart, and valkyrie's heirlooms. I've put countless hours into gameplay and quite a chunk of money (more than I'd like to admit).

I'll always appreciate apex for the past it granted me. However valkyries heirloom, (even ramparts) i started to realize that EA was taking over and all they cared about was money. Now that i look at it as an adult/parent i regret every purchase i ever made with apex and wish i could take it back. If i could take every dollar, n reinvest it into my son i would. I strongly suggest to any other players new or old, do not put any money into this game. It is not worth it. They do not care about you..all they want is money. I don't give a rats a** if i get hate for this opinion. I just want to let people know, and give them the opportunity to decide if its worth putting money into or not.

If you feel personally attacked by the devs comments then you are what they said you are,"What seems like personal and unprofessional comments from devs were nothing ,but the devs trying to defend themselves as honestly as they can and it's no wonder you feel personally attacked. You never expected this type of response from devs. Hell nobody in the community expects devs actually firing back calling their toxic fan base what they actually are.

Admit it you were expecting a Todd Howard type of PR bullshit excuse even though you actually weren't going to believe it you were expecting it. I saw many posts here expecting that kind of PR crap.

Is the iron crowd event expensive? Yes. Is the amount of toxicity behind it justified? Actually no. There was a way to have more civil discussions and respectful conversation about this. But the response the devs got was just whining upon whining(this subreddit only knows how to whine) so the way devs responded to you is an answer to how you responded to them.

[I mean please tell me how this is unprofessional](https://preview.redd.it/gdd4v5uoizg31.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ffef30bfbc5703eced7433535cc94b96eeff32e1).

I've noticed a trend lately. Gaming,  unlike a lot of other hobbies, requires a lot of investment, eg MP games  like Apex where you would play the game for a long time. Plus it's an  interactive medium, you are the one controlling the character etc,  you're gonna get a lot more of an emotional investment out of it  compared to other mediums generally, because you are the star of the  show.

But a lot of gamers\^TM seem  unable to distance themselves from their identity/the game, and when  something goes wrong they don't like or whatever they take it as a  personal attack. Because they've been playing this game for so long, so  how fucking dare you change something that I don't like.

And there many cases of what I said above. I can name a few. For example: Ooblets devs were calling other gamers not their fans toxic and look what happened to them. From straight up harassment,racist slurs, just slurs being thrown left and right to faking screenshots to make them look bad. It's almost like they proved a point by saying that the Gamers who never even heard of their game were going to react that way by them calling them toxic and if you say they deserved all of that they actually did not. Another case was a female dev in r/totalwar was calling the amount of waifus creepy, and she got harassed so much that she had to leave. Now imagine if Jay left after all this shit. I know you wouldn't want that.

Developers in the gaming industry hating their fan bases is normal considering how the fan bases are toxic to them plus  [the whole bullshit they have to deal with daily in the gaming industry doesn't help either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLAi_cmly6Q&feature=youtu.be). Hell this even is true for the indie dev scene. The best example of this is Rami Ismail the 50% developer of Nuclear Throne. That guy hates the living shit out of his community and you can get that feeling from his tweets and his rants. 

People seem to want perfect video games and developers that capitulate  to their every whim. Even though what they want in the game seems to  change week by week. You stay quiet as a dev = ""They don't care  anymore"". You respond as a dev = ""Blah blah blah PR shill bullshit"".  Developers are damned if they do and damned if they don't. And they  wonder why people call them entitled.  Best example of this is the Overwatch forums. Devs communicate they get shit on. Devs don't communicate they wonder why the devs are not communicating with them.

[A relevant rant by someone](https://youtu.be/nKtomu0f1-Q).

Yes I agree the pricing of the Apex iron crowd and the skins is too fucking expensive ,but the only reason I don't feel personally attacked by the devs comments is because I am not the one blaming the devs for this. Sure they admitted to changing the model of events ,but again the one who is doing the pricing behind this shit is always the publisher. EA is the one who is behind prices and well considering how well Apex is doing no wonder EA is trying to get that cash dolla dolla in their pockets. It's always the publisher or higher management who does this kind of shit. I mean many examples of this can be done with Activision. Black Ops 4 had no MT's on launch and look at the shit it has now. Destiny 2: Activision wasn't happy how the DLC sold while the devs were so Activision said more MT's pls.",apexlegends,1566130875.0,t3_cs0jl8
As A Community We Need To Support Respawn,"Reading through posts on this subreddit today, I see many people unsatisfied with the Battle Pass and people who continually talk down to the dev team.

&#x200B;

Give the dev team a break. Respawn managed to put out a game that was a record breaking success with a team one third of the size of their biggest competition, Fortnite. Epic Games has had a year and a half to work on ideas, get community feedback and bring the game to the state it is in now. They have also had a year and a half to grow the dev team to organically support the growth. Respawn has had 6 weeks.

&#x200B;

As a community, we shouldn't hold Respawn to the same standard. I doubt that the small team expected to shatter records and do it as fast as they have. I have no doubt they want to put out the best content possible, which is evident in the game itself. Yes changes need to be made, but that will come with time.

What I learned after 1300 hours of Apex,"9 out of 10 Apex players are bad, and they tend to stay bad. This is the actual reason why Respawn don't add solos - because people who know how to play will just wipe lobbies.

Solo players are always stronger than team players. Solo players tend to use their brain because they often face 1v3s and no one can help them except themselves, while team players prefer to make simple decisions based on the info by their teammates, which is often just a misinformation. This is how players like Ace or Albralelie become the best in Apex Legends.

There're only 4 legends and 4 guns worth using. Still.

Playing this game for more than 3-4 hours per day is a wasting of time and brain cells.

It takes a lot of time for devs to realize what do they actually need to do to improve the game.

I hate being Plat and getting bronzes on my team, particularly when I can't even que up with my irl friends who are bronze. Also, in that same scenario I feel bad running over bronzes in my Plat lobby. Also, higher tiers having higher entry costs is reasonable I think, higher than current but perhaps lower than previously. Though I don't think the opt in info we have is representative of the player base as a whole, it does seem to not be at a healthy balance at the top end.

HOWEVER, I think having placement be 80%+ of the points is a good thing for game diversity. Mixtape is there for those who just wanna frag,  pubs is still there for those who wanna drop hot and chase  shots. But ranked should be a little more cerebral in terms of placement and positioning. 

Seriously, I have had some of the most intense and enjoyable endgame in ranked this season than I have in a long time ( week 1 player). That minute as you are waiting for the final circle to start to close, huddled under cover trying to figure out the best way to rotate in relation to where you think other squads are... it's brilliant. 7 squads in final circle is tense, even if 3 of them are solo rats.

 And solo rats really don't stand a chance against a squad, so basically I am grateful  they ditched their team to die, while they rated to the end in white shield. Actually makes things easier for me most times.

The problem, of course, is those rats who just drop away from team and hide the whole game being on your team. Basically turning you into a duo in a game of trios. I hate this, I think it deserves a report for sabotage and inactive.  But at the same time, as much as I don't like it, some people do like to play that way. A lot actually, based on my anecdotal experience. So what's the compromise?  No team fill Solo que options for ranked. More rats perhaps, but its the life they chose and it won't affect others as much. Full teams will still beam them in the back as they run away and laugh as it goes from 4 squads to 3. And us players who want to play for position but NOT rat in a corner for 15+ min won't be burdened by them on our team.

TL;DR

yeah let's tweak ranked a little to make it not favor higher tiers as much, but overall a ranked system that favors position over kills is healthy, good and fun. Add solo que to ranked to minimize the unfun impact ranked rats have on the population at large.

What do you think? What are some other criticisms of ranked I may have missed? I'm feeling quite philosophical so I would appreciate some good discussion, thanks  legends!",apexlegends,1688938551.0,t3_14vaktz

Why is controller catered for *on PC*,"I fully understand that aim assist is essential for console players as they are locked to controller and 90% of console players don't just have a keyboard and mouse to plug in not to mention the horrible input lag that comes with this.

But why pc? Why do we need to give aim assist to controller on pc?
On pc you can choose to play controller or mnk, why do you deserve compensation for choosing to play the worse input?",apexlegends,1668823819.0,t3_yz10nc

Whats the Best Gun In Apex?,,apexlegends,1657929485.0,t3_w02uqs
The Spitfire should not be coming out of the Care Package.,"The Spitfire needs to stay in there. It’s going to be meta again, everyone and their mothers are going to be running it, it’s going to be as painful as it was before it went in.

Give us back the G7. Give it a fire rate nerf and a small damage nerf and it’ll be good. I don’t ever remember anyone complaining about it and I’m still annoyed that it’s in there. It’s an easy gun to learn and reliable, but without the incessant “gat-gat-gat” of the Spitfire that everyone is dreading.

Stop Bitching about 3rd Parties. There are no rules to how to fight in Apex.,"Honestly, It is a no hold bars game and any thing goes. The only rule is to kill and be the last one standing. Nobody waits around for a fight to finish to start another and you dont either. Creatively killing opponents using ambushes is a legal move in apex. Learn not to rub blindly into buildings.Stop bitching and learn to fight and using every advantage you can muster.",apexlegends,1649761237.0,t3_u1wdc7

"with SBMM not only respawn destroyed casual, but also destroyed Ranked and how you're supposed to grind","Let me explain, 

i'm a decent PC Apex player i'd say better than average, currently diamond 2 on my main, made it to diamond 4 last season.

my friends and I are heartbroken about the current situation of the game so we went smurfing, like ""hey could be fun, how long would it take to get to diamond ?""

and guess what, that was kind of obvious but.. it's full of smurf, in bronze winning was hard, in silver winning was hard, and so in gold and platinum, winning was hard.

we first made it to diamond in One week and that was kind of effortless at the launch of season 3, but here took us 2 week and was way harder i mean, is that what Respawn want ? 

how can somebody that start the game, start in bronze, is supposed to find people at his level, but gets matched with tryhard smurfs ? i honnestly think it's nearly impossible for a new player to get started into the game right now, Respawn, you guys really need to do something, nobody, except unemployed people that can play more than 15 hours a day are having fun with this.",apexlegends,1576015542.0,t3_e8xk0i
Am I the only one who already hates Wattson?,"Don't take me wrong, I really like her design and I find the concept interesting, but these are some new mechanics to the game and I am very worried it will affect the gameplay significantly! Here are my worries

1. I don't like ""building"" in FPS games. So far, all the characters had temporary items. This will build basically a house around you. Maybe not that useful in open areas, but it will turn any building or even places like pit or respawn areas in the mountains into hell. Imagine places like skulltown, bunker, runoff, water treatement... all these covered in web traps. 
2. Zoning - so far it was only up to you how you approached the enemy. There was nothing which would hold you back and if you got punished, it was only your faul, not the game mechanics. This new ability tells you how to approach enemy. My favorite play-style, as a guy coming from quake, is close the gap as much as possible and get into close combat. This will be now almost impossible during many fight, because fences can cover huuuuge area and block everyone outside.
3. Flanking - sometimes you want to play smart. Your teams cover enemies in bullets while you flank them from the back and then you snap them in your scissors. Especially when enemies are camping semi-opened spots, this was super-effective. Now you spend your time to flank enemies, you know the map so that's your leverage - shoot, there is a wall which wasn't there before.

Don't take me wrong, I don't say her abilities are not putting new great aspect in the game, that it won't be about skills, I am just worried it will change the gameplay the way as we know it. So far, my feeling of the game was that the abilities are a spice to your skill and the core was the shooting, compared to for example overwatch. With this character, my feeling is that she's only all about the abilities. I don't know if you understand me, my english is pretty bad. I am looking forward and I just hope I am completely wrong and stupid :-(",apexlegends,1560066999.0,t3_byhzo4

Respawn appreciation!,"I just thought I’d express my gratitude to respawn for the amazing job they did with Apex legends. The movement, shooting, pace, all of it is great. And the lack of game modes and variety was a great addition as well. Once I got bored of this game, which obviously wasn’t hard given the lack of variety and game modes, I found myself wanting more! So I fired up fortnite for the first time since it released. And I am having a blast. There’s so much variety, so many different game modes, fun little goofy stuff to ride and play with. It’s really been a blast. But without apex I would not have given fortnite another try so I want to say thank you respawn for reigniting my interest in a previously forgotten game. You guys have done a great job!",apexlegends,1557615180.0,t3_bni4nu

More proof Season 1 was supposed to release March 12th and why I think it will release tomorrow,"If you can’t tell by the accidental update to origin launcher. Season 1 was supposed to release Tuesday March 12th. Tuesday is when the console stores update and Respawn is a good company and likes to keep them timed perfectly. (Some games launch updates 2 weeks before console on PC). 

They have fixed the exploit which was probably the main reason they didn’t update it. Won’t explain how to do it but basically, 1000 free apex coins in seconds per account. The the battle pass launching for 950 Respawn would have lost a lot of money they could have made. 

It was supposed to launch March 12th and now it is clear it was. Ads have been popping up on websites for the Battle pass since the 13th. Usually games advertise right after a big update. Well Respawn I’m assuming had those ad spots lined up before hand. 

People who are saying that they should have had this ready before launch. They probably did. The exploit definitely pushed back their timeline. 

They, like us, are very eager to release this. We need I remember they want it out just as bad as we do. IT MAKES THEM MONEY. 

With it being advertise and the exploit being fixed. And then probably having it ready is why I believe it will release tomorrow.

What are they trying to do with ranked? (Old predator player),"I played Apex religiously when it came out and I stopped playing around season 5 after I finished with a predator rank and got busy with life. I've come back now and ranked seems so unfun.

Why is Apex so focused on forcing people to go for placements, rather than playing the game? I understand the need to reward placements, but it feels like it's placements or nothing at this point. If I get 10 kills a game I shouldn't be able to still lose my rank, It just seems crazy to me. Back when the game first came out the biggest complaint I saw was about rats in ranked, but now it seems like that's the only way to play. ",apexlegends,1705670757.0,t3_19aj1dn

Just a quick shoutout about something that's been bugging me lately. We all love the game, right? But let's not forget, there's a bunch of different folks playing - teens, adults, all kinds of backgrounds, and people with disabilities too.

It's cool to have our own style and all, but the hate and toxicity lately? Not cool at all. Remember, we're here to enjoy the game our own way. No need to ruin someone else's fun.

To the grown-ups, seriously? Calling out young players or anyone with those terrible words? That's not what we're about.
