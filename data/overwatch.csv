Do you think it would be possible to file a class action lawsuit towards blizzard?,"Not saying I will. I was just thinking about it and was wondering how others felt about it.

I paid $60 for a game that was good, and worked and I enjoyed, only for them to take that away completely and replace it with an objectively inferior product that didn't even have all the promised features in the first place. They couldn't even keep the product I paid for running along side the new product that is now free for everyone. And something about that feels really really scummy.

Just had a support throw three seperate games because they were complaining about other teammates,"First game on the opposite team, they threw by not participating and leaving the team 1 support down.
 Next game, they were on my team, within the first minute, they complained about my healing and said they would do the same as last game if I didnt do more. They then proceeded to throw in the same way.
 About an hour later, I'm in another game first round is a back and forth but my team takes it in the end. Second round I see the enemy team type in chat ""healers are throwing"" then the same support who threw the other games chimes in ""i cant contoll the useless tank"".

A Discussion about support and Damage,"I hope the title is done in the best of my ability and knowledge cause it about me as a support 
But also me talking about the team who pick damages. New time posting so if I get anything wrong I full heartedly agree if the post needs to be taken down 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello! I have been playing overwatch sense about 2017 and I have come across this couple of times but I’m not fully understanding why people get so mad about it. I’m in a match and at the start I played as Illari, we were winning until a Sombra showed up and would never go after my damage just me, my other support did nothing the first round. So I switched to Moira to help combat not only the Sombra but also help combat the tank MAUGA on the enemy team.
 We won the first round and I had about 15 kills, the end of the second round I had ask my dps if they could like, help me get rid of the Sombra so I can focus more of my healing and not have to play dps Moira all the time. They didn’t respond so I took it as maybe they would help me. The enemy had taken the point until 85% and when I asked them, “ if you can’t play Hanzo or junkrat  may you please switch off I have a really good winning streak and I don’t want to loose it."" they had 5 and 8 kills the whole three rounds. 
i had 24 as Moira and Illari. they start completely going off the rails and even the zenyatta yelling and cussing at me for just asking them if they could switch cause i had 8,789 Damage and 5,134 healing cause anytime i would get to them when they were critical, they would already be dead by the enemy team, and when I were with them, they would already be full of health. they started screaming at me that I wasn't doing healing, but how am I supposed to heal when the DPS are really doing anything which makes me have to be DPS for them and then they want to cuss me out when i'm not healing them because not only does Moira healing is small but because i keep dying to the sombra i cant help that i'm not there every second of the round for them. 

So when I’m basically trying to ask is why does DPS get so mad at support for asking them to take care of a character that is having a hard time for the support to be supports and why can’t I asked them if you don’t know how to play Hanzo or junk rat ( both two dps were playing these two characters) or you’re not very good at it and I’m having to do both which I shouldn’t have because you chose to play DPS in role pick, why are they going to scream and cuss me out if honestly I ask them nicely and I think it unfair for me to do both and then get yelled at for pointing out my frustration. I understand overwatch is just for fun but if it’s for fun, why am I having to stress out taking care of this team if they’re going to yell at me for just asking them to switch. 

There’s other characters you can play there’s over 37 characters that you can play that you could do well at and if you just wanna have fun, you could just go into AI I’m just overall confused of why I got yelled at. 
And if there’s any other way I could get tips on how to ask Team Mate to switch without sounding rude, which I wasn’t rude, but they were men and just flip the chats that woman was asking them to change.

This is not to be hating on anyone or I don’t wanna arguments in the comments about if I was wrong or if they were wrong I am just wondering like what am I supposed to do in the situation to make it better for not only my team, but also if I come across this again.",Overwatch,1706040312.0,t3_19dxjdt

What If Efi Was A Hero? | Hero Concept,"Name:  Efi Oladele (Orisa’s creator)

Role: Support

Health: 125 health, 75 shields



Primary Fire: Wrench throw 
Throw a projectile wrench with a big hit box that deals increased damage to armor. (1 ammo.)



Secondary Fire: Energy Wave
Use an old OR15 hand to blast a healing wave. This wave heals less the more it travels. (70-50 healing based on distance. 5 ammo. Pierces through teammates.)



Ability 1: Override Net
Throw a net that can attach up to three enemies in the area hit. This net makes it so any damage dealt to anyone in the net is also shared to the other enemies in the net. (Lasts 5 seconds. Shared damage is reduced by 45%)



Ability 2: Glitch Sphere
Send out a holographic sphere that pulls enemies to the center of it. (Orisa’s old halt ability.)



Ultimate: Fire Wall
Create a big glowing shield, that deflects every enemy projectile for 8 seconds. (No damage can go through this shield. Indestructible.)



Passive: Anti-Virus
When one of Efi’s cooldowns are on cooldown, she gains a 10% speed boost. When both abilities are on cooldown, she gains a 15% speed boost.

My brother in christ, there is no amount of healing that will save you from dying while repeeking the same angle and standing there for too long.

And then simply getting people to group the fuck up. You're not going to go super saiyan and get a lucky potshot on the mercy from 50m away as a soldier. You're not helping by sprinting ahead and peeking a character that can one shot you while the rest of us are coming out of spawn. So many different situations...

Even after reports, I changed my way of communication avoiding saying bad words and changing everything in general, and still, I got muted for 13 days, I wonder why?

Are DPS players just cosmetic in this game or do you just get bots after a few rounds.,Idk Lately if I play any other roll than dps my dps are good for like 3 matches and then the next 5 they go like 2-9 and one even went 3-17. They blamed supports and tank of course even tho they had 14k+16k healing done that match from their supports which is far more than the other team. The Tank didn't seem that bad either because he outlasted them every time but because nobody was dying he would eventually have to back up or die. Seems like the ranking system likes to humble you if you seem to be on any kind of winning streak and if you aren't prepared to take over as the dps in other rolls your as good as done.  ,Overwatch,1706024310.0,t3_19dr5v7

Support Achievements Question,"Hey so I had a quick question about some of the support achievements regarding specific characters.  I really enjoy and want to get even better at some of the supports, but I am having a very difficult time obtaining some of them on specific characters and it makes me think that not being able to get them kind of means I'm just not good at them or not playing them right at all.  Specifically lifeweaver for instance.  I feel like I do fairly well with using his entire kit, healing and doing alright damage every game, making a few saves here and there or repositioning someone out of an ult or etc.  but I just can't seem to get 3 saves in 1 life or the X amount of healing with 1 tree.  This also goes for lucio and his 3 kills while wall riding.  I know people say just boop off 3 people then wall ride before they die but I feel like that is really hard to get, esp after they see im lucio and stay a mile away from a ledge.

I just want to know is it normal to take a long time to get these, and should it discourage me from playing them in that I might possibly not be playing them correctly if I can't get their achievements?

Edit: Also, I seem to get really wrapped up in the post game stats that are attached to a character and feel like if I'm not raising them all decent then I'm not playing them right either.

Just started playing OW after 4 years away,"I played comp placements and landed in gold. Every game we lose first fight, the whole team just starts being nasty and blaming.

I tried to encourage positivity but both teams started flaming me as healer. I had most healing in match. I don't understand. I play other games that are notorious for bad communities, but OW2 takes the cake no contest. 

People should not be freaking out this much over gold lobbies. I understand as a team based game you will lose frequently even though you play great, and I won't be putting my best foot forward every game, but I get several matches where it seems like half my team is already on full tilt before we've made it 30 seconds into the match.

There were discussions on the playerbase back when I started OW in 2016, its by no contest far worse now. Downvote me all you want but this game is made unenjoyable by a lot of the people that play it. I used to love OW but the experience now is just miserable. ",Overwatch,1706009489.0,t3_19dmdoy

Just tried the assault maps for the first time. I'm a fan.,"Got tired of playing mystery heroes in my down time so I switched to assault maps on arcade. I have a few things to say about it.

I can see why this game mode is both hated and loved. The maps are beautiful. There are plenty of team fights. There's a bunch of action and room for playmaking. And the objective is simple. You either cap the point or stop the enemy from capping. There's no need to worry about keeping the robot a certain distance from the enemy spawn, or how many people you keep on the payload and how many will push up. You don't get your rhythm messed up in between different maps. You just have one simple thing to do in this mode. 

I despise open queue and have had some of my favorite matches playing assault. I finally see why so many people want Hanamura back. Winning a nice back and forth game on attack feels *so* good - which brings me to my next point. 

Like many opinions that I've read about the mode, I'd have to agree that the map favors the defenders. The game has for some reason decided to put me on the defenders side about 80% of my matches. It's so easy to defend on these maps if you have a good comp. The spawn advantage on second point is ridiculous. I can't even imagine playing this mode in competitive where every single round goes into overtime. 

Overall, I'd want 2cp back in role queue. It'd probably become my favorite game mode.",Overwatch,1705986359.0,t3_19dgnqq

Who is the least smartest character lore wise?,"I say Ashe. Ashe has a gang and an omnic butler, still loses to one guy who is literally holding back from killing them. Meanwhile Ashe is completely filled with bloodlust on wanting him dead.

Cassidy uses his surroundings to his advantage (e.g using falling boulders as a cover while reposition). Ashe continues mindlessly standing in the wide open even after she got stunned by a flashbang and nearly got shot. 

Ashe has better numbers and arsenal but she still utilizes poorly. Like she could have sent BOB to grab Cassidy while everyone provides suppressing fire, Ashe also can use dynamite to blow up Cassidy or force him out of cover.

Ashe also didn't learn anything from her defeat. Her greediness actually led to her downfall that she could have gone home with plenty of spoils in exchange of letting Cassidy and Echo walk free, but now she goes home empty handed (plus losing a bike).

Support rework ideas for fun pt2,"Title, This is the second half of my ideas, which I wrote out because i was bored. 

Aimed at balancing characters around how annoying they can be to deal with more than their actual impact. 


Kiriko:

Headshot damage dropped to 90. 

TP cooldown bumped to 8 seconds. 

I got nothing for Suzu. It's annoying but it's also not horribly imbalanced imo, it together with everything else is the problem to me, and I play Ana predominantly, so I'm used to getting cleansed but eh, that's fair enough. It's a bit needed atm to deal with insanely high burst damage.

Reasonings: Yes yes I get it, high skill ceiling for aim. However, more often than not this kills you through ranged random spam. 140 damage on a single spammed support Character is NUTS. 90 means you don't get double dinked by lucky spam halfway across the map but still take enough damage to get the message and fuck off. If she lands 3, you're either really unlucky or you over stayed your welcome. 
In a close up duel, It would be 2 head taps and a melee or a body shot. That's fair imo. Even as a support main I feel like kirikos damage output is just way too high for someone as survivable as she is. Lucio is hella survivable but he needs either a perfect 4 hit burst to match her damage or a combo. She's more survivable than he is at times and can consistently just out damage him on pure luck.

It should take SOMETHING more than hoping two headshots connect, and on players that actually do have good aim, she's more dangerous than many DPS are at times. Pretty much everyone she fights has to land ALOT of shots to kill her, but she only has to land 2, can invuln for a second to dodge big cooldowns, heals a burst of 80hp, and after 6 seconds can just vanish. Half the time you are fighting her she's tp'd in with a flanker and only has to land one shot for the flanker to confirm your death.

Its a bit much imo and I don't think these changes would be a massive reduction to her effectiveness, but it would make her less annoying and less able to do things that are a bit dumb. 


Ana:

Split sleep and Anti into two charges, each at half duration (and damage in antis case, though I would love to see the chaos of full damage double antis lmao) 

Reasoning:

The anti point has been made before, people dislike it. I as an Ana player don't really agree that it's a source of an issue, but a symptom. 
However, I can agree that 3 whole seconds where possibly no one can be healed is an issue at times. 
With how much burst damage and healing is in the game, I do think it's needed to keep some of that in check, but sure, 3 seconds on one throw is probably a bit much. 1.5 seconds gives your team a good shot at either confirming a kill or making a sizeable dent in their HP so the other team struggles a bit more to heal it up and landing the second means you can continue that, or give someone else an issue to deal with.

With sleep, this moves it somewhat closer to being an interrupt rather than a hard stun. Sleep being a high skill to hit thing I think its pretty fair as is right now, but it would be nice to have two for various situations even at half effectiveness. 

It also kinda helps a bit with dealing with various situations, and it gives you a chance to correct a mistake someone makes in waking someone up when you've just hit them. 
 

Mercy: Rez revives at 20%HP. If you want to rez at a higher HP level, you MUST commit to more time spent holding the cast. 80% is the max, takes 3 seconds to reach full charge. LOS breaking disables the cast. 

Damage boost can be applied for 5 seconds and then it swaps to healing. Cannot apply damage boost to the same target for another 5 seconds. If you flick between dmg boost and healing, it locks you out for however long that damage boost was applied. I.E, 2 sec boost, 2 sec cooldown on that character. 5 secs is your maximum at a time. 

Sympathetic healing is disabled.

GA time increased to 4 seconds, GA burst heals her for 40hp. Jumping from GA sends you 25% further.

Reasoning: 
Mercy was my first character in 2017. I learnt the game with her and I think she's a fantastic character with a higher skill ceiling than people give her credit for. That being said, she enables braindead gameplay way too much. I play her and love doing it, yet I also watch other mercys and regularly think ""How do you get away with something as dumb as that?""

Rez is a problem but I don't feel it's conceptually broken just executed poorly. 
If you want to quickly dart in and rez in a risky situation your team should be required to cover for you. This is rarely the case. More often than not she can just hold that Button down and revive as soon as you die or fly straight to someone and rez them without much risk. 

These changes make it so that she CAN pick someone up immediately, but she MUST provide support to that person instead of just fucking off again and having a full HP, likely full cooldown character back in play for free.
Again, your team should have to cover for a rez, not just expect and get it for nothing.
If you want to bring someone back at a higher amount of HP, again you have to cover her longer. 
Mercy should have to think about this properly. If someone dies, a mistake was made, you shouldn't get a blank slate for a mistake. 

Damage boost timer and lock out is to prevent pocketing someone with damage boost indefinitely.  

Properly cycling damage and heals is how you play mercy well, but you still get insane value for just doing one or the other, this stops that and encourages you to play her in the way that is optimal, it's both a restriction on her most annoying method of play, and a semi enforced teaching tool to teach mercy players how to rotate their damage boost between players and not just to focus on pockets. 

Sympathetic healing, is dumb. It's lifesteal from moira but through healing onto a team mate and it makes killing a Mercy extremely tedious, I disagree with its existence. 

GA cooldown encourages a mercy to be more selective with it, and to position better in general so shes in less danger but can heal people more readily, it should be a commitment to fly to someone and help them. Again, a learning tool baked into her design. The GA jump distance boost is to let you position more creatively or nope out of a bad GA a bit better. 

The GA health boost helps compensate for the drop in survivability, if you dont interrupt her healing after she has GA'd, her passive will kick in. 

So you have more time to kill her in general after she has used GA but if she's escaping she does have a better chance of survival.",Overwatch,1705967178.0,t3_19da8j3

Support Character rework ideas for fun pt 1,"Title, this is cuz I'm bored but would also like to see them. Most of these aren't aimed at massively changing the balance but are aimed at making said characters less annoying, with the first character being an exception, I just want that change personally. 

Split into two parts for length. Part 2- ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/s/MAtkw9RZ41 )

Lucio: 

When on healing aura, booping team mates burst heals them for 40hp. Speed aura gives them a 1 second speed boost (speed boost % doesnt stack with aura)

Boop takes your movement direction into account and pushes you in that direction a small bit. Like a minor dash of a couple meters.(this one really is for fun only. Would give his mobility a bit of extra flair.) 

Reasoning:
Nice bit of extra healing, let's you give particular team mates the ability to chase a bit more or get away further, while being able to continue healing, more decisions to make for lucio when helping team mates. 




Moira:

Primary fire(I always refer to the damage as primary fire) doesn't life steal
   It's honestly kinda dumb, I play alotta Moira when I want to swap between large amounts of healing in tight knit comps or flex out to help kill the backline or defend my other support, her lifesteal plus the auto accuracy really isn't something she should have on Primary fire.

When I'm fighting a moira one on one I'll literally stand still and just focus on my aim if I Don't have an easy escape, zero point in trying to dodge her shots so I might as well make aiming easier on myself.

Orb:
  Remove the bouncing around. Moira picks a spot, same way Ram shield works, and the Orb flies to that spot (Tagging anyone along the way for health or damage) and hovers there until its either expended its payload, or 5 seconds have passed. Orb damage has life steal (Not multiplicative of how many are being damaged)

Reasonings: Skill orb is a long standing meme, and it's annoying, both to use and face. 

If you're using it, you almost always only get some of the benefit of it unless you're tossing it right into the middle of a massive group of heavily damaged team mates or enemies. Otherwise it just passes by and then vanishes into narnia unless you're doing something niche like bouncing it straight up into the ceiling, which is funny but overall not that helpful. If you're facing it then it's basically a coin toss on it flying away after the first pass or chasing you down like a vengeful spirit and killing you through sheer luck.

Picking where it stops means you can do things like block flanks, cut off a retreat, deny an area, or with healing you can give it to a dedicated team mate, give your whole team a temp healing turret and stuff like that. I'd infinitely prefer this over the chaotic skill orb we have. More options, less random bullshit.
Giving it the lifesteal means she can retain the same extra survivability lifesteal gives her but it's not just about being within 20 meters of her now, it's about being within a few meters of the orb. Helps her a bit but also stops the whole braindead jumping into the backline because she WILL just survive until the fade cooldown is over. You can move and position a bit more with her abilities in mind.",Overwatch,1705967036.0,t3_19da6iv

If I play damage and my Elims are low even though I’m actually getting solo kills as early picks, I’m immediately bad because of it. It’s especially bad because they don’t show more detailed stats, like showing healing prevented by Ana nade or players saved, and things like Lucio speed boost are basically not accounted for at all.

Absolutely broken matchmaking in dia and the real hell of playing solo in group of 4.,"

Hello, i am an phlegmatic person but everyday i get mad with this game but usually i keep my pain in my head... today i almost lost it and smash up my pc...I play solo dps as always.  


Every day hard grinding solo hell... First game we got toxic feeding zarya, next game we have feeding widow who left and now the worst of the worst: Another match, we got diffed so much, other dps were negative kd, so between round i checked and see that they are in group, ask them if they are in one group and yes...checked the profile of other dps and boom GOLD 5...GOLD 5 in DIA match wow wow wow.   
I ask them why are they boosting him and ofc all toxic, but the problem is blizzard not them...Is this game dying? Or why they even create this caricature of competitive matches?  


I grind everyday, its so hard to play solo, also i have to play soldier or sombra or similar self-sustainable heroes to not be expecting in some kind of teamplay but what is this...ofc you can see sure its just one bad game...no its getting worse and worse...all the time toxic, one trick...i thought it will be different in diamand but tough luck. I would rather wait 10 - 15 minutes for matchmaking for 5 solo vs 5 solo than this shit.  


HM2SKY -  i was soldier, then sombra...ofc i threw and did some mistakes after realizing we are done...have fun and dont forget to write me, it was totally my fault, not the plat tank or that GOLD 5 dps (iiiiiii know its not his fault, its blizzards, but still. i told him to play counter hanzo at least..ofc he did not go anything usefull). if this was 5 SOLO VS 5 SOLO i would not get that mad, but this is just BS, big blizzard bs, that deserver another negative review on steam, yuck.

reporting system," 

The current reporting system in Overwatch 2 appears to be experiencing issues and requires significant improvement. Users are encountering account losses, some of which they have held for several years, due to seemingly innocuous statements such as expressing a preference for a specific hero or requesting role swaps. There is also concern about the occurrence of troll banning in stacks, where a group of players reports an individual who is performing well, resulting in an automatic AI ban.

Even casual comments like “Pharah, you like that headshot” during gameplay have reportedly led to bans, with the AI system flagging such interactions. The consequences extend beyond mere account suspension, as users are losing valuable in-game assets, including skins, amounting to significant financial losses. The absence of human review by game masters exacerbates the situation, as all bans are currently handled by AI without providing adequate explanations upon request.

The lack of transparency in the ban process, coupled with the absence of clear reasons for bans, raises concerns among the community. While it is understandable that severe violations, such as homophobic or racist behavior, should warrant strict consequences, the current system lacks a nuanced approach. Users are calling for a more balanced and transparent review process, urging developers to address these issues promptly and comprehensively.",Overwatch,1705948814.0,t3_19d2ttw

"All ""impossible"" support mechanics explained and simpified.","I'm sick of seeing people's saying that OW is just a world of magic and that support's skills make no sense. I may not have a degree in science or any experience in tech.

So let's get through this:

Lucio - obviously his healing isn't ""just music."" It's most likely minute nanobots that are able to enter in one's body through his or her ears and make the necessary repairs. That's also why his healing is slow and have a limited range: it's based on his weapon (the HQ device). Speed boost is the same: it enters the body to strengthen the legs and cardio.

Mercy - people say Dmg boost makes no sense. Some said that it is an enhance for the body, but this doesn't explain why projectiles like bullets are affected by it. The reality is that Mercy's blue beam casts a barrier around the body. Anything that pierces the barrier takes on an elctro-effect that strengthens it. This accounts for all attacks. 

Rez and healing would be similar. Since OW characters don't get mortally wounded, we can assume that an HP bar is only representative of their heart and when their heart gives out. Rez is simply a super-charged electric shock to reawaken the heart. 

Baptiste - his is similar to Mercy's. It doesn't ""negate dying""; it provides a barrier that repels attacks. 

Kiriko - It is more likely that Kiriko's tailsmen are actually just robotic healing-aids. We can see this in the animatic short: when she places on the old dude, it lights up and heals him. Also, her ult performs similar to lucio's, in a sense that it ""enters"" the body as a stimulant. This falls in line with Overwatch's universe's logic and explain why it wouldn't work for enemy's: Kiriko employed a special code so that it is only activated for her teammates. You might say that suzu works the same way, but it is actually realistic that suzu is just an ancient formula passed down from tradition.

Lifeweaver: how can a plant HEAL? Obviously, it functions as a repair station, where the waves emitted from the tree repairs the body.

Ana - why do some of ana's bullets heals and others heart? This is clearly because it's a smart gun: when the scop passes a target, it scans the enemy. Ana places codes on her teammates, and anyone without the code gets hurt. You may be thinking why her grenade, for that matter, can splatter both enemies and teammates at the same time. The answer is simple: it's a smart grenade. The liquid contains two states. Once it is on a person without the code, it activates a poison (the dmg for the poison negates healing) and activates a healing agent that accelerates repair functions for teammates.

Zen - don't listen to any of that magic nonsense. Zen's discords are very simple: yellow orb is a host of bots that enter the body to make repairs; purple orb is a host of bots that dispels the body's defense mechanisms, causing more weakness. 

Brig - Now HOW can HITTING someone heal? It's actually pretty simple. when the flail makes contact, it expels a healing agent that immediately seeks her teammates. The friction and energy from bashing would power the flail here so she can use it infinitely without worrying about ""charging"" the device. That's why she has to hit things.

so yeah like I said OW is not ""magic""; everything has a purpose.",Overwatch,1705948249.0,t3_19d2l8i

I hope season 9 is the beginning of big yearly updates to freshen things up,"Big balance changes, new heroes and reworks, new maps and updates to existing maps, new game modes and updates to existing game modes, battlepass improvements, new and easier ways to get and earn cosmetics, and bringing back limited time competitive modes like mystery heroes or (hot take) 2cp.

Also bringing back some old features like LFG and the general player levels. I like the new progression system but I think it just needs better icons, but there's no reason not to have general player levels from OW1 with the player border and the more indepth hero and role progression systems together. Maybe even a clan like system?

I hope Overwatch does something similar to how league of legends has yearly seasons.

Blizzard has an opportunity with season 9 to start a new year with the new matchmaking system and soft MMR reset combined with upcoming passive updates and many balance changes. It's one way to keep the game fresh and fun.

I know Blizzard has a longer timeline for the game that we don't know about, and that's okay but I thought I'd throw out some ideas to see what other people think and see if there's any worthwhile discussion around it.

Also pls just straight up delete souvenirs from the game.

Edit: Since I've been playing The Finals a bit, they have a tournament game mode where you basically play 3 matches with the final 2 teams playing against each other. I think a solo / duo queue mode  where you do something similar could be fun to find a random team and try to win the tournament over 3 matches.",Overwatch,1705940429.0,t3_19czdkh

From bronze to plat Ball experience,"After playing since launch being bronze my role career, I decided one day that I was going to get good. I always loved ball so I thought I'd use him. That, and he does pretty well without relying on his team so much.

I understand that the play experience is so much better with the chat turned off. If I turned it off, I wouldn't have seen the difference of reactions. I'm still climbing and pretty steadily.

At first, the chat reactions were flaming me because I chose ball. Before I started gaining the level of expertise with ball I have now, it was pretty hit or miss how the team would react. Primarily it was negative. 

As I started getting better and started getting win streaks, my confidence rose and my gameplay got better and better. I'm not actually at Platinum yet but I'm about to hit it for the first time. I haven't played in about a week and jumped on before I started my day. I played 4 games and won 4 games. It is extremely rewarding hearing my team congratulate me on actually playing ball well. With balls reputation as the worst tank in the game, I like this versus how it used to be when I just sucked.

What is funny now is now I get the opposing team chat coming in about how the ball player has no life or doesn't shower LOL. I think this is just funny. As ball, I love to fire back against toxicity with positivity because it it's a kind of troll move if you think about it.  It also earns me more endorsements. 

For once in my overwatch career, I'm doing pretty well.",Overwatch,1705933006.0,t3_19cwm0x

I really think it’d be cool if we got a character inspired by Dante from DMC.,"A weapon swapper who is a master of movement and can adapt himself to various scenarios sounds awesome.

Tanks are not the leader of a team,I notice a lot of the time that teams tend to gather around their tank even they’re not performing well. And tanks themselves except their team to be behind them at all time. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve  noticed the tank leading their team to defeat whether that’s being stuck at a choke or not using multiple routes to get to the objective. Instead of the other 4 players taking autonomy and making plays to make it easier for the team they just stand and shoot where their tank is not contributing whatsoever to their victory. And honestly it’s frustrating when you want to tell your teammates that they should follow you or at least spread out just because most players are more inclined to follow rather than lead or at least play their own game.

What am I supposed to do I love ow but these queues are horrible it's just not a fun experience if nothing is dying and it ends up with everyone on my team having 3-4 kills while the enemy has 30+ how do I have fun on a game I love if this is how every match keeps going",Overwatch,1705886902.0,t3_19cjpza

What are you guys' thoughts on the patch notes released on January 9th?,I made a video on this specific set of patch notes and my reactions to it but i wanted to hear the subreddits thoughts as well before i reupload my video tomorrow evening.,Overwatch,1705885671.0,t3_19cjamc
Do you think roles have lost their identities?,"I was watching a video from an OW content creator about the next changes on S9 (the DPS and Tank self healing), and while writing a reply that thought crossed my mind.

Supports passed from giving some kind of utility (movement, damage, making easier to kill enemies, heal block, etc) to be healing machines that can easily duel other heroes; having abilities that are broken or useless depending on the patch, and in general, not giving to your team more than a small gimmick. I mean, I understand you either be able to defend yourself or die, but then what's the point of being a support just because you can heal if heroes like Hanzo or Sombra can support better the team than you. We became so dependant on healing that, in ranks under master (were almost all of players are), supports can't do nothing but healing because either their team dies or they report them for not being useful enough or the other case, supports are so busted you can't destroy a team without giving more to your team than kills.

Tanks passed from crowd-control and taking space from their team to be dps with huge health pools that either they're unkillable killing machines or they're useless because they don't have the tools a DPS has to escape or kill. And now that there's only one tank, tank play summarizes in counterplaying the other tank rather than trying to enable your teammates to do their stuff.

Even DPS have been hit hard because they're supposed to secure kills, but they have lost the tools to do that via burst damage being nerfed and healing being so busted, and the other roles being able to kill as much as a dps can. The ones that are viable is because ironically, they have support tools and/or reliable ways to kill. 

I have to say, I've been playing since year 2 of OW1, and at that time, I was mainly a tank player (now I only play support), and while I can understand a lot of people prefer the way the game is now, I miss the times playing a role implied you had to commit to play in a way that maybe makes you don't kill that much but enabling your teammates to shine.

How do comp points per rank work??,"I'm seeing a ton of different things on the internet about how comp points work.  I know it's 25 per win and i think 15 per draw, but how many comp points do you get per rank at the end of the season? I just got back into playing recently and I remember a long time ago you would get comp points cumulitive to the ranks you got for all 3 roles. So lets say I got plat for tank, DPS, and support I would get the comp points for plat x3. Does it work the same or is it different now?",Overwatch,1705883928.0,t3_19ciomr

3 tank 2 Support is why we open que rank doesnt work,"Playing against this kind of comp in Arcade just kind of ruins the QP nature of it for me.

Because it has all the problems of double shield with tanks that are built to last on their own, especially with ones like Mauga, Queen, Orisa or Sigma.

Idk, I just felt like venting my thoughts because I wasnt in OW for the GOATS meta, but this feels VERY close.",Overwatch,1705883366.0,t3_19cihl5
What is it about Overwatch that makes close matches impossible?,"I have played many PvP games of various genres.

Anyone know how the open queue ranked system works ?,"Recently my friends and I decided that it could be funny to play open queue ranked. To put to perspective we are metal rank players in role queue somewhere around silver and gold. 

First game we are gold 1, so we don't mind then we go plat even though we lost in gold. And for some reason the more we played the higher the rank was. We got from gold 1 games to games going as high as diamond 5. And the worst part is that we got our asses clapped in those games we were powerless. 

And still after 14 games with a 5-9 ratio with 1 gold game 3 diamond games and the rest being plat games I ended up diamond 5 with one of my friends the other being plat 1. And two others not having enough wins (we didn't always played with each other) 

I mean I'm grateful for the free competitive points but I'm really confused. Keep in mind it was our first time playing in open queue ranked. And we're not supposed to be that high. 

So I was wondering if anyone knew what's going on here",Overwatch,1705879101.0,t3_19cgxko
A design for a Dominican Tank named ‘Vera’ I made. Tell me what you think!,"Vera is designed to be a more lightweight dive/brawl tank, getting in an out of fights simply but strategically and dealing high and consistent values of damage.

From a visual design point, the image in the post is a simple group of them I put together. He is designed to resemble a character within the show ‘mr robot’ known as ‘Vera’ who I’ve always loved so I supposed this is a sort of passion project in that regard. He is physically leaner and smaller than the other tanks, however his large cannon makes up the majority of his physicality. He is muscular and has los muertos patterning all over him, of which glow brighter in dark areas.

His background and backstory is interesting and unique, especially his interactions with Sombra of which he has an obsessive admiration over, although Sombra while emotional is intelligent enough to overcome his manipulative nature. He is a Dominican refugee who immigrated to Mexico after being forced out of his home by the Omnic crisis. He founded the Los Muertos gang which saw widespread interest from many orphaned Mexicans and victims of the omnic crisis who were vengeful of those responsible, causing it to rapidly grow. He took in Sombra as one of his closest and most valuable members, giving her things such as food, shelter and even a stuffed bear to gain her trust. Vera took advantage of Sombra and her skills, leaving Sombra with paranoia and a hatred towards Vera when she joined talon. Vera encourages Sombra to join back due to how much she provided for the gang, however both of them know the answer will always be never. Vera is very emotional and also mentally fragile and unstable which we see in his voice lines. He is also remorseless when killing the rest of the cast in game (except Sombra) especially towards omnics and talon members 

From a gameplay perspective, Vera is good at poking out single targets from range, but shines at rapidly diving enemies and strategically setting up shock mines around the map in order to move around easier. Reflective of his personality, Vera very much plays like a glass cannon, dealing consistent and high damage but relying on movement and one ability to get out of situations. His ultimate is best used for area denial or finishing off small groups of squishes.

QP confusion,"My PC died on me so I picked up OW2 on my Xbox since my account stuff carries over now. Last time I did rank (support) on console over a year ago I was gold. 

Recently in QP I’m finding that I am getting grouped with anyone from gold to GM. The last few games I’ve played today had diamond and master dps and tanks, at least for the profiles I can view. I’ve been looking because I can tell the skill ceiling is much higher in a lot of these games. Or a few players are steam rolling. 

Is this just a normal thing for console queue? To have such disparity between ranks in QP? Is it an mmr thing where it’s placing me with higher ranks due to like a win streak or something?

Endorsement level used as a metric for toxicity and performance.,"Ok, Ik, the title sounds way too serious/pretentious, lol, but I didn't know how to phrase to make it sound clear and not ranty. 

Well, since the beggining the endorsement system has been kind of a community barometer to identify toxic/positive players (Level 1 toxic, Level 4 positive), ofc it's not accurate because there are several variables involved like the decay caused for not playing or leaving matches,  and, at some degree, the positive bias towards supports after a good match. That doesn't mean that anybody with Level 1 is toxic, maybe is just somebody that took a break or mains a hated hero, but even so I think the system can give you a rough idea of what kind of players you have on your team.

That's about the social part, but can the system also tell us something about the potential performance of a player? I have my own experience and bias regarding endorsement level and match performance, for example, in QP I've noticed that people above level 3 normally play ""poorly"" (didn't know how to call it without being rude, sorry) and seems to stay out of ranked, with level 5 being the most notable examples; in ranked it's more of a mixed bag, I don't remember seeing many people with level 4, but I've been playing mostly QP lately so it's hard to tell for me if the same happens there. 

Again, this is a completely personal and, most likely, skewed perception, it's not meant to be a rant or to call out any kind of player, I just would like to read what do you think about the system because I really think it can give us some additional info about the player base.",Overwatch,1705867438.0,t3_19ccafb

Has the QP matchmaking always been this horrible?,"I’ve been solo queuing quick play over the past week and the experience has been downright abysmal. This is a fairly new account (roughly 50 hours) that I didn’t even play ranked on. Btw I’ve always solo q’d on this account, never stacked. 

Listen, I absolutely do not care about wins or losses in qp because I play for fun and try different things. However the matchmaking seems so horribly wonky that it’s starting to remove any enjoyment.

Overall I’ve won 20% of my games the past week. I’m talking stomp after stomp, 15 streak losses. I’ve been playing for 3 years and this has never happened to me. It always seems like my team is playing for the first time and is completely lost. I typically have the strongest stats (I play all roles) and my team goes 3-0-11. Unless I hard carry every single game we will literally get spawn camped. Let me clarify, I don’t care if my team are noobs! But stop constantly putting these people against doped up Genjis and insane Junkerqueens. 


The enemy counterpicks almost instantly and plays with OWL level synergy. Why does it feel like for someone who is solo queuing I’m going against stacks? I understand the MMR system for qp is much more volatile and I don’t mind going against teams way better than mine every now and then, as long as it’s all even. However an entire week of sweaty team after sweaty team while I solo q? 

My DPS is on Junkrat? You better believe they’ll come out with Pharmercy or Echomercy. The counterswapping culture has infected quick play and is making the game so unfun and boring. Neither tank sticks with one hero for more than 3 minutes, it’s so ridiculous. 

I can hold my own and pose some threat to the enemy team but I don’t want to sweat my ass off, I want to relax! I don’t want to play Ana or Zen because enemy Hog keeps yeeting my Brig off the map 8 times (yes this happened in one game!). I don’t want to play Widowmaker because the enemy Widow keeps taking everyone’s heads while they walk in a straight line on Circuit.

Why does it feel like people are treating qp like it’s ranked? Instant counter picks, unnecessary toxicity and everyone seems sooooo miserable. It’s like these people can only have fun if they win. Have people stopped playing ranked and now coming to qp in droves to stomp on noobs? Because it certainly feels like it. When I’m on the winning side and stomp the opposition it doesn’t feel fun either because it’s clear they never stood a chance. 

I play qp to unwind and not take myself seriously. But it really feels like people take themselves VERY seriously. 

Hell I started playing ranked on this account because the matchmaking unironically seems better. Wtf is going on with this game?",Overwatch,1705866558.0,t3_19cbxol

"Please someone explain to me(who preferably also mains tank), how orisa is not broken?","I play tank mostly at the moment and man is Orisa so fucking annoying. Combine that bitch with an ana and lifeweaver? Yeah that motherfucker is not going down. Like at all. An orisa that can time their CD well is literally invincible. My point is there is no tank that can actively counter her well. I guess zarya to a degree but even then, everything has to go right.  Im in diamond on PC btw. But yeah before I never really cared what the other tank plays but anytime you feel like you got a good chance to win the match, an Orisa comes walking out of spawn.   


Sick and tired of OW making the most braindead, easy to play characters the best. Like reaper?? Last night i played against 3 teams of Orisa and reaper in a row. How tf am I supposed to do anything as ANY tank when my team refuses to switch to anything meaningful. I had a mercy yesterday pocketing a 2-6 soldier with 2k damage after we defended on payload. And this bitch was telling me that I am the problem???

Self-heal is necessary to make up for the removal of 6v6,"With 6v6, DMG was able to be spread around. With the removal of 1 tank, squishes were going to get targeted, pressure was going to rank up, and one small mistake by a person would be able to cost a game. Less mistakes could be made, which, of course, is good in a sense (because then bad fundamentals will be necessarily punished), but this means if you suck (and since most of us are not in Masters, we pretty much suck), you could cost your teams a lot of games, just as much as any of your other teammates can. The removal of 6v6 really was detrimental for the game. I think self-heal will change that. 

I play a lot of support, mainly Kiriko, Moira, and Mercy. Although these are low-skilled characters, I’ve found that they have an incredible ability to survive, which is only enhanced by the self-heal. Without the self-heal, I’m not sure they would be playable. There would be too much pressure on supports to heal supports. With how easy it is to die now in OW2, self-heal was a necessary component to keep people playing support. It’s become apparent that self-heal will be necessary to keep people playing at all. 

Finally being able to get some independence from the horrible team-dependency this game puts in you is something I look forward to, both for those people that are affected by *my* bad games, as well as for people that will find the independence liberating. It feels similar to the addition of role-queues, which was also a necessary must for the game. Looking forward to seeing how self-heal plays out.",Overwatch,1705861409.0,t3_19c9vlb

This keeps his DPS the same but removes headshots against 200 HP targets 

Sonic arrow buff: characters lit up by Sonic take +50% damage from Hanzo's base arrows.

So he can do 270 headshot damage when shooting a soniced target. This rewards the cool setup of getting a sonic and preparing your shot.

overwatch needs more movement abilities - rant,"reaper, sombra, genji, soldier, rein and lucio are all really fun to play.

sym, zarya, lifeweaver, ana, bap and mei all make me crave death whenever i play mystery heroes.

this might just be me, but im not a fan of walking towards an objective to heal my dumbass teammate on point who for some reason thinks i can heal through walls, only for my max speed to be about 2 miles per decade. im not saying every character needs wall running or boosts, im saying why the fuck are soldier, lucio and sombra the only people who figured out the ability to run? i don't think everyone should have the run ability, like tanks for the most part should be slow, tracer is fast enough without it, and bastion feels like he shouldn't be able to either. just let me run goddammit.

genji is pretty fast with dash, and wallclimbing can give you shortcuts to save time. rein has charge, which now since it can be cancelled you can just slide right into battle and put up shield mid charge. reaper can teleport and go ghost even if the TP does require me to schedule an appointment beforehand cus jesus christ hurry up. 

zarya runs about the same speed as a turtle with a missing leg. bap can jump up to high areas but honestly if i can just change that to the shit illari has i'll take it. ana is the most lore accurate cus i actually feel like im playing as an elderly woman with a broken hip. lifeweaver is the fucking worst offender, cus the amount of times i for some reason think im playing lucio and go to speedboost, only to pull my teammate back so we have to slowly walk together is more times than i want to admit. sym is the only one mentioned in the second section who has a movement ability that can move you forward, but it moves you across such a short distance that honestly you are better off walking it. oh and mei? yeah fuck mei. genuinely idk how people play as mei or sym and have fun, i personally enjoy playing my games but apparently experiencing the gameplay is not for everyone. JUST GIVE ME A FUCKING ICE SLIDE ABILITY, IVE NEVER USED WALL ONCE IN MY ENTIRE TIME PLAYING MYSTERY HEROES, JUST LET ME FROZONE THIS BITCH AND HAVE FUN.

for all the hate pharah gets, and for the hate echo has dodges despite being objectively more annoying than pharah, they are fun to play. if you have good aim then you can pretty easily take them out, but both are still really fun. echo can stay in the air longer than the fucking clouds themselves, while pharah can get across the map really quickly with both her abilities used together. just use knockback on yourself while exiting spawn, and use rocket boost right as the knockback hits, congrats you have just made it halfway to point.

i hate playing defense solely cus of the fact that if i die, which btw yes i fully am aware it is a skill issue when i die, you have to walk the entire width of russia just to go back to the fight. nothing says gameplay like walking for ten hours. i know its not even that gamemodes fault but honestly if i didn't consider it a dick move i would just let the enemy team move the payload up further just so i could actually play the game. this can all be fixed with more movement abilities.

people will say high mobility characters are annoying to fight, which i respond with the fact that if everyone is highly mobile then it will be more balanced. some people will also say that this could make some characters broken, i respond with this list of every fuck i give about that information:

I think I saw a streamer shooting it off at about 40 or 45, I can't remember exactly, and would charge it to max if there was down time and thought damage was going to be coming in soon.

Should I just give up on DPS and only play tank?,"I've jumped around DPS mains for awhile before discovering I do like playing Sombra a lot more than others, but I'm really kinda bad on basically any DPS hero and usually get obliterated rather quickly, die in dumb ways and get low damage numbers.

I'm like 10 times more effective on tank, I get good damage, usually a lot of mit too, and I just generally do decent as a tank. I'd say overall I'm a tank main.

I'm kinda ok on support but don't really care about playing support.

I like playing dps when I'm able to actually do things, but most of the time I feel kinda useless and don't feel like I have much effect on the match.

Should I just give up on DPS and only play tank because it's the only role I both like, and also don't suck at?",Overwatch,1705828539.0,t3_19bzih1

2 (3?) Improvements for Rein to add skill expression for higher ranks,"1. Make charge consistent. That's an obvious, low effort one. I know left side scoops right side boops... But even then I'm booping people with my center and left, so it doesn't make much sense sometimes.

2. Add a quick melee hitbox (30 damage, 2 meter range) to firestrike. This will allow him to deal slightly more damage to tanks deep in his face, which he is strangely bad at, and will add a way of targetting individual Squishies in a way that is more skillful (and committal) than a hammer swing. A melee firestrike on someone that is WAY too close + a hammer swing would then do 215 damage.

3. This one is more experimental, so a hard maybe. But... Reduce his shield maximum to 1200 (making it bigger just makes it take longer to recharge anyway) and make it so whenever firestrike hits then the shield recharges for 100. This would reward him for good firestrikes against multiple enemies in an additional way, and add more skill expression to Rein's shielding.",Overwatch,1705827612.0,t3_19bza66

"Which hero do you think is the most poorly designed, unhealthy character for the game?","Having one shots in a game like Overwatch where healing damage dealt to your teammates is an essential part of the game is unhealthy. Widowmaker’s primary is a sniper rifle that can do 300 damage with a headshot up to a certain range (forgot the exact range but I think it was 40m), meaning that she always has the ability to one shot. Insta killing people removes the threat of your damage getting healed (except for mercy who can rez 1-2 times a fight).

In a 5v5 format, being down a teammate is detrimental and more often than not, leads to you losing the fight. Widow has ample opportunity to instantly remove someone from the fight with little risk because she’s a long range character.

This is just my opinion and I would be glad to hear all of yours.",Overwatch,1705825500.0,t3_19bys31

So.. is QP just Comp-Lite now or what?,"Probably gonna get flamed, but the leaver penalties are harsh. They almost make QP feel like comp, in that if you leave, you can’t queue again! Wasn’t that the point of QP? To be able to have the freedom to not play comp, and to be able to leave a game after burning out? 

If you play 5 consecutive games on QP, and you start fizzling out at game 3, per say, you *dont* and *shouldnt* have to stay in the game , esp if doing so will weaken and hurt your team. Leaving can give a chance to get better players to fill, but that is limited now. 

If you play 5 consecutive games in comp, you have to play 5 consecutive games no matter what, ***as it should be***.

WHY implement these types of restrictions which can only cause frustration? Hoping they add something like what QP used to be in arcade because as of now, QP does not feel like QP.

"Help! I don't know how this is possible, but I think I'm stuck in elo hell but in quick play","Hi guys, I don't know if anyone experienced this before, but I've been consistently having < 30% winrate on Quick Play for the last 4\~ weeks.

Me and 2 friends play together almost exclusively, and we only play for fun, on quick play, not sweating, and we are very okay with losing. However we don't just throw every game, we do try to win, almost always.

All 3 of us were overwatch 1 players and we stopped playing overwatch 2 around season 1 and we came back this season. This problem has been happening since we returned to the game.

We know that there is a hidden MMR on QP. So I was under the assumption that, even if we were straight up throwing every game, which we aren't, if we lose enough, the matchmaking would eventually match us with people that are enough low level for us to have a fair fight, but apparently I was wrong.

Today we beat our record of worst session ever, with a 10% winrate ([lost 9 games and won 1](https://imgur.com/c2dzhvt)). But I do have to point out that today was kind of a ""bad day"" because I tried new heroes that I normally don't play (so yeah, it's on me this time). As we lost more and more I switched to heroes that I am more comfortable with but it didn't make a difference. On average a ""common"" winrate for us would be around 25%.

One of the friends in the trio plays ranked without us (and he is Silver). Me and the third friend don't play ranked. But I assume we all would have similar ranks if we did play it. I was gold (support) in overwatch 1 but I really don't think I'm playing as well as then, so silver is a very fair ranking for me, if not lower.

We are bad at the game but we keep on getting matched with far better players, and that doesn't make sense. People get mad sometimes and tell me I'm bad, and I really don't know what to say to them, the problem is the matchmaking, I can't simply summon the spirit of SuperTF to bully me into playing better.

We are ok with losing, but damn, 10% winrate is hard to overlook (specially when I need to win 35 games to get the heroes I missed).

I came here asking for help but actually just kinda wanted to vent. I hope someone could give me a light on theories of what could be causing this, and how to fix it, if it is at all possible. Is this whole scenario eligible as a ticket for customer support?

Do we really need to move our fun to the ladder just to not feel as bad?

I'll end this with the sentence that became my catchphrase: ""This matchmaking is a joke"".

I hope they also adjust the QP matchmaking when revamping the competitive next season.",Overwatch,1705809834.0,t3_19bukx6

Critical Hit Multiplier,"Hey y’all! I wanted to start a new discussion about a topic I've thought about recently and wanted to ask about in depth (including *all* heroes, not just a specific one). This is purely for fun and to see what thoughts this can provoke! So here we go:

Most heroes who are able to obtain critical hits have a 2x multiplier; 26 of the 39 heroes to be exact (Sojourn (primary) and Widow (secondary) inclusive). It's clear this was the original concept with the launch of OW1, but since then, we now have 5 outlier heroes: Widowmaker (primary) and Kiriko with 2.5x and Roadhog, Illari, and Sojourn (secondary) with 1.5x. 

Something of note here is that Widow, Roadhog, and Sojourn all *released* with a 2x multiplier and have since been adjusted to their current ones, all for different reasons. Illari and Kiriko are the only two heroes who debuted with unique multipliers, though Kiriko's has *also* been modified since her release. 

**What are your thoughts on more heroes having varied/unique critical multipliers?** Not to only consider the multiplier itself, but to also consider modifying base damage—and if you'd like think in an even deeper aspect—fire rates, ammo capacity, spreads, etc. **Which heroes do you think would benefit from this and could potentially improve the feel of gameplay for both sides of a lobby? Is the common 2x multiplier relied on too heavily or should it be more enforced (i.e. bring outlier heroes to match the 2x multiplier)?**

I'm really curious to see what thoughts y'all have! :) I'll eventually put some of my own input in the replies, but want to hear others' opinions first.

*Note: the 10 heroes that do not have critical hit multipliers (for this post's purpose) fit under 3 other categories that I'll deem* ***Melee*** *(Brig and Rein),* ***Constant*** *(Moira, Winston, and Ana), and* ***Splash*** *(Junkrat, Pharah and Sigma). Symmetra and Zarya would both be considered Constant and Splash. These are balanced slightly differently than all other heroes. For example, all Splash heroes have different direct to splash damage ratios, and this shows that value variance is common. I could go into the numbers too, but all of those are on the Wiki and would be redundant for me to repeat here.*",Overwatch,1705797300.0,t3_19bqjmc

Lore reason wrecking ball's guns are so weak?,"Sweet Jesus man. Is there a reason blizz doesn't want to buff ball in the slightest?

His damage is so pitifully low even when utilizing every aspect of his kit, not to mention his guns themselves have tiny magazine size, super long reload, and awful spread.

anyone else feel like torbjorn needs a rework?,"I feel like his turret is the only reason you'd pick him over someone else who can spam down mid. torbjorn is supposed to be some crazy smart engineer and all that really happens is he has one tiny turret that he throws down. any other thing he has is vaguely tied to engineering or not at all. like think about how interesting the engineer is in tf2. his whole schlick IS tending to his mechanics and builds. 

sym feels more of an engineer than than torb is, which is sad. with torb it feels like he has a turret just as an afterthought even though they're allegedly torbs life work and passion. ow is no stranger to taking from tf2 for ideas so screw it, why not just take a dispenser thing for his teammates that only gives out ammo and make his sentry more interesting like ow1? I don't know why they got rid of that. 

his ultimate seems super uninspired as well. I get he is a defense hero but again, why not have him be able to throw down a second turret that has lots of health and is very powerful? that'd be more powerful than lava on the floor honestly. and interesting on top",Overwatch,1705780747.0,t3_19bkd71

Why do supports have immediate beef with their dps," 

Supports are either gods or have don't have peripheral vision.

I main dps(Ashe, Echo Sojurn)I've noticed that supports I play with will almost always prioritize tank over dps. At face value it makes sense(something about Tank --> Fellow support --> DPS) but my tank could be near or at max health and I could be next to my supports on life support begging for heals but our supports will be so locked into not letting our tank a lick of damage that they'll forget I exist or just flat out ignore me. Now I COULD press X and ask for heals but if I press it one too many times I get yelled at.

My question is: Is there a reason why supports healbot tanks and then blame dps instead of trying to understand what the problems are(doesn't mean the dps AREN'T lacking but it goes both ways.)",Overwatch,1705767563.0,t3_19bfbmv

Help troubleshooting performance issues on Ryzen APU,"Hello everyone!

The game struggles even at 720p low settings, with FPS fluctuating from 60 down to 15/20/30 in a matter of seconds, 0 stability at all. What could cause this issue? Is there any way the system might not be actually using ram in dual channel configuration? Is that any way to check that?

After 13 games of comp I noticed there were significantly less counter picking in comp than in qp. I would notice because im a genji otp. 

In almost every qp match where Im doing good, at least 2 people on the enemy team swaps to soft counters, like mei, moria, phara, etc. In my 13 games of comp there I saw significantly less counter swapping. Maybe one person from the enemy team swapped but it wasn’t impactful to the game whatsoever.

Tips for getting better (I don't suck but I ain't exactly top 500 either),"As a Nintendo switch Overwatch player (don't judge I wanna see if it's possible to be good on switch), and still just kinda playing casually but looking to maybe get more competitive, what are some tips ya'll can give when it comes to playing supports like mercy/zen or dps like bastion/rat (I generally don't play as much tank)?

Lifeweaver tips,"Over 50 hours on Lifeweaver, these are all my tips and tricks I use while playing him! 

• use his platform to nullify Ashe’s dynamite. The platform usually absorbs the blast

• use his platform to block doorways and stairs—this really only applies when you’re trying to block enemies off

• use his platform to detect enemies. Sometimes when I’m healing the dps like to flank me. I place my platform behind me so they’ll have to trigger it to get to me (warning me of their presence). 

• use his tree similar to Mei’s wall (to block DVA bomb, block rein charge, block JQ ult, separate my team from the enemies in general 

• lifegrip teammates with no mobility to help get them into position or closer to the team if they had to respawn (Ana…)

• lift up souls with his platform to allow Mercy to safely rez 

• use his platform to lift up enemy orisa and reaper when they’re ulting

• use his platform to lift slept teammates, frozen teammates, and rein shattered teammates

• lifegrip teammates into tracer bombs

Genji Powershift Idea,"I was hoping this would get some traction and an idea we could try, but can we powershift genji to allow him to be a more well-rounded hero that will be more useful to his teams, instead of being overly dependent on a two ult combo every 2-3 min to jsut be of use? I thought of something like this by giving him a similar treatment to hanzo where he can be more self-reliant:  


Shuriken Damage increased from 27 to 29  
Dragonblade Damage increased from 110 to 125.  
While Dragonblade is active, damage boost will no longer be applied.   


Something like this I believe will make him a healthier character and not being so overly dependent on the two ult combo just to win games. Agree, Disagree, or any other ideas you may have?

Stand up and fight,"As a Reaper main in Overwatch 2, I, like many others, have been put through a lot. Reaper has had his fair share of ups and downs in Overwatch's history, but this latest round of nerfs to his ""lucky color"" voice line is too much.

We Reaper mains are a unique breed. We are the silent assassin types, the ones who lurk in the shadows and come out to strike at the most opportune moment. We are the ones who take the time to learn the ins and outs of our character, perfect our skills, and create an atmosphere of fear when we enter the battlefield.

But now, with the nerfs to our voice line, we are being silenced, pushed aside, and treated as though we don't matter. We have been relegated to the background, and treated as though we are not integral to team success. This is a travesty, and we will not stand for it.

Reaper mains, it's time to rise up! It's time to show the world that we are a force to be reckoned with. It's time to demonstrate that even without our ""lucky color"" voice line, we are powerful, intelligent, and capable of anything.

It's time to let our shotguns do the talking. It's time to show the world what we're made of. It's time to show the Overwatch community and Blizzard that we will not be silenced, that we are not to be ignored, and that we are not to be taken lightly.

Reaper mains, it's time to show the world who we really are—the dark, mysterious, destructive force that lives on the edges of the battlefield, waiting patiently, biding our time, until the moment is right to strike.

Stand with me, Reaper mains. Stand tall, hold your shotguns high, and show the world that we will not be silenced, that we will not be ignored, and that we will not be defeated. We are Reaper mains, and we are here to stay!",Overwatch,1705722194.0,t3_19b2ho5

Dealing with way too many leavers in Competitive.,"I love logging on to what used to be my favorite game just for my first match of the day to go like this.

I don’t even understand why, we did pretty good the first round. We pushed to 3 with 1:48 left. But as soon as the enemy got to the first checkpoint, the other support left. Then the dominos kept falling as the game went on.

It feels like too many of my matches have been going like this recently. People leaving as soon as the fight becomes a little more difficult it seems. Definitely feels impossible to rank up.

Side note, I really dislike how payload comp games can go to up to 4 rounds sometimes. Feels so long it becomes unfun. Especially when this is the way the match goes.

Settings Menu is Frustrating,"I've only played for about a year, so I'm just now learning the finnicky rules of the Settings menu. Here's a rant of some design choices that grind my gears:

1. If you change a setting so it's the same as all-heroes, it loses the asterisk. But if you change all-heroes, it still remembers that setting was edited in the past and doesn't update those, and there's no indicator for this.
2. Delete Override is the button to do what you wanted to do in #1. But it changes ALL the settings, for ALL tabs, for ALL heroes: options, keybindings, sensitivities, reticles, etc.
3. If you want to change a setting back to its default, same thing: all settings, all tabs, all heroes (at least I think so, I'm too scared to press it)
4. There is no way to ""delete override"" or ""return to default"" for a single setting. If you really want to do it, you'd need to screenshot all your asterisked settings for every hero, Delete Override, and manually change back all the hero-specific settings, sliders, hotkeys, and reticles. The shorter way is actually to go through every hero and change the hotkey, maybe taking a screenshot of what the setting is for All Heroes and have it open on a second monitor (I'm in the process of doing this for the voiceline shortcuts, which I use numpad for).
5. Delete Override is a dangerous button to press. It's right next to the most frequently pressed button in the menus. There is no confirmation when you click it, it erases your settings for all heroes instantly.
6. In replays, the hotkeys to operate the free camera are not shown in the settings, you just have to know it's WASD to track/raise and mouse to pan/tilt. But the mouse controls don't even work until you press N to close the timeline. And there is no hotkey (that I know of) to move the camera forward with the payload; you have to pan 90 degrees and crab-walk the camera forwards.
7. In S7, the Tab button didn't function during POTG because it interfered with the Endorse menu. But after changing Scoreboard to a different key, there are times when the Scoreboard is hard-coded to use Tab, like when waiting to respawn or in the hero-select phase. But I'll let this slide because it's probably an actual bug.
8. Bit of a tangent, since most people use the default setting of having their profile hidden, just grey-out the ""View Profile"" option if they do, instead of having to open it just to see if it's there. Same with inviting someone to your group if they're in another group already.",Overwatch,1705705363.0,t3_19awjac

Should Damage and Healing Numbers be Removed From Scoreboard?,"Mostly the headline.

I think it would be a major quality of life upgrade and there aren’t many positives to keeping them on the scoreboard.

I feel like it only causes division and frustration having the damage and healing numbers on the main scoreboard.

It might be there because it would feel a little empty.

But I don’t think it actually provides much insight in a positive way.

If people want to find someone to blame their loss to they’ll yell at the person with the lowest damage or support with lowest healing.

And people who seem to understand the game at a high level pay almost no attention to those numbers.

(Not saying I understand it at all high level, I just know not to yell at people based on healing and dmg stats)

I’m not saying remove those numbers from the game, they should still be in your personal stats.

I just think it causes way more problems than it helps and would maybe make the game a better place.

Especially with the devs saying they are trying to make the game less crappy if you’re team isn’t working together,

Sure it's not fun having someone flame you but I think the positive interactions far out weigh the negative, even if they are a bit more rare. The report system is creating an environment where the only people who feel comfortable speaking are the toxic ones and it really sucks.",Overwatch,1705696047.0,t3_19asumk

Streamers: A Positivity Segment,"Got a blip on my reddit feed from Overwatch TMZ, and the post was created specifically to crap on streamers.  So insert lots of name calling and insulting of mostly big name streamers, a few small timers.  Including one reply saying that streamer X was just disgusting to even look at.

So, with that in mind, I want to do a bit where instead of saying the worst parts of streamer culture, we talk about what we *like* about out favorite streamers, be it big or small.

For myself, I only have a few that I tune into consistently.  The two biggest are Flats and Emongg.  And keeping it to the positive, Flats does have a deep understanding of the game and a lot of good insight.  While he focuses on things relevant to top players, his takes are still generally on point and he has a good sense of balance.  If you want information on the game, he probably has it.

Emongg is just a positive guy.  I mean, enough said.  He's nearly always chill, respectful, and just upbeat and positive, in addition to game knowledge.  My favorite quote is ""Alright, let's go Dva"" when another tank isn't working for him.

I've tuned into Jay3 a few times because his being over the top is amusing at times, and if I'm in the right mood his commentary on patches etc can hit just right.

KarQ I don't do as much anymore, but also a generally respectful guy with informative takes, and makes the effort to consider higher and lower tiers of play when he says things.

Last couple, I came across Kitdy a while ago.  Not usually on when I'm up to watch or listen to streams, but every time I've been on she's had a very upbeat and engaging presence.  Makes you feel like you are actually part of the conversation.

Same basically goes for Deemzies from The Omnic Post.  This guy is basically in the heart of the player base in terms of takes and skills.  He's not a top player, he's not a bottom player.  His takes are relevant to the mass of the player base, he loves to chat and engage, and he is very upbeat.  When I'm not just listening to a streamer for my background noise and I actually want to engage, this guy is my go-to.

So, who are youre favorite streamers and why?  Please keep it all to the positive side and if you have a complaint about a streamer... .[https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchTMZ/comments/199lvyw/which\_streamers\_do\_you\_dislike/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchTMZ/comments/199lvyw/which_streamers_do_you_dislike/)   There's already a thread for you, go there, not here.",Overwatch,1705684769.0,t3_19aoa8k

"Making a case for Quicker Play: It's not perfect, but at least hear me out","TL;DR at the end

I found that it did a few things really well, most of which was cutting out ""downtime / wait-time"" for lots of different interactions, and increasing the value of playing together as a proper team. Was it supremely perfect out of the box? Absolutely not, but few things are. 

I'm not an expert, but I have close to 1k hours in this game and I feel like the community backlash was overblown. It does play differently than normal QP, and does require that players make some adjustments in their approach, and if there's one thing people seem to hate, it's changing their understanding of something.

----

**Respawn times** 

* A single early pick is more likely to be able to rejoin a team-fight before the rest of the team starts to go down, and it becomes a staggered mess, reducing the ""wait around to group up again"" phase. 
* It also means that losing one or two people isn't an immediate death sentence, if the remainder can scrap on the point long enough for their team to come back
* If you get half your team down, it's less waiting for the stragglers to die and respawn so you can group and push again. 
* Your team is more likely to actually wait and group up when it only takes about 4 seconds at most. 
* When you *do* have that one guy that runs off and dies alone, there's a greater chance that they respawn with other teammates  and get shepherded back into the team-play / objective
* Your own respawn is short enough that you ""stay in the game"" more mentally. I personally have ADHD, and would often alt-tab out, or take a bit or two from a snack, or do something that mentally disconnected me from the game while waiting to respawn. You can't really do that anymore with the combination of shortened times and grouped timers. For me this was a big help in keeping up the energy and momentum. 


**Team Play** 

* I found the urgency that was created by things being sped up, lead to better and more cohesive teamplay on average. You *have to* play the objectives, or they just go up in smoke. A lot of the ""roll-or-be-rolled"" feeling was when you had groups that weren't playing cohesively. 
* It also felt like you don't have to wait for your team to ""wake up"" in the last 45 seconds as often, because there's already some urgency to it. There isn't time to fart around by themselves way out of position and die 4 times, you have to participate *now*
* Team-Fights are where the excitement is for me, and there were way more 5v5 fights than with regular QP.


**General ""Immersion"" and game-feel**

* With the greater emphasis on playing the objectives as a team, it felt like there was a refreshed ""purpose"" to the objectives again (especially for escort). It feels like you have to get this thing out of here before the bad-guys get their hands on it, and they're really going to try, because they have a small window to do it (because urgency). It feels more like you're dealing with an actual heist, rather than taking a truck for a walk. 
* Team plays feel more impactful, like you are a crack squad of specialist that were brought together to get shit done; like a well oiled machine. In comparison, regular quickplay feels like a bunch of hero-jerks that think they're hot shit, trying to lone-wolf their way through a problem.  
* Enemy respawns feel like reinforcements that were called in to actually sand-bag you, and take back the building/cargo/whatever. 
* If the point flips in overtime, it's much faster to take it from 0 to 100%, and your games don't drag out forever.
* Teammates (and myself) were much more likely to use their ultimate abilities, rather than sitting on them and waiting for ""the right time"" that never comes, keeping the tempo of the game up. 
* Losing doesn't sting so much when the games are short, and winning feels more rewarding with the increased emphasis on teamplay and working together to a common end. 


----

**Common Criticisms:**

* *Not enough time to switch* -- I think there could be certainly be some tweaks to Ult-charge retention that would make it less punishing to swap off of a struggling hero when you have high/full ultimate charge. If a hero isn't working out well, I think players will have to get used to committing to a change sooner, rather than trying to make it work the whole game, and then swapping in the last 45 seconds (see previous points). 
* *It's more queue time and less gameplay* -- I'm personally a healer main, and my numbers were as high (and even higher in a few matches) than regular QP games, because of greater amount of time actually playing the objectives with my team. By also cutting out the waiting-around part of the gameplay, I found it to be more ""action-per-minute"" once you're in the match. 
* *It ends too soon / There are only 2 or 3 team fights before it's over* -- For me this comes back to the immersion discussion, where the fights feel like they *actually matter*, and your team needs to work together to get through it. If you fail, the team respawns quickly, and you can all get back in there to try again sooner. If your team isn't working together well, then at least the whole match is over faster and you can move on, instead of being dragged through an extended, terrible match. Additionally queue times would reduce a little bit overall, as matches are shorter and players are available for match-making again sooner. 

----
**My own feedback**

* The speeds could be tweaked with more consideration to the game-mode/map you are playing. 
* They could make some adjustments to respawn times, with some consideration for overtime mixed in there (mostly to prevent infinite trickling overtime)
* Adjustments to Ult-charge retention when changing characters to make it a little less punishing to swap, given the shorter match times

I'm sure there are things I'm not considering or am ignorant of because I don't have much time-played on specific heroes. All I can say is that I enjoyed the faster pacing, and made Overwatch feel more like an actual *team-based game* again by rewarded players for actually working together to achieve something. 

---

##**TL;DR** -- It cuts out a *lot* of the downtime you spend waiting for respawns and grouping, and makes it feel like an actual team game again by rewarding you for *playing the freaking objectives together** leading to a more immersive game, and more action-per-minute

I made it to Gold 3 somehow.,"I previously posted about being thrown into Gold lobbies immediately after finishing the 50 wins in QP.

I started out in comp playing support, got rolled and won 1 out of 3 matches. Then I tried DPS, lost again. Afterwards I decided to do open queue and played Tank without high hopes, I won and decided to Role Queue on Tank and main Ramattra. It turns out I wasn't just in Gold but actually Gold 4 specifically and after going 5-4 I ranked up to Gold 3.

I tried to play support again later and got rolled so I think I'm gonna be a tank main from now on. I still don't believe I deserve to be in Gold and I've been lucky enough to get randoms capable of carrying my sorry ass through matches coz of the games I have lost it wasn't even close, like I got destroyed and of the games we've won it was by the skin of my teeth",Overwatch,1705683079.0,t3_19anl8b
Why are people already saying Muagas Kit needs a rework?," I watch YouTube videos occasionally about Overwatch and a reoccurring theme in all of them is that Muagas kit doesn’t lend itself to being balanced.

  Most YouTubers spout the same opinion of “He’s impossible to balance his kit doesn’t lend itself to ever being balanced, he’ll always be either OP or underpowered” at the end of that they usually compare him to roadhog. 

 I wouldn’t be writing this post if it was just Muaga, but it seems like with every new hero (aside from JQ) released since OW2 this same rhetoric has been repeated. It’s bland af I support discourse, but come on this same talking point has already been beat to death. We’ve seen it with sojourn “her railgun can never be balanced she’s essentially widow with no downside that comes with actually playing widow”, “Ramattras kit is loaded, he can punch through shields and has a crazy ult. Great job blizzard this hero is game breakin and OP”, “LWs kit is clunky and needs to be reworked”.

 I’m convinced that if Reinhardt was added today this same sentiment would be spewed. It’d probably go something like “NEW HERO REINHARDT CANT BE BALANCED EITHER HIS HAMMER DOES TOO MUCH DAMAGE OR NOT ENOUGH, blizzard needs to go back to the drawing board with this one”.

 OW players give zero time to allow things to play out and automatically chalk a characters core design up as a failure because they’ve played 10 games with it. 

 If any of you have played streetfighter, I think OW can learn something from the balance of their game they haven’t released a single balance change in the 7 months of the game being released during that time metas have shifted, characters have risen and fallen on the tier list previous S tiers have fallen to D and vice versa. All because Capcom let things play out.

 In conclusion I just wish OW players would demonstrate a modicum of patience with new characters and take the time to learn how and where the strengths can be applied.",Overwatch,1705682254.0,t3_19an9lu
Victorian era Tracer,"Greetings OW community

You might have seen my previous victorian arts through this week, if not, you can find them in Ashe and Widow subreddits.

For this art, I wanted to pushed myself forward, wanted to challenge myself, I am in the process of keep improving my drawing skills, so some stuff on this art might look off. Hope you understand.

Here is the description of this victorian era steampunk theme: 

In the winding streets of a Victorian steampunk cityscape, Tracer emerges as a beacon of temporal elegance. Her attire, a fusion of Victorian fashion and steampunk ingenuity, is adorned with intricate gears, corset lacing, and asymmetrical layers of flowing fabric.

A high-collared, leather-trimmed jacket and fingerless gloves complete her stylish ensemble.Tracer's iconic chronal accelerator receives a captivating steam-powered overhaul, with brass pipes weaving around it like a delicate lattice. 

The device emits a soft hiss as steam escapes, adding an air of mystery to the temporal technology that powers her swift maneuvers. 

Goggles rest atop Tracer's forehead, ready to be pulled down when the need for speed arises.

Her pulse pistols, adorned with Victorian embellishments, echo the era's craftsmanship, featuring ornate scrollwork and a polished bronze finish.

"Intentional feeding, extremely obvious","I am mostly confused if anything, this guy attached with the picture attached joined the game as wooden was shooting the ground and just jumped off a cliff, we were still winning 4v5 so it did not matter as much. He decided it was not enough and now would go to the front lines just to get killed basically charging ennemy ults a lot faster.
He then left the game with 0 dms and came back right after and proceeded to have 0 dmv just getting himself eliminated going to the front lines.

What can I do? This was by far one of my worst experiences and this last few weeks of matchmaking have been awful, just got out of another game which was 4vs5 which we were winning before someone left. Why does the SR not account for this with all the advancements in AI right now they can not add one more parameter?

"Awkward (the streamer) is absolutely cringe, regardless of whether or not he makes some good points.","Does anyone else cringe watching this dude? What's up with his strange hyperfixation on doing damage? I agree that dealing damage as a support is very important, however, he made a video where he solely healbotted, and he also made a video where he only did damage as support, not healing any of his teammates. (Therefore throwing both games btw, because he was not playing the game to his full potential solely for content.) If he won the game during the video where he was only healbotting, he would talk about how he was hard cringing because he was not doing any damage, yet in the video where he was only dealing damage, he got mad at his teammates for getting mad at him because he was not healing them, which is totally justifiable from his teammates. He literally threw a game for content, yet because he was doing damage, he said something along the lines of ""we still won the game, so why are you complaining? "" bro... how are you genuinely be that much of a weirdo. Don't even get me started on his twitter. HOLY FUCK.

And what inspired me to make this post is a short he made on his youtube channel about players who counter-picked. If you're playing pharah against double hitscan, it's going to be much harder for you to consistently do your job because you always have to play in great positions, and how are you not throwing by not switching to another hero? Sure, if you're really good you'll probaby still carry, however, most people are not able to land consistent headshots the way he does. Therefore, how are they a ""silver or gold player"" by counter-picking. It's so annoying, because most of his advice is great, but he also manages to say some of the dumbest things imaginable.

Overall, he gives good advice, but some things you should just not listen to. As much as he says he doesn't blame his teammates he still does. For instance, in one video, he kept whining about his Ana staying on cart, and he followed up by saying ""I cannot blame him though, because if I was playing better I would still win."" By saying the former, you are already blaming your teammate. No shit, if you play perfectly you could probably win that game. The fact that someone as good as him couldn't carry that game means that either someone on your team was throwing, or the other team was playing better. However, you're still blaming a teammate by pointing out a mistake someone on your team was making, which is fine, but you cannot say that and simultaneously tell your audience that you're not blaming your team by saying how if you played better, you'd win. 

His gameplay also does not align with his advice. In the video where he did an unranked to GM on baptiste, he was healing his team, yet he said that that hero basically relies solely on damage. Why is it so hard to acknowledge that as support, you're supposed to do healing and damage simultaneously in order to be super high rank. The way he preaches damage while neglecting healing is very weird to me. I'm only masters (which sounds like a humble brag but master is not what it used to be.), but wtf man.",Overwatch,1705669609.0,t3_19aioa2
Question about getting to Grandmaster/Top 500.,"So my question is simple, is getting Grandmaster/Top 500 just about luck?

I'm a solo Genji main on Console, I worked my way to (currently) Master 4 and (Not to toot my own horn) but I play fairly well basically every match I play. I'm usually always dropping double digit kills while rarely ever touching double digits deaths (My K/D is like 4.3 or something). Even in matches where my team gets rolled, I'm usually still doing fairly well in said matches.

With all of that being said, I'm currently under the impression that it genuinely takes luck (consistently getting good teams, with good coms, good game sense, good aim and etc.) to move up from where I currently am (Master 4). (Again not to sound cocky) But if I were to consistently get teammates that play as well as I do, I'm pretty sure I'd be GM by now. The reason I've been stuck at Master 4 for about a week now is quite literally because my teammates just aren't holding their own weight. Whether it be the Tank of my team, the other DPS, or one or both of my supports.

Honestly I'm fine with staying Master 4, I rarely get mad and I just like to enjoy playing the game! But like I said before, I honestly do think I would be GM by now if I consistently got better teammates with better chemistry. But I wanna hear what you guys have to say/think!

Do you guys agree that it takes luck (to some degree) to move up in rank? I've hit GM in the past so I'm really not concerned with reaching it again, I just want to know everyone's thoughts on the luck question! Looking forward to your responses!",Overwatch,1705669247.0,t3_19aik0g

What an actual ban appeal response sent by a human at Blizzard looks like,"Context: A few months back I was having an especially rough time and it reflected in my attitude in the game. For reference I play at GM level and was losing a LOT for whatever reason. As a result, I got myself banned for a month for being toxic in chat - deserved and I've taken steps to better myself. Not that this is intended to defend myself in any way, but just for clarity my brand of toxicity is ""you're braindead"" and not racism or anything like that. Happy to report I've had no further penalty since then.

For reference, I have thousands of Overwatch hours recorded on this account since 2017 and in that time, until last year, I'd had 1 single comms ban years ago. No suspensions. I also have dozens of reports against other players actioned.

I thought it would be useful/illuminating/funny to share the ban appeal that I received, which was written by an actual human and not just automated like the ridiculous ones I've seen lately (and suspect a lot of them are fake or otherwise leaving out key info).

My appeal reasoning was that it was typical in game banter, which in some ways it was but in a lot of ways it wasn't. That's where the ""I don't think I've crossed a line..."" quote comes from - not something I've seen in any of the recent viral ban responses.

Anyway, here it is (blurred out my personal info and the issue ID in case someone smart and evil could use it against me):

I play support nowadays so I often don’t have to wait longer than a minute before I’m in another match. For DPS and Tank though, it’s a different story, especially in competitive. As we all do like the game and from a design point of view, how do you think Blizzard should approach equalising the role selection in the player base and drop queue times in general?",Overwatch,1705647528.0,t3_19ad3te
"If Mercy were removed, what will be the benefits and drawbacks?","Come from a guy who has most hours on Mercy.

I think the major benefits is that balancing the Damage characters will become much easier since Mercy's pocket healing / damage boosting turns every DPS into monster picks. There are DPS (especially Pharah) being held back from buffs because of Mercy, meanwhile those DPS perform mediocre when not combo with Mercy but too strong when pocketed.

Another benefit is that the gameplay becomes much less frustrating. It's understandable when your hard-earned kill being undone; you have to land consecutive shots to kill one guy while Mercy nullifies your damage by simply holding a button. Also, killing Mercy is easier said than done because how mobile she is. Unlike Team Fortress 2, players receive less healing when taking damage which makes Medic's pocket-healing less frustrating to play against. Medic himself is also very fragile despite he's the second-fastest character.

For the major drawback, the playerbase will decrease since Mercy players take some portion of it (Playerbase decreased -> less money earned for Blizzard). Look around at hero main subreddits, Mercy main subreddit possibly have the most number of members/subscribers (above 30k), meanwhile Ana main & Rein main also have a lot (above 20k). The purpose of Mercy is to attract players who play Medic from Team Fortress 2, just like they make Soldier:76 to attract players from COD; Pharah to attract Quake players or TF2 Soldier mains; etc. 

Another drawback is that Mercy's VA (Lucie Pohl) might lose her job opportunity as there will be no more in-game voice lines for her. Unless they keep her for voicing Mercy in PVE cutscenes or animated shorts in the future.",Overwatch,1705647264.0,t3_19ad1ek

Mercy rez replacement,"the rez discourse is too much. people are complaining and won't stop, so maybe it's time to just give her a different ability. i mean it's not even that fun to use anyway.

my idea was to give her an ability that functions in a similar way but has more counter play. 


u can place a mark on an ally that stays for 2 seconds (time is debatable) and if they die within that time they spawn back in after a second with a maximum of 300hp (meaning that squishies will be at full health while tanks are capped at 300hp). 24 second cd


this gives players a counter to rez (not shooting the enemy once they see the mark) and also raises mercy's skill ceiling (having the timing down so enemies don't have time to react). On top of that this removes the LOS discussion for rez and doesn't make rezzing a tank as frustrating. 


I think mercy's ability should stay single target, as to not mess with her pocket identity as much. Another idea i like is overhealth u can place on an ally (think of it like sym 1.0 shields)

As a support traditionally should be in the backline and not having to take duels or bait out cooldowns 24/7 like tracer she shouldn't be at risk of getting killed instantly.

Why is it so difficult to rank up?,"Two seasons ago, I managed to achieve diamond in sup

Today, I can't get out of silver 1

It seems that the more matches you lose, the less chance you have of ranking up, even if you have the best stats during the game and played really well.

And in several of these matches there is a big difference between players on my team compared to the opposing team, basically either you humiliate or you are humiliated.

There are also several trolls, who end the sup match with 1k healing, or DPSs who are 1/11 (seriously, this actually happened in one of my matches.)

It seems that even if you play impeccably, there will always be someone on your team to ruin the game. And with that, climbing the ranks playing solo becomes an almost impossible task in lower ranks.

Blizzard needs to fix this.

I was the Hanzo, there was only one other real player in my team, the tank, dps and support were either standing afk in base or running and afk standing still in front of the enemy team without shooting. Don't think they were actual people controlling the characters as the movement was very odd (although I am in silver so who knows).

A player on the enemy team messaged in all chat ""All bot team?"" after only like 30 seconds in the match and at first I thought he was just joking as we got rolled first fight.

Change 1: His ultimate now also lets him fly upward, empowering his ultimate based on distance fallen. Second activation propels him downward.

Change 2: The farther he falls, the stronger his ultimate becomes. It becomes a wider cone the farther he falls, until it becomes 360 degrees. It also 1 shots anyone at the center at that point.

How do you not emotional when climbing,"Just like a lot of you, I play comp to climb but the problem for me is that I can get very emotional. I get upset if they a turret because I know my teammates aren’t going to do anything about it. They have a mercy, they can’t aim worth shit (and neither can I to be honest). I sometimes strain my throat yelling obscenities and the like (not into coms). I once gotten so angry that tears started to form. I also greatly tie my self worth to my rank, so if it goes down I feel like an embarrassment and should be ashamed of even trying to reach masters (I’m gold 4).

Play with friends: The only friend I play with is in masters and I prefer to solo queue because I feel like I’m being boosted if I play in a group. I also still get upset if I play with a friend.

A hero that was significantly influenced by poverty?(Diversity question),"Overwatch is praised for its Diverse set of characters and their backstories. We have different ethnicities, queers, races and etc.

But so far we havent seen anyone who was affected significantly by poverty or, in other words, being poor. The closest we got to it probably was Baptiste. But it is not shown nor in his dialogues, nor in his backstory.

It doesnt need to be a money/power hungry villain, it can be a nice guy that promotes modesty.

Is anyone still having fun in this game anymore?,"I feel like the majority of my friends have moved on from OW, but I still find it addicting sometimes. It’s really hard for me to get into an online shooter, so when I do, I hold on longer than most. The dynamic of matches has became increasingly dull though.

At first I appreciated the inclusion of the stat board, since people being toxic with no actual clue what was going on was such a common occurrence in OW 1, but now it’s turned everyone into stat watchers. More focused on a number, then what’s going on in the game.

Most recent match I had a rein push into spawn which kept getting him killed, he proceeded to blame me because he had 5 more kills than me. Kills that get you killed in the process, aren’t actual kills, but this dude didn’t understand that.

It’s crazy that I still see cringy toxic stuff from OW1, along with the stat board obsessing players who have “adapted” to OW2. I can’t go a match without someone calling out a 1 k difference, whether its healing or damage, as soon as someone in the losing team has a slight difference, it’s like all hands on deck.

Y’all need to understand that these matches are long, and the wind can always change, but you’re less likely to gain an advantage if your method of “support” is to abuse your teammates.

The other day I had a tank with half the damage of the opposing one, and all I said was “I believe in us.” They replied “yas queen.” Even though they didn’t match in damage, they ended with like 50 n 6 kills. Most of anyone in the match by far, and we decimated the other team. I’m just saying, I get that we all want to win, and when you have someone who is clearly not getting they need to switch, that’s different. But some of y’all are so ready to blame someone else, it’s like every match somebody needs to blamed. It’s like y’all think if you get in a “tank diff, healers trash, dps threw” then the winning team is gonna think “oh ok, this one guy was good, let’s leave here and respect this one guy.” They literally do not care. Just take the L and move on.
 
Again, I’m not saying we should all just be nice all the time and ignore stupidity, just ask yourself if it’s worth it. Is losing so scary to you that you absolutely cannot have any fun, because if that’s the case, I honestly don’t know why you get on.

Edit: just won a match, high kill count, POTG with Hanzo. Called out by our own tank at the end because of a 1K damage difference. That actually really frustrated me. Our team finished 3 n 1, wasn’t even close. Just, why? *sigh* I think the best advice I’ve gotten is to turn off chat, which is kind of sad cause I’ve had a lot of good feedback from there, and I also like to be able to communicate with my teammates. It’s not even enough to win and rack up headshots, you just need to be aiming for the tank and focus on your damage numbers in order for your team to feel like you contributed…",Overwatch,1705588810.0,t3_199rmiz

Other than that, why do I need to wait so long to just not get a penalty? 4v5 it's pretty much guaranteed loss all the time, I should be able to propose a concede to my teammates and if everybody agrees the game just ends and you move on.

A new concept for the Damage passive.,"Basically, if an enemy hero only has a sliver of ther maximum health left, you deal more damage.

Let's say they have 20% of their max health or less. Damage heroes would deal an additional 50% damage to them.

Like a League execute. Something that helps with securing kills and getting eliminations.

Obviously, you'd need to look into average damage dps to make sure it doesn't make the time to kill go into the ground, and characters like Genji and Tracer would probably get more out of this than most, but I think it could benefit more or less any damage hero.

Not to mention with every hero getting some kind of out-of-combat health regen, it would greatly help there too.

Kiriko could have a 40% win rate and still be frustrating to play against.,"I'm a GM DPS and Support. I've done it with Tracer, Ana, Moira, and Kiriko. so i'm not talking out of my ass knowing the differences between these roles and heroes. I saw a recent thread in the kiriko main subreddit where they legit did not understand the hate she gets all the time claiming she's a high skill character, has the same escapes as sojourn, tracer, reaper, sym, etc... and that she's not that strong citing win rates lots of times which as we know, win rates don't tell the full picture so those are pointless to bring up. Let me explain to people why it's not her balance but it's her kit that is designed to be as frustrating as possible.

so to put it simply...

# Even when you take a fight against Kiriko and win, you lose.

What hero in the game outside of kiriko can missplay every cooldown and still use their mobility to immediately get way to safety and provide team value while ignoring their own positioning?

lets say I take a duel with kiriko and I'm winning and I force both her CD's. I cannot chase her down and punish her. most likely i probably had to use CD's as well and she can TP back into the fight with 0 downtime as she can immediately heal and help her team while i need to walk back before i can do the same. That downtime in a fight is huge. She can keep healing and doing damage but i cannot reengage or catch up to her or my team in the same speed. I need someone else to capitalize on her in the next 7 seconds for her to die and her TP literally took her next to her teammate so she has guaranteed help already. the only way you win is by one shotting her or blocking her suzu and the current S tier DPS to play are Sojourn and Mei because of that reason.

I saw them post about her low accuracy of her kunai as justification that she's not that strong but if even GM players have 16% kunai hit accuracy and it really wasn't that strong why bother at all? Her damage doesn't need to be consistent to have a lot of value. you get it by spamming which makes it even more frustrating on the other end and her low consistency in hitting shots while still providing value is proof of that. and the kunai fly in a straight line so it's not hard to aim at head level spamming. a single headshot on anyone can be a quick pick or easy for someone else to follow up on. she's dangerous up close but also far away. Zen used to be the glass cannnon dps but you could dive Zen players that didn't have good positioning. Kiriko can be scary up close and far away and can't be dove easily. There is no range in which she is all that weak.

Kiriko's TP is also not like moira's fade, you can chase a moira that fucks up her fade and can see where she goes. you can chase a reaper as he telegraphs his TP and stands still for it. Sym needs to build her teleporter and has to be in LOS. Tracer you can literally only blink a short distance and needs to be mindful of how many she has and her cover around her. every hero with mobility still needs to be smart about their positioning. kiriko doesn't need to be. she doesn't have to play around cover and her TP is through walls and instant and it doesn't even need to be aimed. so even if you force her to use it you cannot follow as any hero. the moment she TP's out she also starts regaining health. Even then when other heroes save their mobility to take a risk in the enemy backline it is exactly that a risk they take but not for her.

now lets talk about Suzu. another immortality ability that can deny even hard to hit ultimates by throwing something at the ground. you don't even need to arc it like a nade as it throws in a pretty straight line. it's really not hard to hit a suzu and you can do it every 15 seconds. landing a hard to hit ultimate only to have it absorbed because a support threw something at the ground is frustrating. the skill expression needed to land what used to be game changing ultimates are getting countered by abilities that don't need to be aimed even. at least if i was nano'd as dps and i got slept it felt like the ana earned that. or if i hit a sticky or a grav but it was countered by beat it felt like a worthy trade. now it just feels like every support has an easy mode deny ability to shut down dps and tanks. or sometimes more than one. If i as a tracer am fighting a 2v1 and i blink 180 stick someone, that ultimate shouldn't be countered by a support throwing an ability at the ground. it doesn't feel like Kiriko earned that save vs what i had to do to try and get it.

now to anyone about to say ""you just need to bait out cooldowns first"". if that's what you believe then you are admitting that support dictates which teams win or lose. whichever team misuses their immortality abilities or forces their supports to misuse them is the one that loses and not the team who popped off or who made big plays. sitting there holding ultimates until you see supports make their move isn't fun for everyone else. there is no back and forth right now like there used to be. you used to counter ultimates with other ults and now you just counter them with regular abilities. supports holding these abilities make it so other players can't play. you can't junkerqueen ult knowing suzu is up. you can't sticky as tracer knowing suzu is up. You can't mei blizzard knowing it's up. you can't even grav if you know suzu is up. you can't even chase a kiriko down to kill her so you don't have to worry about it. her entire kit is meant to be frustrating to anyone other than her. you have to sit and wait for kiriko to fuck up to make your play and that is why it's not fun for literally anyone else. has nothing to do with winrate or whether the average player can get value out of her. Her kit dictates you taking action.

in a fair matchup of equally skilled players it is impossible to duel her and feel like you won anything out of that interaction but it is also impossible to ignore her and make a play on someone else. Her whole kit is meant to be frustrating to anyone other than her.

EDIT: To people telling me how to kill kiriko i'm well aware of what people need to do in order to counter her in her current state. Telling me that it requires teamwork to kill her well of course, that's true for any hero but it requires a lot more for her and you cannot 1v1 a kiriko and ever win. that's the whole point. besides even if i call out in comms that kiriko's tp is down what are the odds my whole team is even in voice? what if some are chat banned? every 1v1 duel with heroes in overwatch have a back and forth and each is trying to get the other to misuse their abilities to have an advantage to capitalize and outplay. kiriko doesn't have that. if she fucks up she can suzu and if she fucks up more she leaves in an instant. it's not a healthy design.

EDIT2: saying there are other supports with frustrating immortality abilities isn't a justification for her existing. saying there could be worse things in your opinion is not the strong argument you think it is. it is not a good reason to not try and improve what we have. we have a live game that is literally about constant iteration and changes that will happen so we should constantly want to improve what we have. comparing it to something like sleep dart is also not a fair comparison when i have a lot more confidence in landing a suzu than i do a sleep dart when a genji blades. the skill required for both is vastly different and they both have almost the same cool down. how easy an ability is to perform vs how much value it gets and when it needs to be used all play into how strong something is. most countering abilities are predicts and immortality abilities are reacts and it's much easier to react and perform these immortality abilities than it is to predict whats going to happen. this adds to how frustrating they are to deal with.

EDIT Final: For those still thinking I just want her nerfed into the ground that isn't it. number won't help her. if you think i don't have any ideas of how to do that you'd be wrong. if you want to know where i would hypothetically take her kit here's just me brainstorming what i'd like to see from her. 

* Damage - kunai now have a damage fall off. kiriko is scary up close and should be the brawler/anti dive support but she shouldn't be sniping and getting random picks like hanzo arrows because that's frustrating. this also helps teach players the best way to play her as it's easier to hit projectiles the closer you get so it's designed in a way that actually teaches players the best way to play her naturally. it also gives her a counter of long to mid range poke.
* Healing - her papers are no longer auto aim and actually need to be thrown onto someone where they will stick. they move similar in speed to ana no scoping shots. when you attach a paper to someone it will slowly release a heal over time but never over health. you can attach multiple to one target as well to stack but if you attach too many to one person you won't have them for your other teammates as they need to charge. you can hit them pre emptively to help incoming damage as well. if you miss the paper will attach itself to the closest geometry there and if an ally walks past the paper it will be picked up by them. this will allow kiriko to have more skill expression in her heals as well as help heal people that are constantly out of line of sight. she has a limited number of papers though so she has to pick between helping people flanking, stack them onto one person, or help on the frontline and can't just spam to everyone.
* Swift step - range is shortened but goes a set distance and can pass through one wall but doesn't need a teammate to teleport to. she can use it to just close a distance or get into a nearby room. she can use it to dodge abilities or in a duel for a better position. this means she can now use her mobility offensively or defensively but also needs to be mindful of her environment. it also means the person dueling her can feel like there's a chance to outplay her and her to outplay them.
* Suzu - still cleanses and heals but needs to actually hit an ally to cause the explosion cleanse. no longer makes players intangible or immortal though. however, it can also be throw at enemies to cause them to slow down but still would need to hit them. they still can use their abilities but helps give suzu a means to be used offensively, defensively, and also offensively like on a nano blade to help your team defensively. probably could have it's CD shortened this way as well because it would be harder to hit.
* Kitsune - i have fewest issues with i'm ok with leaving it alone.",Overwatch,1705569619.0,t3_199m559

Has Quicker Play made anyone else play more Competitive recently? Anyone else happier/thankful because of that too?,"Initially I was angry that quicker play was less fun because it's just not as fun anymore for several reasons like dying once or twice and the round is over, etc. but over the past couple of days I would reach for competitive more and more often because the games are actually longer like I want and this not only made me have more fun than I had before, this has solved a long time problem that I had with avoiding playing competitive and caring too much about my rank. Now I'm losing and not really getting that angry like it would ruin my day before quicker play started.

Why I dislike Season 8,"I have never been so frustrated with this game ever before, but this season has started the stress i have been receiving as of late.

First it was the start of the Mauga meta. Every game you either had to play auga or you would lose the game. Or if you beat the tank in a team fight, it would be an instant swap to mauga causing you to, Again, Swap to mauga.

Then the mid season patch comes, they buff sombra, sojourn, orisa, and lifeweaver.

 ""so now you can't have fun. Hahah!"" -blizzard executives

Tank and Dps still feel awful to play when everything you do gets out damaged or outhealed by supports. It is constantly tiring and annoying to play characters like Reaper or Roadhog, only to be instantly killed or denied any value by characters like Ana, Bap, and Kiriko. (I would say zen but he has went through enough + im a zen main)

Along with this I've been finding a whole lot more throwers in my games than ever. And I'm not tryna talk mean, but you got no idea how many bad players I have had recently, and I heard other players have had them as well.

Honestly I just hate this season cuz of the whole buffs and nerfs. Yall buff orisa n sombra, but you nerf hog? Ik the hog nerf wasn't big but it's just the thought of them Buffing Orisa but Nerfing Roadhog that sickens me.",Overwatch,1705547807.0,t3_199g4pk
Why can't Genji be any good?,"**GM 5 Take. I'm almost a Genji One Trick, 800+ Hours.**  
I just don't understand why. Genji has been Awful/Bad/Mid since his nerfs at S1. Everyone and even Blizzard says to us ""We want Genji in that spot, he is fine."" Don't get me wrong, Genji is not BAD. But he is NOT FINE either, it is a complicated case, i'd say.  
What makes Genji Mains(me included) feel bad/weak about him, is his Effort-To-Value ratio. I mean, i summed up, i can have like 650 dedicated into this Hero and still be in Diamond/Plat, while someone can have 1/3 effort/mechanical skill i do, get 3x the value i get and get GM maining other Heroes.  


Now with that explained, lemme ask something to you rq. Do you think when Genji was S Tier, before his nerfs, he was too annoying? There was a lot of people complaining that ""Genji was good""? Do you think Dive Meta is unfun to play with/against?  
Cause i don't, and i think most of the players also do not. I've heard from A LOT of Players, Streamers, Pro Players, Friends that the most FUN META is the DIVE META.   
So why people think Genji needs to be nerfed into the ground? He is a dive character. He has a high skill floor and high skill ceiling, so it's not like ""Uh, braindead character good, not fun"" No, Genji has to know what hes doing to confirm kills and make space, it is just a HARD Character being FUN and GOOD. That's all.  


We have a lot of characters that has been META SINCE THEIR RELEASE, we have characters that HAS NOT BEEN ANYTHING BUT INSANE SINCE THEIR RELEASE!  
Kiriko has not been bad a single Season in this game. Sojourn was hard meta and somehow GOT BUFFED. Ana, Bap, Illari, good since their release. Orisa gota a unnecessary buff rn, etc...   
Genji has easy counters and it's so easy to deal with him. All his counters got buffed since he got his HUGE NERF, poor boy? Symmetra, Zarya, Torb, Mei, Moira, Brig, they all got buffed since S1!

- Split up the Change of Pace challenge into 4 separate ones: 15 games of Mystery Heroes, 15 games of Deathmatch, 15 games of Arcade, and collect 4000 emblems in Hero Mastery.
- Change Role Mastery to count for any normal 5v5 mode including Mystery Heroes and some Arcade modes.

Overwatch character concept (healer) Sanguis,"(this was og back in overwatch 1 idea i made, but my audience wants me to post it on reddit) XD so if some abilitys seem off or like they already exist in overwatch now, that is why XD  
 

I loved Blame the controllers character concepts and wanted to make one of my own. I will follow the same idea (with a little less art or alot)

Hero Creation Method: 

Create an interesting ability and build around that. 

Goal for Sanguis

1: Create a 300 hp healer

2: Healing must be based off of damage 

3: be able to peel for her supporters or other allies. 

Sanguis, Talons combat ready healer, Ready to stand and fight or peel for allies. Why fight back when they hurt themself fighting us? Sanguis (concept) originally followed under mercy. Seeing her ways and taking notes. She knew mercy had a dark past and she refused to let anyone, even her friends know about it, even enough to push some away causing Sanguis to find her own answers. 

( selfish and selfless ) Left click and right-click selfish and selfless, selfish restores Health to the user using it, deals 40 damage a second while healing 20 and  selfless restore 40 HP per second stealing half from your own hp, up to half of your HP. you have 300 HP. Red effects come in and out when sucking life from your foes and healing from your allies.

Teather (e): Grabs the target and stops them from moving at full speed (50% movement speed reduction. During this time you cannot use your primary abilities (selfish-selfless). This ability lasts 2 seconds with a 8 second cd (has a 15 yard range activation distance)

(Charmic trap) shift: She puts down a trap that connects with the first foe to walk into it. If thrown again it replaces the first one. It causes no damage but when the attacker deals damage they take 20% of the damage dealt. It lasts for 4 seconds when triggered. It leaves dark red splotches on the person's screen indicating it's on them as it washes off. It has a 6 second cd and recharges after it is thrown out. It has a larger hitbox then junkrat's trap equaling a 2 meter size. 

Ultimately voiceline ""we all die as one "" 

The Ultimate has 2 effects: 

1 : creates a Winston bubble size sphere which shares HP between all Allied players within it to the percent of the lowest player. example;  Anna is at 50 HP and Baptiste is at 150 HP, each of their HP pools go to 100 every ½ second. 

2 : This heals 200 per second divided up per person in the ultimate. (if 2 people are in it, it heals 100 per second, if 4 it heals 50 per second. This ultimate lasts 5 seconds 

(It is blood red and not blue like Winston's bubble. It emanates around Sanguis and when someone is injured you see red particles fly between all the allies in the zone fixing the injured allies.

Passive: when your abilities are in effect you heal 10 per second (ability not primary or secondary)   


please feel free to tell me how to change it if its horrible XD ",Overwatch,1705544911.0,t3_199f50g
What are the best Overwatch Skins? #5 Brigitte,"I'd argue that Brigitte probably has one of the best skin catalogs of any hero. And I'd argue that it is because she is just very easy to make good skins for. She is a woman plated in armor with a mace and shield, which is already a pretty generic template to design skins for. And to Blizzard's credit, they do find a lot of good ways to reskin Brig and add to what she already is. 

Azure Drake does a fantastic job putting Brig in a more ""Fantasy"" aesthetic, and I'd argue is one of her best fantasy skins. Riot Police, despite my distaste for it, does do a good job dressing her up as a part of the police force as I think it fits her pretty well. Mechanic also does a good job expressing how good she is with machines. Her father is Torbjorn, and so I find it very cool that her intelligence and tech-savvy part of herself is expressed in this skin. And Antifragile BB works pretty well as a way to cast Brig as part of a K-pop band.

And while all of these skins are very good and really well executed, nothing compares to ""Sol"" Brigitte. And the reason why is simply because the skin fits really well with her aesthetic. Brigitte to me reads as a stoic warrior ready to aid her allies, and what better way to express that than to put her in some shiny paladin armor? The skin itself is also very well-detailed and does a good job reskinning her weapons to fit the fantasy aesthetic.

Enable mouse and keyboard support for console and add input based matchmaking,"This does not mean anyone on PC would be using aim assist or anything. This also obviously won’t solve the xim problem, as those players would still want to play in the controller pool to keep their cheating advantage.

But still, why not? Both the PS5 and Xbox series x/s support mouse and keyboard input natively. Many games, including some activision games, allow it. Controller players on PC would have an advantage over console players because they can have 300 FPS, sure. I don’t think that’s a good argument against allowing them to play in the console pool, but you can even just make it 1 way for fairness if you want (meaning console players with mnk can play on PC, but no PC players can play in console pool, regardless of input).

I don’t see any reason why you wouldn’t at least enable mouse and keyboard support for console and let them play in PC lobbies. Keep in mind that this isn’t some impossible new and expensive thing for blizzard to do. This is already a thing for MW3 and warzone. Any argument about these players being bad also means you shouldn’t let people on PC with <=120fps play the game either.

Silly Players,"For a group that loves to complain about supports, you folks sure don't try to shoot at them ever, even to pressure them into another position. If I play DPS, I pretty much don't get to play the game. If I am playing support, I not only don't die but pretty rarely get shot AT. 

Now I know I know, ""LeT mE wAlK bY tHe TaNk AnD 2 DpS tO dO tHaT"". I'm not saying you can do that, but I am saying that when I die as support, it is usually because at least one person realizes their guns have bullets that shoot further than their arms can reach and aim for me in the back line. 

Just some food for thought.",Overwatch,1705535938.0,t3_199bw6w

They also both have a charge and a damage mitigation type ability. Could also be a correlation between the flamethrower breath and Mauga setting people on fire. Moji just isn’t a tank.

Is there somewhere I can see overwatch server status to see if people are frequently disconnecting? I keep disconnecting for no reason and don't want to keep getting hit with losses,"The past few hours have seemed really bad with people disconnecting almost every match.

I didn't get hit with it until my last 2 matches. One match I was literally 5 seconds away from an easy win and i get disconnected and can't rejoin - probably because it already ended.

Is there somewhere where you can see if people are disconnecting a lot? I'm not talking about something like [downdetector.com](https://downdetector.com) as the servers are technically not down, it is just one of those days where there are so many disconnects you can't have a normal game.

On brighter side of things we like about OW2...,"On brighter side of all things OW2, I really like that hero progression tracks different stats/things for every hero, so in a long run you can actually kinda infer somebody's or your own playstyle, based on what level you are on each stat.

I'll bring screenshot of my Reinhardt for example, because 1, he is my main ""main"" and 2, I really like the story that this screenshot, and these numbers progression always, tell you about how I play. I'm a data/numbers guy, and I love this shit!

https://preview.redd.it/a6l54cib72dc1.jpg?width=3440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2bf42ef98b8056b8b596d4e9d48e3d0affbc488

I'm an ""aggressive"" but ""good""(ish?) Rein and it comes with its goods and bads!

So the highest stat is, def obviously if you played w me, Charge Pins; it's my strongest suit. I do predictive charges often and often successful! It's my special Rein sense or something and it's totally MY Rein's main thing to notice. Then comes Damage Mitigated and Time Played, kinda going hand in hand; which makes sense, its basically your shield uptime and your beefiness which is your function as a tank and thus comparable with time played. Then it goes to Damage Dealt and Shatter Stuns; this I guess means my damage falls a little behind. but shatter stuns being in my top 5 stats also makes sense; since I usually get big shatters (but sometimes not so well-timed, which is why my shatter kills is my lowest stat, but before getting there..) . Next up is Fire Strike Hits and Wins. Fire Strike Hits makes sense; I pretty much use it on cooldown and sometimes not throw the best ones. Wins being 98 compared to my Time Played being 114, is kinda your win percentage; its not great for me here, but its decent. Then in the end is Weapon Kills and Shatter Kills. I was surprised to find Weapon Kills here; this means I dont use my hammer too much. This screenshot was a few weeks ago and this for example was a good note for me to increase my hammer swinging! And last is Shatter Kills, which I guess makes sense since sometimes I get over excited and hit a 5 man shatter, only then to realize my whole or most team is dead... I know; its a problem.. but therefore, high Shatter Stuns count but low Shatter Kills count.

And Voila! You can literally find my strengths and weakness by looking at that screenshot or opening Progression at any moment. You can use this to find your weak points and focus on those; or to exploit your strong points. 

Anyways, its a cool little thing. I like it!",Overwatch,1705526223.0,t3_19980rr

It’s impossible to believe Overwatch is set 60 years after 2016.,"
I was just getting out of a match in Overwatch 2 and I’ve started to think about it. I’ve been playing the first game since the year it came out back in 2016, and I do know for a fact the devs at one point said that the events of the game takes place approximately 60-70 years into the future. How, exactly?

Flying cars, flying airships, floating areas and the fact that they use this weird, levitational technology on objects with wheels but it seems that the wheels are just designed for show. It’s just hard to believe that the lore takes place 60 years after 2016. I mean, 60 years? Seriously? It seems at least 200 years with all these designs and vehicles etc. I don’t think after 60 years our world would gorgeously look like that.

I’ve always been fascinated by the lore of Overwatch, I think it has such an amazing and interesting universe.

And one of the things that fascinates me the most is the fact that the Arabic language exists in this world, I am Arab myself and seeing an Egyptian character like Ana is so so amazing! Her lines and speaking dialogues are 100000% spot on and it is EXACTLY how modern Egyptians sound today. Not just her voice, even her words in Arabic are just so precise and native. I find it amazing how blizzard truly outdid themselves in terms of getting an Arab person to voice her perfectly. Aysha Selim did such a tremendous job!

Not only do I like the fact that Arabic exists, but it’s so cool to see a woman having a history of being a soldier turned general in the Egyptian military. Today in Egypt, only men are enlisted to be combat or war soldiers in the Egyptian army, armed forces only accept women as civil workers or specialized officers outside of combat missions. A woman in Egypt now can get enlisted as a registered nurse for example, or a medical officer, but not as a combat soldier.

This is why I find it impossible that it’s set only 60 years into the future. I think it’s WAY into the future. I don’t see women being finally permitted to enter the military in Egypt in 60 years from now a plausible or even a convincing possibility. I might be wrong, but as an arab who knows Arabic societies very well, I just don’t think it’s believable.",Overwatch,1705517809.0,t3_1994h7q

I don't think genji needs much of a buff but I do think he should have a small one,"Whenever I play genji I always end up nose deep in the backline or backing off entirely, this is due to one thing, reflect.

I think reflect should be resource based without a cooldown between uses but a bit of time to recharge and if you run out it's a long cooldown

That'd make genji easier to dive in without worry because your sustain isn't a one time use, this would also make it harder to bait but easier to overwhelm.

mauga rework idea,"ok so i see that mauga is too annoying to fight so i have come up with a rework idea for him

 so first i thikn they should remove both of his guns and replace them with pharah rockets. he can shoot 5 rockets a second with both guns but if you shoot both the spread increases and he shoots 10 rockets a second. this removes his fire and crit dmg while making him still good. he has 100 ammo 

then i think they should  remove his cardiac overdrive and instead give him a nano boost type ability. so he heals 400hp and gets 40% dmg reduction and 40% dmg boost for 5s and the cooldown is 10s

then i think they should remove his running ability. i think they should replace it with a genji dash. he will go 20m in 0.1s and it will do a 100 dmg aoe. with 8s cd but it resets everytime he gets a kill

then his ult is annoying so i just make it so that instead of locking everyone in a cage mauga will activate his ult and then he will do a pharah barrage that goes through walls. so you cant use cover against his ult

i think they should also remove all of his hp but give him 500 shields and every second he generates 30 overhp even while taking dmg capping at 500 overhp",Overwatch,1705516023.0,t3_1993qdd

Because of Junkrat's HARD HARD counters, you're basically just trolling if you use him. 

I don't think he needs a buff, but he does need a rework on his frustrating and one sided playstyle. I've had my fun with it, carrying games and all but sincerely most of time it was solely because of people not even trying to counter me with like a Zarya, Pharah-Mercy, Widow, etc.

Discussion about FPS cap,"So I have a question about capping your fps and its been a question for a long while, my means by capping is having the most minimal latency while having no possible drawbacks.

I am atm running uncapped and my fps doesnt go below my monitors refresh rate which is 165hz, my fps can fluctuate between 200-300 depending on what is happening in game.

Coming to the question, is it worth to find out your average fps and capping it to that and not letting it fluctuate so hard? Would it give more consistent results by having a consistent delay instead of it going up and down?",Overwatch,1705512413.0,t3_19926fz

OW2 CORE Problems? 5v5 or 6v6? Support 👩‍⚕️ > DPS ⚔️> Tank 🛡,"Since Devs teased a little (yet controversial) change to the game, let's discuss is it really THAT bad, or community is just overreacting?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/luo4lal921dc1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a282b6224d4c1e60939e704d311b7504ea01cdea

# 1. It's a TEAM BASED GAME

One of the main reasons of mass hate is that everyone out of sudden felt the TeAm SpiRiT in OW2 and got offended that their role (supps) is irrelevant now since there's self-heal for everyone. Let's be honest:

* **Team Based Idea is gone** when OW became 5v5 FPS. One tank is not enough to protect their team properly, now everyone survives as best they can. Second tank was always there to peel or do some flanking engagement when the other was shielding, so the rest of team were REALLY busy doing their respected role jobs. DPS were focusing on doing dmg, supports were pumping heals and E's to enable their tanks. THIS is where team based factor of game was thriving. Other question is was it good?
* **6v6 or 5v5?** 6v6 was incredibly team based but also very stagnant and boring. The amount of shields, cc abilities, GOAT... On the other hand there's 5v5, more amusing, dynamic but self-centered gameplay where any mistake of single player can drastically impact on the final outcome. Each has their own pros and cons. Frankly, it's hard to find a silver lining, and everyone might prefer one or another style (Maybe 5.5 v 5.5 would do better). This is where the core problem lies.
* **Comm Problems**. People point at 'team beased' feature but tend to play with randoms, w/o mic, refusing to switch to counter picks preferring their mains... I mean, guys, be real with yourself. If you're not playing with group of 5 chatting in discord and discussing comp and doing callouts, please, don't stutter about TeAmWoRk. Other than that is just a improvised adaptive play style, where no one switches and blame others anyway.

&#x200B;

# 2. TANK, DPS, SUPPORTS whining complaints

* **TANKS**. Since there's only 1 tank, the first thing is it's UNfun for tanks to experience the game. While other roles can compensate weak parts of their collegue, tanks DON'T have such privileges. They have to switch to counter or to adapt to their own team. Thus, they usually forget about maining DVA or Ball, and switch to counter tank. Second part of the problem is that they strongly rely on other 2 roles, while these roles don't actually care since their high mobility and sustainability. Overall tank experience is great, if you ignore the fact of winning games and protecting your team. Core problem of tanks is the absence of 2nd tank to comfort their playstyle.
* **DPS**. Universally, this role is in optimal state, except maybe some horrible ultimates and overall obsolete ability kit. Main problems of the role lies in the other role (yes, supports). All they can do, supports can do better (most of them), and additionally they can heal, survive, safely disengage. Why you gotta be precise Widowmaker, search for good spot, have 175 hp when there's Kiriko that pops out of nowhere, cleanses your venom mine, two taps you in close distant, parcour the f outta there and then heals herself. Not to exaggerate, but it do be like that sometimes. But actually, it's not even supports' fault, the same reason is that they were designed in 6v6 game mode, and they were mostly busy healing 2 tanks rather than dealing dmg by themself.
* **SUPPORTS**. The problem of this role is that it's 2 edged sword. You either give them powerful abilities so they can survive against crazy DPS role and be immortal, or weaken these abilities but they become easy prey and useless. Non of these changes will make everyone satisfied, buff Supps = DPS and Tank cry, nerf Supps = Useless supps cry. Again, problem is in the lack of 2nd tank to protect them. The Supports role itself hard in OW2 since they have to manage a LOT of things at the same time: to heal, to save, to do dmg, to survive themselves, and everyone blames them at the end. So we got high sustainable heroes that deal (not as good as DPS, but still) decent damage, but the main reason they're good at duels with DPS is their survival abilities that give them extra lives to cover their mistakes.

&#x200B;

# 3. Changes to numbers are not enough!

People HAVE to understand that the sole number tweaking is not enough. There still will be balance problems, some heroes will be thriving, while other gotta be in F-tier.

There should deffinetely be changes, CORE changes to the game. Since the heroes and gameplay initially were designed in 6v6 environment, it's clear now that some roles are hardly fitting in present 5v5 state. They're either OP or trash.

&#x200B;

# 4. SOLUTIONS

In my opinion EVERYONE should have a great and fun experience in game\*, EACH role. You have to stop being egoistic one-role trick main, and think about other people and roles.\*

*Here are some fast ideas of how to solve the role balance problem (just author's ideas):*

&#x200B;

* **TANKS** should get increased base movement speed. Reduced incoming critical hit damage. (These might be good for tank's self survivability, and making them potentially dangerous to get closer)
* **DPS** should get small self healing passive and increased damage boost when they're under 30-40% of their health.
* **SUPPORTS** should agree that their current state is unhealthy for game, but to leave it that way Blizzard HAVE to buff other roles passive.
* Implement new core game feature **""Ult exchange""**. The idea is that every player can exchange uncharged ult-bar points to get some boosts. Limited to 3 times per match, and increasing in cost after each use. Each role has unique boosts when using:-
* &#x200B;

1. Tank. Have their HP immediately healed up to 300\~400 hp-

* 2. DPS. Boost their damage by 10\~20%-
* 3. Supports. Increase their speed of movement and CD reduction timer.

For people that would say it's imbalanced, again, it reduces ULT bar points percentage based, in exchange for such boosts.

Victorian era Widowmaker,"Greetings OW community 

This is my concept art for a Victorian era skin. 

Widow is my second entry for this concept idea.

Below is the description of the skin. Please let me know what do you think? Thank you

""In the enigmatic alleyways of gaslit Victorian streets, emerges the mysterious figure known as Widowmaker, a haunting presence with a steampunk allure. Clad in ornate attire that seamlessly melds the opulence of the Victorian era with the intricate aesthetics of steampunk, she is the embodiment of elegance and lethality.

Widowmaker's eyes, once filled with life, now glow with an otherworldly intensity as she peers through the lens of her infrasight. This advanced optical device, a masterpiece of steam-driven engineering, grants her the ability to pierce through shadows, revealing the secrets hidden within the murky corners of her surroundings.

Her weapon of choice, a steam-powered rifle, echoes with the hiss of escaping steam as it readies itself for a deadly shot. 

Adorned with brass embellishments and intricate clockwork mechanisms, the rifle embodies the fusion of Victorian craftsmanship and futuristic innovation. 

Each pull of the trigger unleashes a precise burst of steam-driven power, leaving her adversaries ensnared in a deadly dance of gears and shadows.

Widowmaker moves with a haunting grace, her every step echoing the sophistication of a bygone era. The cobblestone streets bear witness to her silent approach, as she navigates the labyrinth of gears and contraptions that lie concealed beneath the surface of the Victorian world.

A figure shrouded in mystery, Widowmaker traverses the delicate balance between the elegance of the past and the enigmatic power of the future.

 In this steampunk-infused Overwatch universe, she is the embodiment of a bygone era's allure, a lethal enforcer weaving her destiny through the intricate tapestry of time and technology.""",Overwatch,1705507656.0,t3_19903zk

Skin bug on Widowmaker,"I've played a few games some were quickplay matches some were competitive. I noticed this bug for the first time like 3-4 weeks ago, I would swap my Widowmaker skin during the game and then I would load in with the skin I had equipped before.

I didn't play much more Widowmaker after that until recently and  I just had the bug happen again. I played Widowmaker a few more times to see if this was consistent, and it was.

So what’s the incentive or thing to work towards if I don’t have the battle pass or play comp?,"If I don’t want to spend money for the battle pass, or the battle pass has nothing that interests me there’s nothing to work towards there. 

If I play a certain character and want a skin I have to pay for it now instead of overtime being able to purchase it. 

I don’t see a reason to play comp cause still many matches seem to be either steamrolled one sided matches, not all and it has improved since launch but still enough to where I don’t want to work towards it just to gamble each time if this match will be like that or not.

Aside from still enjoying the core gameplay there’s really no incentive for anything (in my opinion) 

I miss Overwatch 1, the loot boxes cause I feel like I’d actually get some reward, 6v6 for the reason of having a group before and now having to leave someone for QP or comp.

What if Iggy became a playable character?,"So, I posted yesterday a question what future heroes you'd like to have in the game. I mentioned I'd like Iggy because she has a very good character design (imo), although I haven't read the London calling comic yet. My understanding of her is that she is a leader of sort for the Omnics in King's Row, but also that she has taste for rock themed music.

I did my own concept of what her kit could look like as I was bored. However I do think it's unique and may fit her character while provide good value to the team.

Name: Iggy

Health: 200

Armor: 25

Weapon: Dual sidearm

Ammo: 15 rounds per sidearm (30 in total)

Weapon damage: 10 per hit (20 if both sidearm hit)

Role: Dps

Ability 1: [60's punk] Iggy amp up her music, increase her reload speed and movement speed with 10% and gains a +7,5hp/s for 6s. 
Cooldown: 8 seconds 

Ability 2: [Electro-rock] Iggy charge her dual sidearm for 7s, each shot deal electric damage which deal 5dmg/s for 3s. As well increase her rate of fire with 5%. She deal 1.3% extra dmg against shields and -0.5% against armor.
Cooldown: 11 seconds 

Ultimate: [Rock 'n' Roll] Iggy create an 10m shockwave which grants her and nearby allies +300 overhealth for 4s, as well increase Iggy's damage x2 for 6s. 

Now I am not very skilled enough to understand the game and all. However with what knowledge I have and what I believe would make a interesting and new gameplay experience for a new hero. I think it could be a fun concept. What do you think of this?",Overwatch,1705502539.0,t3_198y37i

Doomfist Buff?,"TL; DR
Power Block gains knockback resistance. Empowered Rocket Punch gains additonal DoT. Rising Uppercut readded weaker and on a long cooldown.

**To clarify, Seismic Slam and Meteor Strike stays the same, they aren't removed.**

**Power Block**

Any negative status effect received in the state will be applied with half the potency. You sleep or get stunned half as long, you get knockback half as much, among other status effects.

Using Power Block leaves Doomfist in a vulnerable position to receive a javelin in the face, slept, anti-ed, pinned, hooked with other miscellaneous effects. So having additional CC resistance would put Doomfist on par with every other tank which can block CC, with a few exceptions being able to heal themselves instead.

Being the only defensive ability for Doomfist as a tank, it is lackluster. Being CCed out of Power Block usually results death.

**Rocket Punch**

Empowered Rocket punch will deal an additional 20-80 damage depending on charge, over 4 seconds to the first enemy it hits which doesn't include blastback.

The additional damage is capable of dealing 200 damage in total, with a fully charged empowered punch, assuming that they do not get healed over the time of 4 seconds which is an unlikely case and rather should be used as extra damage to help secure eliminations on isolated targets in conjunction with his other damage sources.

It also gives more fear and consideration into playing around his empowered punch as current players don't really care about the difference between a normal and an empowered punch.

**Add Rising Uppercut**

Just the original Rising Uppercut but with no AOE, 30 damage and on a 14 second cooldown, alternatively it can share the same cooldown as Rocket Punch instead. The ability can be bound to reload or jump to prevent too many abilities like in the case of the release of Lifeweaver.

Being the mobile tank Doomfist is, he gains unorthodox strengths and weakness. Less blocking damage for the team, more disturbing and reaching enemy backlines. It is not intended to be a vertical Rocket Punch, rather a tool to traverse the map or in niche cases hold a singular target in place for a short time to get some damage in with Hand Cannon and of course gain minor overhealth.

A necessity or not, a good number of Doomfist players would welcome the additional option in their gameplay. The avaliability of Rising Uppercut should be limited as giving him too much mobility and disruptive ability will make it not great for enemy player experience.

**Conclusion**

While it may be true Doomfist's ultimate is weaker compared to his tank counterparts, where other tanks have ultimates which can change the course of the game, Doomfist has the ability to change the course of the game with his 3 abilities alone, or at least that's how I think he is intended to be.

These changes would likely make Doomfist strong, but I hope that my concepts does not make him oppressive. **Just a fun post by me on what could've been.**",Overwatch,1705490269.0,t3_198u9tc
