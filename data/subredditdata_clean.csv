Do you think it would be possible to file a class action lawsuit towards blizzard?,"Not saying I will. I was just thinking about it and was wondering how others felt about it. Because I mean, come on. I paid $60 for a game that was good, and worked and I enjoyed, only for them to take that away completely and replace it with an objectively inferior product that didn't even have all the promised features in the first place. They couldn't even keep the product I paid for running along side the new product that is now free for everyone. And something about that feels really really scummy.

Just had a support throw three seperate games because they were complaining about other teammates,"First game on the opposite team, they threw by not participating and leaving the team 1 support down.
 Next game, they were on my team, within the first minute, they complained about my healing and said they would do the same as last game if I didnt do more. They then proceeded to throw in the same way.
 About an hour later, I'm in another game first round is a back and forth but my team takes it in the end. Second round I see the enemy team type in chat ""healers are throwing"" then the same support who threw the other games chimes in ""i cant contoll the useless tank"".

A Discussion about support and Damage,"I hope the title is done in the best of my ability and knowledge cause it about me as a support 
But also me talking about the team who pick damages. New time posting so if I get anything wrong I full heartedly agree if the post needs to be taken down 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello! I have been playing overwatch sense about 2017 and I have come across this couple of times but I’m not fully understanding why people get so mad about it. I’m in a match and at the start I played as Illari, we were winning until a Sombra showed up and would never go after my damage just me, my other support did nothing the first round. So I switched to Moira to help combat not only the Sombra but also help combat the tank MAUGA on the enemy team.
 We won the first round and I had about 15 kills, the end of the second round I had ask my dps if they could like, help me get rid of the Sombra so I can focus more of my healing and not have to play dps Moira all the time. They didn’t respond so I took it as maybe they would help me. The enemy had taken the point until 85% and when I asked them, “ if you can’t play Hanzo or junkrat  may you please switch off I have a really good winning streak and I don’t want to loose it."" they had 5 and 8 kills the whole three rounds. 
i had 24 as Moira and Illari. they start completely going off the rails and even the zenyatta yelling and cussing at me for just asking them if they could switch cause i had 8,789 Damage and 5,134 healing cause anytime i would get to them when they were critical, they would already be dead by the enemy team, and when I were with them, they would already be full of health. they started screaming at me that I wasn't doing healing, but how am I supposed to heal when the DPS are really doing anything which makes me have to be DPS for them and then they want to cuss me out when i'm not healing them because not only does Moira healing is small but because i keep dying to the sombra i cant help that i'm not there every second of the round for them. 

So when I’m basically trying to ask is why does DPS get so mad at support for asking them to take care of a character that is having a hard time for the support to be supports and why can’t I asked them if you don’t know how to play Hanzo or junk rat ( both two dps were playing these two characters) or you’re not very good at it and I’m having to do both which I shouldn’t have because you chose to play DPS in role pick, why are they going to scream and cuss me out if honestly I ask them nicely and I think it unfair for me to do both and then get yelled at for pointing out my frustration. I understand overwatch is just for fun but if it’s for fun, why am I having to stress out taking care of this team if they’re going to yell at me for just asking them to switch. 

There’s other characters you can play there’s over 37 characters that you can play that you could do well at and if you just wanna have fun, you could just go into AI I’m just overall confused of why I got yelled at. 
And if there’s any other way I could get tips on how to ask Team Mate to switch without sounding rude, which I wasn’t rude, but they were men and just flip the chats that woman was asking them to change.

This is not to be hating on anyone or I don’t wanna arguments in the comments about if I was wrong or if they were wrong I am just wondering like what am I supposed to do in the situation to make it better for not only my team, but also if I come across this again.",Overwatch,1706040312.0,t3_19dxjdt

What If Efi Was A Hero? | Hero Concept,"Name:  Efi Oladele (Orisa’s creator)

Role: Support

Health: 125 health, 75 shields



Primary Fire: Wrench throw 
Throw a projectile wrench with a big hit box that deals increased damage to armor. (1 ammo.)



Secondary Fire: Energy Wave
Use an old OR15 hand to blast a healing wave. This wave heals less the more it travels. (70-50 healing based on distance. 5 ammo. Pierces through teammates.)



Ability 1: Override Net
Throw a net that can attach up to three enemies in the area hit. This net makes it so any damage dealt to anyone in the net is also shared to the other enemies in the net. (Lasts 5 seconds. Shared damage is reduced by 45%)



Ability 2: Glitch Sphere
Send out a holographic sphere that pulls enemies to the center of it. (Orisa’s old halt ability.)



Ultimate: Fire Wall
Create a big glowing shield, that deflects every enemy projectile for 8 seconds. (No damage can go through this shield. Indestructible.)



Passive: Anti-Virus
When one of Efi’s cooldowns are on cooldown, she gains a 10% speed boost. When both abilities are on cooldown, she gains a 15% speed boost.

Example one. A junkrat with 17 deaths complaining about not getting heals. He has 7 more deaths than the rest of us. My brother in christ, there is no amount of healing that will save you from dying while repeeking the same angle and standing there for too long. If you think the supports are doing so terrible with healing you, why are you not on soldier or mei? 

And then simply getting people to group the fuck up. You're not going to go super saiyan and get a lucky potshot on the mercy from 50m away as a soldier. You're not helping by sprinting ahead and peeking a character that can one shot you while the rest of us are coming out of spawn. So many different situations...

Even after reports, I changed my way of communication avoiding saying bad words and changing everything in general, and still, I got muted for 13 days, I wonder why?

Are DPS players just cosmetic in this game or do you just get bots after a few rounds.,Idk Lately if I play any other roll than dps my dps are good for like 3 matches and then the next 5 they go like 2-9 and one even went 3-17. They blamed supports and tank of course even tho they had 14k+16k healing done that match from their supports which is far more than the other team. The Tank didn't seem that bad either because he outlasted them every time but because nobody was dying he would eventually have to back up or die.

Support Achievements Question,"Hey so I had a quick question about some of the support achievements regarding specific characters.  I really enjoy and want to get even better at some of the supports, but I am having a very difficult time obtaining some of them on specific characters and it makes me think that not being able to get them kind of means I'm just not good at them or not playing them right at all.  Specifically lifeweaver for instance.  I feel like I do fairly well with using his entire kit, healing and doing alright damage every game, making a few saves here and there or repositioning someone out of an ult or etc.  but I just can't seem to get 3 saves in 1 life or the X amount of healing with 1 tree.  This also goes for lucio and his 3 kills while wall riding.  I know people say just boop off 3 people then wall ride before they die but I feel like that is really hard to get, esp after they see im lucio and stay a mile away from a ledge.

I just want to know is it normal to take a long time to get these, and should it discourage me from playing them in that I might possibly not be playing them correctly if I can't get their achievements?

Edit: Also, I seem to get really wrapped up in the post game stats that are attached to a character and feel like if I'm not raising them all decent then I'm not playing them right either.

Just started playing OW after 4 years away,"I played comp placements and landed in gold. Every game we lose first fight, the whole team just starts being nasty and blaming.

I tried to encourage positivity but both teams started flaming me as healer. I had most healing in match. I don't understand. I play other games that are notorious for bad communities, but OW2 takes the cake no contest. 

People should not be freaking out this much over gold lobbies. I understand as a team based game you will lose frequently even though you play great, and I won't be putting my best foot forward every game, but I get several matches where it seems like half my team is already on full tilt before we've made it 30 seconds into the match.

Just tried the assault maps for the first time. I'm a fan.,"Got tired of playing mystery heroes in my down time so I switched to assault maps on arcade. I have a few things to say about it.

I can see why this game mode is both hated and loved. The maps are beautiful. There are plenty of team fights. There's a bunch of action and room for playmaking. And the objective is simple. You either cap the point or stop the enemy from capping. There's no need to worry about keeping the robot a certain distance from the enemy spawn, or how many people you keep on the payload and how many will push up. You don't get your rhythm messed up in between different maps. You just have one simple thing to do in this mode. 

I despise open queue and have had some of my favorite matches playing assault. I finally see why so many people want Hanamura back. Winning a nice back and forth game on attack feels *so* good - which brings me to my next point. 

Like many opinions that I've read about the mode, I'd have to agree that the map favors the defenders. The game has for some reason decided to put me on the defenders side about 80% of my matches. It's so easy to defend on these maps if you have a good comp. The spawn advantage on second point is ridiculous. I can't even imagine playing this mode in competitive where every single round goes into overtime. 

Overall, I'd want 2cp back in role queue. It'd probably become my favorite game mode.",Overwatch,1705986359.0,t3_19dgnqq

Who is the least smartest character lore wise?,"I say Ashe. Ashe has a gang and an omnic butler, still loses to one guy who is literally holding back from killing them. Meanwhile Ashe is completely filled with bloodlust on wanting him dead.

Cassidy uses his surroundings to his advantage (e.g using falling boulders as a cover while reposition). Ashe continues mindlessly standing in the wide open even after she got stunned by a flashbang and nearly got shot. 

Ashe has better numbers and arsenal but she still utilizes poorly. Like she could have sent BOB to grab Cassidy while everyone provides suppressing fire, Ashe also can use dynamite to blow up Cassidy or force him out of cover.

Ashe also didn't learn anything from her defeat. Her greediness actually led to her downfall that she could have gone home with plenty of spoils in exchange of letting Cassidy and Echo walk free, but now she goes home empty handed (plus losing a bike).

Support rework ideas for fun pt2,"Title, This is the second half of my ideas, which I wrote out because i was bored. 

Aimed at balancing characters around how annoying they can be to deal with more than their actual impact. 


Kiriko:

Headshot damage dropped to 90. 

TP cooldown bumped to 8 seconds. 

I got nothing for Suzu. It's annoying but it's also not horribly imbalanced imo, it together with everything else is the problem to me, and I play Ana predominantly, so I'm used to getting cleansed but eh, that's fair enough. It's a bit needed atm to deal with insanely high burst damage.

Reasonings: Yes yes I get it, high skill ceiling for aim. However, more often than not this kills you through ranged random spam. 140 damage on a single spammed support Character is NUTS. 90 means you don't get double dinked by lucky spam halfway across the map but still take enough damage to get the message and fuck off. If she lands 3, you're either really unlucky or you over stayed your welcome. 
In a close up duel, It would be 2 head taps and a melee or a body shot. That's fair imo. Even as a support main I feel like kirikos damage output is just way too high for someone as survivable as she is. Lucio is hella survivable but he needs either a perfect 4 hit burst to match her damage or a combo. She's more survivable than he is at times and can consistently just out damage him on pure luck.

It should take SOMETHING more than hoping two headshots connect, and on players that actually do have good aim, she's more dangerous than many DPS are at times. Pretty much everyone she fights has to land ALOT of shots to kill her, but she only has to land 2, can invuln for a second to dodge big cooldowns, heals a burst of 80hp, and after 6 seconds can just vanish. Half the time you are fighting her she's tp'd in with a flanker and only has to land one shot for the flanker to confirm your death.

Its a bit much imo and I don't think these changes would be a massive reduction to her effectiveness, but it would make her less annoying and less able to do things that are a bit dumb. 


Ana:

Split sleep and Anti into two charges, each at half duration (and damage in antis case, though I would love to see the chaos of full damage double antis lmao) 

Reasoning:

The anti point has been made before, people dislike it. I as an Ana player don't really agree that it's a source of an issue, but a symptom. 
However, I can agree that 3 whole seconds where possibly no one can be healed is an issue at times. 
With how much burst damage and healing is in the game, I do think it's needed to keep some of that in check, but sure, 3 seconds on one throw is probably a bit much. 1.5 seconds gives your team a good shot at either confirming a kill or making a sizeable dent in their HP so the other team struggles a bit more to heal it up and landing the second means you can continue that, or give someone else an issue to deal with.

With sleep, this moves it somewhat closer to being an interrupt rather than a hard stun. Sleep being a high skill to hit thing I think its pretty fair as is right now, but it would be nice to have two for various situations even at half effectiveness. 

It also kinda helps a bit with dealing with various situations, and it gives you a chance to correct a mistake someone makes in waking someone up when you've just hit them. 
 

Mercy: Rez revives at 20%HP. If you want to rez at a higher HP level, you MUST commit to more time spent holding the cast. 80% is the max, takes 3 seconds to reach full charge. LOS breaking disables the cast. 

Damage boost can be applied for 5 seconds and then it swaps to healing. Cannot apply damage boost to the same target for another 5 seconds. If you flick between dmg boost and healing, it locks you out for however long that damage boost was applied. I.E, 2 sec boost, 2 sec cooldown on that character. 5 secs is your maximum at a time. 

Sympathetic healing is disabled.

GA time increased to 4 seconds, GA burst heals her for 40hp. Jumping from GA sends you 25% further.

Reasoning: 
Mercy was my first character in 2017. I learnt the game with her and I think she's a fantastic character with a higher skill ceiling than people give her credit for. That being said, she enables braindead gameplay way too much. I play her and love doing it, yet I also watch other mercys and regularly think ""How do you get away with something as dumb as that?""

Rez is a problem but I don't feel it's conceptually broken just executed poorly. 
If you want to quickly dart in and rez in a risky situation your team should be required to cover for you. This is rarely the case. More often than not she can just hold that Button down and revive as soon as you die or fly straight to someone and rez them without much risk. 

These changes make it so that she CAN pick someone up immediately, but she MUST provide support to that person instead of just fucking off again and having a full HP, likely full cooldown character back in play for free.
Again, your team should have to cover for a rez, not just expect and get it for nothing.
If you want to bring someone back at a higher amount of HP, again you have to cover her longer. 
Mercy should have to think about this properly. If someone dies, a mistake was made, you shouldn't get a blank slate for a mistake. 

Damage boost timer and lock out is to prevent pocketing someone with damage boost indefinitely.  

Properly cycling damage and heals is how you play mercy well, but you still get insane value for just doing one or the other, this stops that and encourages you to play her in the way that is optimal, it's both a restriction on her most annoying method of play, and a semi enforced teaching tool to teach mercy players how to rotate their damage boost between players and not just to focus on pockets. 

Sympathetic healing, is dumb. It's lifesteal from moira but through healing onto a team mate and it makes killing a Mercy extremely tedious, I disagree with its existence. 

GA cooldown encourages a mercy to be more selective with it, and to position better in general so shes in less danger but can heal people more readily, it should be a commitment to fly to someone and help them. Again, a learning tool baked into her design. The GA jump distance boost is to let you position more creatively or nope out of a bad GA a bit better. 

The GA health boost helps compensate for the drop in survivability, if you dont interrupt her healing after she has GA'd, her passive will kick in. 

So you have more time to kill her in general after she has used GA but if she's escaping she does have a better chance of survival.",Overwatch,1705967178.0,t3_19da8j3

Support Character rework ideas for fun pt 1,"Title, this is cuz I'm bored but would also like to see them. Most of these aren't aimed at massively changing the balance but are aimed at making said characters less annoying, with the first character being an exception, I just want that change personally. 

Split into two parts for length. Part 2- ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/s/MAtkw9RZ41 )

Lucio: 

When on healing aura, booping team mates burst heals them for 40hp. Speed aura gives them a 1 second speed boost (speed boost % doesnt stack with aura)

Boop takes your movement direction into account and pushes you in that direction a small bit. Like a minor dash of a couple meters.(this one really is for fun only. Would give his mobility a bit of extra flair.) 

Reasoning:
Nice bit of extra healing, let's you give particular team mates the ability to chase a bit more or get away further, while being able to continue healing, more decisions to make for lucio when helping team mates. 




Moira:

Primary fire(I always refer to the damage as primary fire) doesn't life steal
   It's honestly kinda dumb, I play alotta Moira when I want to swap between large amounts of healing in tight knit comps or flex out to help kill the backline or defend my other support, her lifesteal plus the auto accuracy really isn't something she should have on Primary fire.

When I'm fighting a moira one on one I'll literally stand still and just focus on my aim if I Don't have an easy escape, zero point in trying to dodge her shots so I might as well make aiming easier on myself.

Orb:
  Remove the bouncing around. Moira picks a spot, same way Ram shield works, and the Orb flies to that spot (Tagging anyone along the way for health or damage) and hovers there until its either expended its payload, or 5 seconds have passed. Orb damage has life steal (Not multiplicative of how many are being damaged)

Reasonings: Skill orb is a long standing meme, and it's annoying, both to use and face. 

If you're using it, you almost always only get some of the benefit of it unless you're tossing it right into the middle of a massive group of heavily damaged team mates or enemies. Otherwise it just passes by and then vanishes into narnia unless you're doing something niche like bouncing it straight up into the ceiling, which is funny but overall not that helpful. If you're facing it then it's basically a coin toss on it flying away after the first pass or chasing you down like a vengeful spirit and killing you through sheer luck.

Picking where it stops means you can do things like block flanks, cut off a retreat, deny an area, or with healing you can give it to a dedicated team mate, give your whole team a temp healing turret and stuff like that. I'd infinitely prefer this over the chaotic skill orb we have. More options, less random bullshit.
Giving it the lifesteal means she can retain the same extra survivability lifesteal gives her but it's not just about being within 20 meters of her now, it's about being within a few meters of the orb. Helps her a bit but also stops the whole braindead jumping into the backline because she WILL just survive until the fade cooldown is over. You can move and position a bit more with her abilities in mind.",Overwatch,1705967036.0,t3_19da6iv

If I play damage and my Elims are low even though I’m actually getting solo kills as early picks, I’m immediately bad because of it. It’s especially bad because they don’t show more detailed stats, like showing healing prevented by Ana nade or players saved, and things like Lucio speed boost are basically not accounted for at all.

Absolutely broken matchmaking in dia and the real hell of playing solo in group of 4.,"

Hello, i am an phlegmatic person but everyday i get mad with this game but usually i keep my pain in my head... today i almost lost it and smash up my pc...I play solo dps as always.  


Every day hard grinding solo hell... First game we got toxic feeding zarya, next game we have feeding widow who left and now the worst of the worst: Another match, we got diffed so much, other dps were negative kd, so between round i checked and see that they are in group, ask them if they are in one group and yes...checked the profile of other dps and boom GOLD 5...GOLD 5 in DIA match wow wow wow.   
I ask them why are they boosting him and ofc all toxic, but the problem is blizzard not them...Is this game dying? Or why they even create this caricature of competitive matches?  


I grind everyday, its so hard to play solo, also i have to play soldier or sombra or similar self-sustainable heroes to not be expecting in some kind of teamplay but what is this...ofc you can see sure its just one bad game...no its getting worse and worse...all the time toxic, one trick...i thought it will be different in diamand but tough luck. I would rather wait 10 - 15 minutes for matchmaking for 5 solo vs 5 solo than this shit.  


HM2SKY -  i was soldier, then sombra...ofc i threw and did some mistakes after realizing we are done...have fun and dont forget to write me, it was totally my fault, not the plat tank or that GOLD 5 dps (iiiiiii know its not his fault, its blizzards, but still. i told him to play counter hanzo at least..ofc he did not go anything usefull). if this was 5 SOLO VS 5 SOLO i would not get that mad, but this is just BS, big blizzard bs, that deserver another negative review on steam, yuck.

reporting system," 

The current reporting system in Overwatch 2 appears to be experiencing issues and requires significant improvement. Users are encountering account losses, some of which they have held for several years, due to seemingly innocuous statements such as expressing a preference for a specific hero or requesting role swaps. There is also concern about the occurrence of troll banning in stacks, where a group of players reports an individual who is performing well, resulting in an automatic AI ban.

Even casual comments like “Pharah, you like that headshot” during gameplay have reportedly led to bans, with the AI system flagging such interactions. The consequences extend beyond mere account suspension, as users are losing valuable in-game assets, including skins, amounting to significant financial losses. The absence of human review by game masters exacerbates the situation, as all bans are currently handled by AI without providing adequate explanations upon request.

The lack of transparency in the ban process, coupled with the absence of clear reasons for bans, raises concerns among the community. While it is understandable that severe violations, such as homophobic or racist behavior, should warrant strict consequences, the current system lacks a nuanced approach. Users are calling for a more balanced and transparent review process, urging developers to address these issues promptly and comprehensively.",Overwatch,1705948814.0,t3_19d2ttw

"All ""impossible"" support mechanics explained and simpified.","I'm sick of seeing people's saying that OW is just a world of magic and that support's skills make no sense. I may not have a degree in science or any experience in tech.

So let's get through this:

Lucio - obviously his healing isn't ""just music."" It's most likely minute nanobots that are able to enter in one's body through his or her ears and make the necessary repairs. That's also why his healing is slow and have a limited range: it's based on his weapon (the HQ device). Speed boost is the same: it enters the body to strengthen the legs and cardio.

Mercy - people say Dmg boost makes no sense. Some said that it is an enhance for the body, but this doesn't explain why projectiles like bullets are affected by it. The reality is that Mercy's blue beam casts a barrier around the body. Anything that pierces the barrier takes on an elctro-effect that strengthens it. This accounts for all attacks. 

Rez and healing would be similar. Since OW characters don't get mortally wounded, we can assume that an HP bar is only representative of their heart and when their heart gives out. Rez is simply a super-charged electric shock to reawaken the heart. 

Baptiste - his is similar to Mercy's. It doesn't ""negate dying""; it provides a barrier that repels attacks. 

Kiriko - It is more likely that Kiriko's tailsmen are actually just robotic healing-aids. We can see this in the animatic short: when she places on the old dude, it lights up and heals him. Also, her ult performs similar to lucio's, in a sense that it ""enters"" the body as a stimulant. This falls in line with Overwatch's universe's logic and explain why it wouldn't work for enemy's: Kiriko employed a special code so that it is only activated for her teammates. You might say that suzu works the same way, but it is actually realistic that suzu is just an ancient formula passed down from tradition.

Lifeweaver: how can a plant HEAL? Obviously, it functions as a repair station, where the waves emitted from the tree repairs the body.

Ana - why do some of ana's bullets heals and others heart? This is clearly because it's a smart gun: when the scop passes a target, it scans the enemy. Ana places codes on her teammates, and anyone without the code gets hurt. You may be thinking why her grenade, for that matter, can splatter both enemies and teammates at the same time. The answer is simple: it's a smart grenade. The liquid contains two states. Once it is on a person without the code, it activates a poison (the dmg for the poison negates healing) and activates a healing agent that accelerates repair functions for teammates.

Zen - don't listen to any of that magic nonsense. Zen's discords are very simple: yellow orb is a host of bots that enter the body to make repairs; purple orb is a host of bots that dispels the body's defense mechanisms, causing more weakness. 

Brig - Now HOW can HITTING someone heal? It's actually pretty simple. when the flail makes contact, it expels a healing agent that immediately seeks her teammates. The friction and energy from bashing would power the flail here so she can use it infinitely without worrying about ""charging"" the device. That's why she has to hit things.

so yeah like I said OW is not ""magic""; everything has a purpose.",Overwatch,1705948249.0,t3_19d2l8i

I really want to main one of these threes as I like their playstyles, mainly Mercy or Widowmaker but...how ? Does it get better targeting enemies ? I only realised I MUST aim the head but the shoot window feels so tiny. I even put a sticker on my screen to help me aim but it's still hard.

I hope season 9 is the beginning of big yearly updates to freshen things up,"Big balance changes, new heroes and reworks, new maps and updates to existing maps, new game modes and updates to existing game modes, battlepass improvements, new and easier ways to get and earn cosmetics, and bringing back limited time competitive modes like mystery heroes or (hot take) 2cp.

Also bringing back some old features like LFG and the general player levels. I like the new progression system but I think it just needs better icons, but there's no reason not to have general player levels from OW1 with the player border and the more indepth hero and role progression systems together. Maybe even a clan like system?

I hope Overwatch does something similar to how league of legends has yearly seasons.

Blizzard has an opportunity with season 9 to start a new year with the new matchmaking system and soft MMR reset combined with upcoming passive updates and many balance changes. It's one way to keep the game fresh and fun.

I know Blizzard has a longer timeline for the game that we don't know about, and that's okay but I thought I'd throw out some ideas to see what other people think and see if there's any worthwhile discussion around it.

Also pls just straight up delete souvenirs from the game.

Edit: Since I've been playing The Finals a bit, they have a tournament game mode where you basically play 3 matches with the final 2 teams playing against each other. I think a solo / duo queue mode  where you do something similar could be fun to find a random team and try to win the tournament over 3 matches.",Overwatch,1705940429.0,t3_19czdkh

From bronze to plat Ball experience,"After playing since launch being bronze my role career, I decided one day that I was going to get good. I always loved ball so I thought I'd use him. That, and he does pretty well without relying on his team so much.

I understand that the play experience is so much better with the chat turned off. If I turned it off, I wouldn't have seen the difference of reactions. I'm still climbing and pretty steadily.

At first, the chat reactions were flaming me because I chose ball. Before I started gaining the level of expertise with ball I have now, it was pretty hit or miss how the team would react. Primarily it was negative. 

As I started getting better and started getting win streaks, my confidence rose and my gameplay got better and better. I'm not actually at Platinum yet but I'm about to hit it for the first time. I haven't played in about a week and jumped on before I started my day. I played 4 games and won 4 games. It is extremely rewarding hearing my team congratulate me on actually playing ball well. With balls reputation as the worst tank in the game, I like this versus how it used to be when I just sucked.

What is funny now is now I get the opposing team chat coming in about how the ball player has no life or doesn't shower LOL. I think this is just funny. As ball, I love to fire back against toxicity with positivity because it it's a kind of troll move if you think about it.  It also earns me more endorsements. 

For once in my overwatch career, I'm doing pretty well.",Overwatch,1705933006.0,t3_19cwm0x

Tanks are not the leader of a team,I notice a lot of the time that teams tend to gather around their tank even they’re not performing well. And tanks themselves except their team to be behind them at all time. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve  noticed the tank leading their team to defeat whether that’s being stuck at a choke or not using multiple routes to get to the objective. Instead of the other 4 players taking autonomy and making plays to make it easier for the team they just stand and shoot where their tank is not contributing whatsoever to their victory. And honestly it’s frustrating when you want to tell your teammates that they should follow you or at least spread out just because most players are more inclined to follow rather than lead or at least play their own game.

Cuz I've been trying to play ow for three days now and every match has been the worst experience of my LIFE no matter what role I play or if I don't try or try too hard it keeps putting me in matches with worse and worse players while I keep having to go up against gms

What am I supposed to do I love ow but these queues are horrible it's just not a fun experience if nothing is dying and it ends up with everyone on my team having 3-4 kills while the enemy has 30+ how do I have fun on a game I love if this is how every match keeps going",Overwatch,1705886902.0,t3_19cjpza

What are you guys' thoughts on the patch notes released on January 9th?,I made a video on this specific set of patch notes and my reactions to it but i wanted to hear the subreddits thoughts as well before i reupload my video tomorrow evening.,Overwatch,1705885671.0,t3_19cjamc
Do you think roles have lost their identities?,"I was watching a video from an OW content creator about the next changes on S9 (the DPS and Tank self healing), and while writing a reply that thought crossed my mind.

Supports passed from giving some kind of utility (movement, damage, making easier to kill enemies, heal block, etc) to be healing machines that can easily duel other heroes; having abilities that are broken or useless depending on the patch, and in general, not giving to your team more than a small gimmick. I mean, I understand you either be able to defend yourself or die, but then what's the point of being a support just because you can heal if heroes like Hanzo or Sombra can support better the team than you. We became so dependant on healing that, in ranks under master (were almost all of players are), supports can't do nothing but healing because either their team dies or they report them for not being useful enough or the other case, supports are so busted you can't destroy a team without giving more to your team than kills.

Tanks passed from crowd-control and taking space from their team to be dps with huge health pools that either they're unkillable killing machines or they're useless because they don't have the tools a DPS has to escape or kill. And now that there's only one tank, tank play summarizes in counterplaying the other tank rather than trying to enable your teammates to do their stuff.

Even DPS have been hit hard because they're supposed to secure kills, but they have lost the tools to do that via burst damage being nerfed and healing being so busted, and the other roles being able to kill as much as a dps can. The ones that are viable is because ironically, they have support tools and/or reliable ways to kill. 

I have to say, I've been playing since year 2 of OW1, and at that time, I was mainly a tank player (now I only play support), and while I can understand a lot of people prefer the way the game is now, I miss the times playing a role implied you had to commit to play in a way that maybe makes you don't kill that much but enabling your teammates to shine.

How do comp points per rank work??,"I'm seeing a ton of different things on the internet about how comp points work.  I know it's 25 per win and i think 15 per draw, but how many comp points do you get per rank at the end of the season?

Anyone know how the open queue ranked system works ?,"Recently my friends and I decided that it could be funny to play open queue ranked. To put to perspective we are metal rank players in role queue somewhere around silver and gold. 

First game we are gold 1, so we don't mind then we go plat even though we lost in gold. And for some reason the more we played the higher the rank was. We got from gold 1 games to games going as high as diamond 5. And the worst part is that we got our asses clapped in those games we were powerless. 

And still after 14 games with a 5-9 ratio with 1 gold game 3 diamond games and the rest being plat games I ended up diamond 5 with one of my friends the other being plat 1. And two others not having enough wins (we didn't always played with each other) 

I mean I'm grateful for the free competitive points but I'm really confused. Keep in mind it was our first time playing in open queue ranked. And we're not supposed to be that high. 

So I was wondering if anyone knew what's going on here",Overwatch,1705879101.0,t3_19cgxko
A design for a Dominican Tank named ‘Vera’ I made. Tell me what you think!,"Vera is designed to be a more lightweight dive/brawl tank, getting in an out of fights simply but strategically and dealing high and consistent values of damage.

From a visual design point, the image in the post is a simple group of them I put together. He is designed to resemble a character within the show ‘mr robot’ known as ‘Vera’ who I’ve always loved so I supposed this is a sort of passion project in that regard. He is physically leaner and smaller than the other tanks, however his large cannon makes up the majority of his physicality. He is muscular and has los muertos patterning all over him, of which glow brighter in dark areas.

His background and backstory is interesting and unique, especially his interactions with Sombra of which he has an obsessive admiration over, although Sombra while emotional is intelligent enough to overcome his manipulative nature. He is a Dominican refugee who immigrated to Mexico after being forced out of his home by the Omnic crisis. He founded the Los Muertos gang which saw widespread interest from many orphaned Mexicans and victims of the omnic crisis who were vengeful of those responsible, causing it to rapidly grow. He took in Sombra as one of his closest and most valuable members, giving her things such as food, shelter and even a stuffed bear to gain her trust. Vera took advantage of Sombra and her skills, leaving Sombra with paranoia and a hatred towards Vera when she joined talon. Vera encourages Sombra to join back due to how much she provided for the gang, however both of them know the answer will always be never. Vera is very emotional and also mentally fragile and unstable which we see in his voice lines. He is also remorseless when killing the rest of the cast in game (except Sombra) especially towards omnics and talon members 

From a gameplay perspective, Vera is good at poking out single targets from range, but shines at rapidly diving enemies and strategically setting up shock mines around the map in order to move around easier. Reflective of his personality, Vera very much plays like a glass cannon, dealing consistent and high damage but relying on movement and one ability to get out of situations. His ultimate is best used for area denial or finishing off small groups of squishes.

QP confusion,"My PC died on me so I picked up OW2 on my Xbox since my account stuff carries over now. Last time I did rank (support) on console over a year ago I was gold. 

Recently in QP I’m finding that I am getting grouped with anyone from gold to GM. The last few games I’ve played today had diamond and master dps and tanks, at least for the profiles I can view. I’ve been looking because I can tell the skill ceiling is much higher in a lot of these games. Or a few players are steam rolling. 

Is this just a normal thing for console queue? To have such disparity between ranks in QP? Is it an mmr thing where it’s placing me with higher ranks due to like a win streak or something?

Endorsement level used as a metric for toxicity and performance.,"Ok, Ik, the title sounds way too serious/pretentious, lol, but I didn't know how to phrase to make it sound clear and not ranty. 

Well, since the beggining the endorsement system has been kind of a community barometer to identify toxic/positive players (Level 1 toxic, Level 4 positive), ofc it's not accurate because there are several variables involved like the decay caused for not playing or leaving matches,  and, at some degree, the positive bias towards supports after a good match. That doesn't mean that anybody with Level 1 is toxic, maybe is just somebody that took a break or mains a hated hero, but even so I think the system can give you a rough idea of what kind of players you have on your team.

That's about the social part, but can the system also tell us something about the potential performance of a player? I have my own experience and bias regarding endorsement level and match performance, for example, in QP I've noticed that people above level 3 normally play ""poorly"" (didn't know how to call it without being rude, sorry) and seems to stay out of ranked, with level 5 being the most notable examples; in ranked it's more of a mixed bag, I don't remember seeing many people with level 4, but I've been playing mostly QP lately so it's hard to tell for me if the same happens there. 

Again, this is a completely personal and, most likely, skewed perception, it's not meant to be a rant or to call out any kind of player, I just would like to read what do you think about the system because I really think it can give us some additional info about the player base.",Overwatch,1705867438.0,t3_19ccafb

Has the QP matchmaking always been this horrible?,"I’ve been solo queuing quick play over the past week and the experience has been downright abysmal. This is a fairly new account (roughly 50 hours) that I didn’t even play ranked on. Btw I’ve always solo q’d on this account, never stacked. 

Listen, I absolutely do not care about wins or losses in qp because I play for fun and try different things. However the matchmaking seems so horribly wonky that it’s starting to remove any enjoyment.

Overall I’ve won 20% of my games the past week. I’m talking stomp after stomp, 15 streak losses. I’ve been playing for 3 years and this has never happened to me. It always seems like my team is playing for the first time and is completely lost. I typically have the strongest stats (I play all roles) and my team goes 3-0-11. Unless I hard carry every single game we will literally get spawn camped. Let me clarify, I don’t care if my team are noobs! But stop constantly putting these people against doped up Genjis and insane Junkerqueens. 


The enemy counterpicks almost instantly and plays with OWL level synergy. Why does it feel like for someone who is solo queuing I’m going against stacks? I understand the MMR system for qp is much more volatile and I don’t mind going against teams way better than mine every now and then, as long as it’s all even. However an entire week of sweaty team after sweaty team while I solo q? 

My DPS is on Junkrat? You better believe they’ll come out with Pharmercy or Echomercy. The counterswapping culture has infected quick play and is making the game so unfun and boring. Neither tank sticks with one hero for more than 3 minutes, it’s so ridiculous. 

I can hold my own and pose some threat to the enemy team but I don’t want to sweat my ass off, I want to relax! I don’t want to play Ana or Zen because enemy Hog keeps yeeting my Brig off the map 8 times (yes this happened in one game!). I don’t want to play Widowmaker because the enemy Widow keeps taking everyone’s heads while they walk in a straight line on Circuit.

Why does it feel like people are treating qp like it’s ranked? Instant counter picks, unnecessary toxicity and everyone seems sooooo miserable. It’s like these people can only have fun if they win. Have people stopped playing ranked and now coming to qp in droves to stomp on noobs? Because it certainly feels like it. When I’m on the winning side and stomp the opposition it doesn’t feel fun either because it’s clear they never stood a chance. 

I play qp to unwind and not take myself seriously. But it really feels like people take themselves VERY seriously. 

Hell I started playing ranked on this account because the matchmaking unironically seems better. Wtf is going on with this game?",Overwatch,1705866558.0,t3_19cbxol

"Please someone explain to me(who preferably also mains tank), how orisa is not broken?","I play tank mostly at the moment and man is Orisa so fucking annoying. Combine that bitch with an ana and lifeweaver? Yeah that motherfucker is not going down. Like at all. An orisa that can time their CD well is literally invincible. My point is there is no tank that can actively counter her well. I guess zarya to a degree but even then, everything has to go right.  Im in diamond on PC btw. But yeah before I never really cared what the other tank plays but anytime you feel like you got a good chance to win the match, an Orisa comes walking out of spawn.   


Sick and tired of OW making the most braindead, easy to play characters the best. Like reaper?? Last night i played against 3 teams of Orisa and reaper in a row. How tf am I supposed to do anything as ANY tank when my team refuses to switch to anything meaningful. I had a mercy yesterday pocketing a 2-6 soldier with 2k damage after we defended on payload. And this bitch was telling me that I am the problem???

Self-heal is necessary to make up for the removal of 6v6,"With 6v6, DMG was able to be spread around. With the removal of 1 tank, squishes were going to get targeted, pressure was going to rank up, and one small mistake by a person would be able to cost a game. Less mistakes could be made, which, of course, is good in a sense (because then bad fundamentals will be necessarily punished), but this means if you suck (and since most of us are not in Masters, we pretty much suck), you could cost your teams a lot of games, just as much as any of your other teammates can. The removal of 6v6 really was detrimental for the game. I think self-heal will change that. 

I play a lot of support, mainly Kiriko, Moira, and Mercy. Although these are low-skilled characters, I’ve found that they have an incredible ability to survive, which is only enhanced by the self-heal. Without the self-heal, I’m not sure they would be playable. There would be too much pressure on supports to heal supports. With how easy it is to die now in OW2, self-heal was a necessary component to keep people playing support. It’s become apparent that self-heal will be necessary to keep people playing at all. 

Finally being able to get some independence from the horrible team-dependency this game puts in you is something I look forward to, both for those people that are affected by *my* bad games, as well as for people that will find the independence liberating. It feels similar to the addition of role-queues, which was also a necessary must for the game. Looking forward to seeing how self-heal plays out.",Overwatch,1705861409.0,t3_19c9vlb

Rate of fire buff: 1 fully charged shot every 0.75 seconds

This keeps his DPS the same but removes headshots against 200 HP targets 

Sonic arrow buff: characters lit up by Sonic take +50% damage from Hanzo's base arrows.

So he can do 270 headshot damage when shooting a soniced target. This rewards the cool setup of getting a sonic and preparing your shot.

overwatch needs more movement abilities - rant,"reaper, sombra, genji, soldier, rein and lucio are all really fun to play.

sym, zarya, lifeweaver, ana, bap and mei all make me crave death whenever i play mystery heroes.

this might just be me, but im not a fan of walking towards an objective to heal my dumbass teammate on point who for some reason thinks i can heal through walls, only for my max speed to be about 2 miles per decade. im not saying every character needs wall running or boosts, im saying why the fuck are soldier, lucio and sombra the only people who figured out the ability to run? i don't think everyone should have the run ability, like tanks for the most part should be slow, tracer is fast enough without it, and bastion feels like he shouldn't be able to either. just let me run goddammit.

genji is pretty fast with dash, and wallclimbing can give you shortcuts to save time. rein has charge, which now since it can be cancelled you can just slide right into battle and put up shield mid charge. reaper can teleport and go ghost even if the TP does require me to schedule an appointment beforehand cus jesus christ hurry up. 

zarya runs about the same speed as a turtle with a missing leg. bap can jump up to high areas but honestly if i can just change that to the shit illari has i'll take it. ana is the most lore accurate cus i actually feel like im playing as an elderly woman with a broken hip. lifeweaver is the fucking worst offender, cus the amount of times i for some reason think im playing lucio and go to speedboost, only to pull my teammate back so we have to slowly walk together is more times than i want to admit. sym is the only one mentioned in the second section who has a movement ability that can move you forward, but it moves you across such a short distance that honestly you are better off walking it. oh and mei? yeah fuck mei. genuinely idk how people play as mei or sym and have fun, i personally enjoy playing my games but apparently experiencing the gameplay is not for everyone. JUST GIVE ME A FUCKING ICE SLIDE ABILITY, IVE NEVER USED WALL ONCE IN MY ENTIRE TIME PLAYING MYSTERY HEROES, JUST LET ME FROZONE THIS BITCH AND HAVE FUN.

for all the hate pharah gets, and for the hate echo has dodges despite being objectively more annoying than pharah, they are fun to play. if you have good aim then you can pretty easily take them out, but both are still really fun. echo can stay in the air longer than the fucking clouds themselves, while pharah can get across the map really quickly with both her abilities used together. just use knockback on yourself while exiting spawn, and use rocket boost right as the knockback hits, congrats you have just made it halfway to point.

i hate playing defense solely cus of the fact that if i die, which btw yes i fully am aware it is a skill issue when i die, you have to walk the entire width of russia just to go back to the fight. nothing says gameplay like walking for ten hours. i know its not even that gamemodes fault but honestly if i didn't consider it a dick move i would just let the enemy team move the payload up further just so i could actually play the game. this can all be fixed with more movement abilities.

people will say high mobility characters are annoying to fight, which i respond with the fact that if everyone is highly mobile then it will be more balanced. some people will also say that this could make some characters broken, i respond with this list of every fuck i give about that information:

I think I saw a streamer shooting it off at about 40 or 45, I can't remember exactly, and would charge it to max if there was down time and thought damage was going to be coming in soon.

Should I just give up on DPS and only play tank?,"I've jumped around DPS mains for awhile before discovering I do like playing Sombra a lot more than others, but I'm really kinda bad on basically any DPS hero and usually get obliterated rather quickly, die in dumb ways and get low damage numbers.

I'm like 10 times more effective on tank, I get good damage, usually a lot of mit too, and I just generally do decent as a tank. I'd say overall I'm a tank main.

I'm kinda ok on support but don't really care about playing support.

I like playing dps when I'm able to actually do things, but most of the time I feel kinda useless and don't feel like I have much effect on the match.

2 (3?) Improvements for Rein to add skill expression for higher ranks,"1. Make charge consistent. That's an obvious, low effort one. I know left side scoops right side boops... But even then I'm booping people with my center and left, so it doesn't make much sense sometimes.

2. Add a quick melee hitbox (30 damage, 2 meter range) to firestrike. This will allow him to deal slightly more damage to tanks deep in his face, which he is strangely bad at, and will add a way of targetting individual Squishies in a way that is more skillful (and committal) than a hammer swing. A melee firestrike on someone that is WAY too close + a hammer swing would then do 215 damage.

3. This one is more experimental, so a hard maybe. But... Reduce his shield maximum to 1200 (making it bigger just makes it take longer to recharge anyway) and make it so whenever firestrike hits then the shield recharges for 100. This would reward him for good firestrikes against multiple enemies in an additional way, and add more skill expression to Rein's shielding.",Overwatch,1705827612.0,t3_19bza66

"Which hero do you think is the most poorly designed, unhealthy character for the game?","Having one shots in a game like Overwatch where healing damage dealt to your teammates is an essential part of the game is unhealthy. Widowmaker’s primary is a sniper rifle that can do 300 damage with a headshot up to a certain range (forgot the exact range but I think it was 40m), meaning that she always has the ability to one shot. Insta killing people removes the threat of your damage getting healed (except for mercy who can rez 1-2 times a fight).

In a 5v5 format, being down a teammate is detrimental and more often than not, leads to you losing the fight. Widow has ample opportunity to instantly remove someone from the fight with little risk because she’s a long range character.

This is just my opinion and I would be glad to hear all of yours.",Overwatch,1705825500.0,t3_19bys31

So.. is QP just Comp-Lite now or what?,"Probably gonna get flamed, but the leaver penalties are harsh. They almost make QP feel like comp, in that if you leave, you can’t queue again! Wasn’t that the point of QP? To be able to have the freedom to not play comp, and to be able to leave a game after burning out? 

If you play 5 consecutive games on QP, and you start fizzling out at game 3, per say, you *dont* and *shouldnt* have to stay in the game , esp if doing so will weaken and hurt your team. Leaving can give a chance to get better players to fill, but that is limited now. 

If you play 5 consecutive games in comp, you have to play 5 consecutive games no matter what, ***as it should be***.

WHY implement these types of restrictions which can only cause frustration? Hoping they add something like what QP used to be in arcade because as of now, QP does not feel like QP.

"Help! I don't know how this is possible, but I think I'm stuck in elo hell but in quick play","Hi guys, I don't know if anyone experienced this before, but I've been consistently having < 30% winrate on Quick Play for the last 4\~ weeks.

Me and 2 friends play together almost exclusively, and we only play for fun, on quick play, not sweating, and we are very okay with losing. However we don't just throw every game, we do try to win, almost always.

All 3 of us were overwatch 1 players and we stopped playing overwatch 2 around season 1 and we came back this season. This problem has been happening since we returned to the game.

We know that there is a hidden MMR on QP. So I was under the assumption that, even if we were straight up throwing every game, which we aren't, if we lose enough, the matchmaking would eventually match us with people that are enough low level for us to have a fair fight, but apparently I was wrong.

Today we beat our record of worst session ever, with a 10% winrate ([lost 9 games and won 1](https://imgur.com/c2dzhvt)). But I do have to point out that today was kind of a ""bad day"" because I tried new heroes that I normally don't play (so yeah, it's on me this time). As we lost more and more I switched to heroes that I am more comfortable with but it didn't make a difference. On average a ""common"" winrate for us would be around 25%.

One of the friends in the trio plays ranked without us (and he is Silver). Me and the third friend don't play ranked. But I assume we all would have similar ranks if we did play it. I was gold (support) in overwatch 1 but I really don't think I'm playing as well as then, so silver is a very fair ranking for me, if not lower.

We are bad at the game but we keep on getting matched with far better players, and that doesn't make sense. People get mad sometimes and tell me I'm bad, and I really don't know what to say to them, the problem is the matchmaking, I can't simply summon the spirit of SuperTF to bully me into playing better.

We are ok with losing, but damn, 10% winrate is hard to overlook (specially when I need to win 35 games to get the heroes I missed).

I came here asking for help but actually just kinda wanted to vent. I hope someone could give me a light on theories of what could be causing this, and how to fix it, if it is at all possible. Is this whole scenario eligible as a ticket for customer support?

Do we really need to move our fun to the ladder just to not feel as bad?

I'll end this with the sentence that became my catchphrase: ""This matchmaking is a joke"".

I hope they also adjust the QP matchmaking when revamping the competitive next season.",Overwatch,1705809834.0,t3_19bukx6

Critical Hit Multiplier,"Hey y’all! I wanted to start a new discussion about a topic I've thought about recently and wanted to ask about in depth (including *all* heroes, not just a specific one). This is purely for fun and to see what thoughts this can provoke! So here we go:

Most heroes who are able to obtain critical hits have a 2x multiplier; 26 of the 39 heroes to be exact (Sojourn (primary) and Widow (secondary) inclusive). It's clear this was the original concept with the launch of OW1, but since then, we now have 5 outlier heroes: Widowmaker (primary) and Kiriko with 2.5x and Roadhog, Illari, and Sojourn (secondary) with 1.5x. 

Something of note here is that Widow, Roadhog, and Sojourn all *released* with a 2x multiplier and have since been adjusted to their current ones, all for different reasons. Illari and Kiriko are the only two heroes who debuted with unique multipliers, though Kiriko's has *also* been modified since her release. 

**What are your thoughts on more heroes having varied/unique critical multipliers?** Not to only consider the multiplier itself, but to also consider modifying base damage—and if you'd like think in an even deeper aspect—fire rates, ammo capacity, spreads, etc. **Which heroes do you think would benefit from this and could potentially improve the feel of gameplay for both sides of a lobby? Is the common 2x multiplier relied on too heavily or should it be more enforced (i.e. bring outlier heroes to match the 2x multiplier)?**

I'm really curious to see what thoughts y'all have! :) I'll eventually put some of my own input in the replies, but want to hear others' opinions first.

*Note: the 10 heroes that do not have critical hit multipliers (for this post's purpose) fit under 3 other categories that I'll deem* ***Melee*** *(Brig and Rein),* ***Constant*** *(Moira, Winston, and Ana), and* ***Splash*** *(Junkrat, Pharah and Sigma). Symmetra and Zarya would both be considered Constant and Splash. These are balanced slightly differently than all other heroes. For example, all Splash heroes have different direct to splash damage ratios, and this shows that value variance is common. I could go into the numbers too, but all of those are on the Wiki and would be redundant for me to repeat here.*",Overwatch,1705797300.0,t3_19bqjmc

Been playing him since overwatch 1 and he truly feels worse than he ever has. His damage is so pitifully low even when utilizing every aspect of his kit, not to mention his guns themselves have tiny magazine size, super long reload, and awful spread. 

Legitimately feels like he's been left in overwatch 1 - I love this hero and yet there's effectively no reason to pick him. His damage is awful, his team utility is awful, his ultimate is awful, his counters are brain dead easy to utilize. Seems telling that even the best ball main around won't play him anymore.

anyone else feel like torbjorn needs a rework?,"I feel like his turret is the only reason you'd pick him over someone else who can spam down mid. torbjorn is supposed to be some crazy smart engineer and all that really happens is he has one tiny turret that he throws down. any other thing he has is vaguely tied to engineering or not at all. like think about how interesting the engineer is in tf2. his whole schlick IS tending to his mechanics and builds. 

sym feels more of an engineer than than torb is, which is sad. with torb it feels like he has a turret just as an afterthought even though they're allegedly torbs life work and passion. ow is no stranger to taking from tf2 for ideas so screw it, why not just take a dispenser thing for his teammates that only gives out ammo and make his sentry more interesting like ow1? I don't know why they got rid of that. 

his ultimate seems super uninspired as well. I get he is a defense hero but again, why not have him be able to throw down a second turret that has lots of health and is very powerful? that'd be more powerful than lava on the floor honestly. and interesting on top",Overwatch,1705780747.0,t3_19bkd71

Why do supports have immediate beef with their dps," 

Supports are either gods or have don't have peripheral vision.

I main dps(Ashe, Echo Sojurn)I've noticed that supports I play with will almost always prioritize tank over dps. At face value it makes sense(something about Tank --> Fellow support --> DPS) but my tank could be near or at max health and I could be next to my supports on life support begging for heals but our supports will be so locked into not letting our tank a lick of damage that they'll forget I exist or just flat out ignore me. Now I COULD press X and ask for heals but if I press it one too many times I get yelled at.

My question is: Is there a reason why supports healbot tanks and then blame dps instead of trying to understand what the problems are(doesn't mean the dps AREN'T lacking but it goes both ways.)",Overwatch,1705767563.0,t3_19bfbmv

The game struggles even at 720p low settings, with FPS fluctuating from 60 down to 15/20/30 in a matter of seconds, 0 stability at all. What could cause this issue? Is there any way the system might not be actually using ram in dual channel configuration? Is that any way to check that?

In almost every qp match where Im doing good, at least 2 people on the enemy team swaps to soft counters, like mei, moria, phara, etc. In my 13 games of comp there I saw significantly less counter swapping. Maybe one person from the enemy team swapped but it wasn’t impactful to the game whatsoever.

Lifeweaver tips,"Over 50 hours on Lifeweaver, these are all my tips and tricks I use while playing him! 

• use his platform to nullify Ashe’s dynamite. The platform usually absorbs the blast

• use his platform to block doorways and stairs—this really only applies when you’re trying to block enemies off

• use his platform to detect enemies. Sometimes when I’m healing the dps like to flank me. I place my platform behind me so they’ll have to trigger it to get to me (warning me of their presence). 

• use his tree similar to Mei’s wall (to block DVA bomb, block rein charge, block JQ ult, separate my team from the enemies in general 

• lifegrip teammates with no mobility to help get them into position or closer to the team if they had to respawn (Ana…)

• lift up souls with his platform to allow Mercy to safely rez 

• use his platform to lift up enemy orisa and reaper when they’re ulting

• use his platform to lift slept teammates, frozen teammates, and rein shattered teammates

• lifegrip teammates into tracer bombs

Genji Powershift Idea,"I was hoping this would get some traction and an idea we could try, but can we powershift genji to allow him to be a more well-rounded hero that will be more useful to his teams, instead of being overly dependent on a two ult combo every 2-3 min to jsut be of use? I thought of something like this by giving him a similar treatment to hanzo where he can be more self-reliant:  


Shuriken Damage increased from 27 to 29  
Dragonblade Damage increased from 110 to 125.  
While Dragonblade is active, damage boost will no longer be applied.   


Something like this I believe will make him a healthier character and not being so overly dependent on the two ult combo just to win games. Agree, Disagree, or any other ideas you may have?

Stand up and fight,"As a Reaper main in Overwatch 2, I, like many others, have been put through a lot. Reaper has had his fair share of ups and downs in Overwatch's history, but this latest round of nerfs to his ""lucky color"" voice line is too much.

We Reaper mains are a unique breed. We are the silent assassin types, the ones who lurk in the shadows and come out to strike at the most opportune moment. We are the ones who take the time to learn the ins and outs of our character, perfect our skills, and create an atmosphere of fear when we enter the battlefield.

But now, with the nerfs to our voice line, we are being silenced, pushed aside, and treated as though we don't matter. We have been relegated to the background, and treated as though we are not integral to team success. This is a travesty, and we will not stand for it.

Reaper mains, it's time to rise up! It's time to show the world that we are a force to be reckoned with. It's time to demonstrate that even without our ""lucky color"" voice line, we are powerful, intelligent, and capable of anything.

It's time to let our shotguns do the talking. It's time to show the world what we're made of. It's time to show the Overwatch community and Blizzard that we will not be silenced, that we are not to be ignored, and that we are not to be taken lightly.

Reaper mains, it's time to show the world who we really are—the dark, mysterious, destructive force that lives on the edges of the battlefield, waiting patiently, biding our time, until the moment is right to strike.

Stand with me, Reaper mains. Stand tall, hold your shotguns high, and show the world that we will not be silenced, that we will not be ignored, and that we will not be defeated. We are Reaper mains, and we are here to stay!",Overwatch,1705722194.0,t3_19b2ho5

Dealing with way too many leavers in Competitive.,"I love logging on to what used to be my favorite game just for my first match of the day to go like this.

I don’t even understand why, we did pretty good the first round. We pushed to 3 with 1:48 left. But as soon as the enemy got to the first checkpoint, the other support left. Then the dominos kept falling as the game went on.

It feels like too many of my matches have been going like this recently. People leaving as soon as the fight becomes a little more difficult it seems. Definitely feels impossible to rank up.

Side note, I really dislike how payload comp games can go to up to 4 rounds sometimes. Feels so long it becomes unfun. Especially when this is the way the match goes.

Settings Menu is Frustrating,"I've only played for about a year, so I'm just now learning the finnicky rules of the Settings menu. Here's a rant of some design choices that grind my gears:

1. If you change a setting so it's the same as all-heroes, it loses the asterisk. But if you change all-heroes, it still remembers that setting was edited in the past and doesn't update those, and there's no indicator for this.
2. Delete Override is the button to do what you wanted to do in #1. But it changes ALL the settings, for ALL tabs, for ALL heroes: options, keybindings, sensitivities, reticles, etc.
3. If you want to change a setting back to its default, same thing: all settings, all tabs, all heroes (at least I think so, I'm too scared to press it)
4. There is no way to ""delete override"" or ""return to default"" for a single setting. If you really want to do it, you'd need to screenshot all your asterisked settings for every hero, Delete Override, and manually change back all the hero-specific settings, sliders, hotkeys, and reticles. The shorter way is actually to go through every hero and change the hotkey, maybe taking a screenshot of what the setting is for All Heroes and have it open on a second monitor (I'm in the process of doing this for the voiceline shortcuts, which I use numpad for).
5. Delete Override is a dangerous button to press. It's right next to the most frequently pressed button in the menus. There is no confirmation when you click it, it erases your settings for all heroes instantly.
6. In replays, the hotkeys to operate the free camera are not shown in the settings, you just have to know it's WASD to track/raise and mouse to pan/tilt. But the mouse controls don't even work until you press N to close the timeline. And there is no hotkey (that I know of) to move the camera forward with the payload; you have to pan 90 degrees and crab-walk the camera forwards.
7. In S7, the Tab button didn't function during POTG because it interfered with the Endorse menu. But after changing Scoreboard to a different key, there are times when the Scoreboard is hard-coded to use Tab, like when waiting to respawn or in the hero-select phase. But I'll let this slide because it's probably an actual bug.
8. Bit of a tangent, since most people use the default setting of having their profile hidden, just grey-out the ""View Profile"" option if they do, instead of having to open it just to see if it's there. Same with inviting someone to your group if they're in another group already.",Overwatch,1705705363.0,t3_19awjac

Should Damage and Healing Numbers be Removed From Scoreboard?,"Mostly the headline.

I think it would be a major quality of life upgrade and there aren’t many positives to keeping them on the scoreboard.

I feel like it only causes division and frustration having the damage and healing numbers on the main scoreboard.

It might be there because it would feel a little empty.

But I don’t think it actually provides much insight in a positive way.

If people want to find someone to blame their loss to they’ll yell at the person with the lowest damage or support with lowest healing.

And people who seem to understand the game at a high level pay almost no attention to those numbers.

(Not saying I understand it at all high level, I just know not to yell at people based on healing and dmg stats)

I’m not saying remove those numbers from the game, they should still be in your personal stats.

I just think it causes way more problems than it helps and would maybe make the game a better place.

Especially with the devs saying they are trying to make the game less crappy if you’re team isn’t working together,

I have watched coaching videos and streamers for hours and hours. It’s getting frustrating. Is anyone else like this? Am I just mentally blocked from improvement? Should I stop swapping heroes?

Streamers: A Positivity Segment,"Got a blip on my reddit feed from Overwatch TMZ, and the post was created specifically to crap on streamers.  So insert lots of name calling and insulting of mostly big name streamers, a few small timers.  Including one reply saying that streamer X was just disgusting to even look at.

So, with that in mind, I want to do a bit where instead of saying the worst parts of streamer culture, we talk about what we *like* about out favorite streamers, be it big or small.

For myself, I only have a few that I tune into consistently.  The two biggest are Flats and Emongg.  And keeping it to the positive, Flats does have a deep understanding of the game and a lot of good insight.  While he focuses on things relevant to top players, his takes are still generally on point and he has a good sense of balance.  If you want information on the game, he probably has it.

Emongg is just a positive guy.  I mean, enough said.  He's nearly always chill, respectful, and just upbeat and positive, in addition to game knowledge.  My favorite quote is ""Alright, let's go Dva"" when another tank isn't working for him.

I've tuned into Jay3 a few times because his being over the top is amusing at times, and if I'm in the right mood his commentary on patches etc can hit just right.

KarQ I don't do as much anymore, but also a generally respectful guy with informative takes, and makes the effort to consider higher and lower tiers of play when he says things.

Last couple, I came across Kitdy a while ago.  Not usually on when I'm up to watch or listen to streams, but every time I've been on she's had a very upbeat and engaging presence.  Makes you feel like you are actually part of the conversation.

Same basically goes for Deemzies from The Omnic Post.  This guy is basically in the heart of the player base in terms of takes and skills.  He's not a top player, he's not a bottom player.  His takes are relevant to the mass of the player base, he loves to chat and engage, and he is very upbeat.  When I'm not just listening to a streamer for my background noise and I actually want to engage, this guy is my go-to.

So, who are youre favorite streamers and why?  Please keep it all to the positive side and if you have a complaint about a streamer... .[https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchTMZ/comments/199lvyw/which\_streamers\_do\_you\_dislike/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchTMZ/comments/199lvyw/which_streamers_do_you_dislike/)   There's already a thread for you, go there, not here.",Overwatch,1705684769.0,t3_19aoa8k

"Making a case for Quicker Play: It's not perfect, but at least hear me out","TL;DR at the end

I found that it did a few things really well, most of which was cutting out ""downtime / wait-time"" for lots of different interactions, and increasing the value of playing together as a proper team. Was it supremely perfect out of the box? Absolutely not, but few things are. 

I'm not an expert, but I have close to 1k hours in this game and I feel like the community backlash was overblown. It does play differently than normal QP, and does require that players make some adjustments in their approach, and if there's one thing people seem to hate, it's changing their understanding of something.

----

**Respawn times** 

* A single early pick is more likely to be able to rejoin a team-fight before the rest of the team starts to go down, and it becomes a staggered mess, reducing the ""wait around to group up again"" phase. 
* It also means that losing one or two people isn't an immediate death sentence, if the remainder can scrap on the point long enough for their team to come back
* If you get half your team down, it's less waiting for the stragglers to die and respawn so you can group and push again. 
* Your team is more likely to actually wait and group up when it only takes about 4 seconds at most. 
* When you *do* have that one guy that runs off and dies alone, there's a greater chance that they respawn with other teammates  and get shepherded back into the team-play / objective
* Your own respawn is short enough that you ""stay in the game"" more mentally. I personally have ADHD, and would often alt-tab out, or take a bit or two from a snack, or do something that mentally disconnected me from the game while waiting to respawn. You can't really do that anymore with the combination of shortened times and grouped timers. For me this was a big help in keeping up the energy and momentum. 


**Team Play** 

* I found the urgency that was created by things being sped up, lead to better and more cohesive teamplay on average. You *have to* play the objectives, or they just go up in smoke. A lot of the ""roll-or-be-rolled"" feeling was when you had groups that weren't playing cohesively. 
* It also felt like you don't have to wait for your team to ""wake up"" in the last 45 seconds as often, because there's already some urgency to it. There isn't time to fart around by themselves way out of position and die 4 times, you have to participate *now*
* Team-Fights are where the excitement is for me, and there were way more 5v5 fights than with regular QP.


**General ""Immersion"" and game-feel**

* With the greater emphasis on playing the objectives as a team, it felt like there was a refreshed ""purpose"" to the objectives again (especially for escort). It feels like you have to get this thing out of here before the bad-guys get their hands on it, and they're really going to try, because they have a small window to do it (because urgency). It feels more like you're dealing with an actual heist, rather than taking a truck for a walk. 
* Team plays feel more impactful, like you are a crack squad of specialist that were brought together to get shit done; like a well oiled machine. In comparison, regular quickplay feels like a bunch of hero-jerks that think they're hot shit, trying to lone-wolf their way through a problem.  
* Enemy respawns feel like reinforcements that were called in to actually sand-bag you, and take back the building/cargo/whatever. 
* If the point flips in overtime, it's much faster to take it from 0 to 100%, and your games don't drag out forever.
* Teammates (and myself) were much more likely to use their ultimate abilities, rather than sitting on them and waiting for ""the right time"" that never comes, keeping the tempo of the game up. 
* Losing doesn't sting so much when the games are short, and winning feels more rewarding with the increased emphasis on teamplay and working together to a common end. 


----

**Common Criticisms:**

* *Not enough time to switch* -- I think there could be certainly be some tweaks to Ult-charge retention that would make it less punishing to swap off of a struggling hero when you have high/full ultimate charge. If a hero isn't working out well, I think players will have to get used to committing to a change sooner, rather than trying to make it work the whole game, and then swapping in the last 45 seconds (see previous points). 
* *It's more queue time and less gameplay* -- I'm personally a healer main, and my numbers were as high (and even higher in a few matches) than regular QP games, because of greater amount of time actually playing the objectives with my team. By also cutting out the waiting-around part of the gameplay, I found it to be more ""action-per-minute"" once you're in the match. 
* *It ends too soon / There are only 2 or 3 team fights before it's over* -- For me this comes back to the immersion discussion, where the fights feel like they *actually matter*, and your team needs to work together to get through it. If you fail, the team respawns quickly, and you can all get back in there to try again sooner. If your team isn't working together well, then at least the whole match is over faster and you can move on, instead of being dragged through an extended, terrible match. Additionally queue times would reduce a little bit overall, as matches are shorter and players are available for match-making again sooner. 

----
**My own feedback**

* The speeds could be tweaked with more consideration to the game-mode/map you are playing. 
* They could make some adjustments to respawn times, with some consideration for overtime mixed in there (mostly to prevent infinite trickling overtime)
* Adjustments to Ult-charge retention when changing characters to make it a little less punishing to swap, given the shorter match times

I'm sure there are things I'm not considering or am ignorant of because I don't have much time-played on specific heroes. All I can say is that I enjoyed the faster pacing, and made Overwatch feel more like an actual *team-based game* again by rewarded players for actually working together to achieve something. 

---

##**TL;DR** -- It cuts out a *lot* of the downtime you spend waiting for respawns and grouping, and makes it feel like an actual team game again by rewarding you for *playing the freaking objectives together** leading to a more immersive game, and more action-per-minute

I made it to Gold 3 somehow.,"I previously posted about being thrown into Gold lobbies immediately after finishing the 50 wins in QP.

I started out in comp playing support, got rolled and won 1 out of 3 matches. Then I tried DPS, lost again. Afterwards I decided to do open queue and played Tank without high hopes, I won and decided to Role Queue on Tank and main Ramattra. It turns out I wasn't just in Gold but actually Gold 4 specifically and after going 5-4 I ranked up to Gold 3.

Why are people already saying Muagas Kit needs a rework?," I watch YouTube videos occasionally about Overwatch and a reoccurring theme in all of them is that Muagas kit doesn’t lend itself to being balanced.

  Most YouTubers spout the same opinion of “He’s impossible to balance his kit doesn’t lend itself to ever being balanced, he’ll always be either OP or underpowered” at the end of that they usually compare him to roadhog. 

 I wouldn’t be writing this post if it was just Muaga, but it seems like with every new hero (aside from JQ) released since OW2 this same rhetoric has been repeated. It’s bland af I support discourse, but come on this same talking point has already been beat to death. We’ve seen it with sojourn “her railgun can never be balanced she’s essentially widow with no downside that comes with actually playing widow”, “Ramattras kit is loaded, he can punch through shields and has a crazy ult. Great job blizzard this hero is game breakin and OP”, “LWs kit is clunky and needs to be reworked”.

 I’m convinced that if Reinhardt was added today this same sentiment would be spewed. It’d probably go something like “NEW HERO REINHARDT CANT BE BALANCED EITHER HIS HAMMER DOES TOO MUCH DAMAGE OR NOT ENOUGH, blizzard needs to go back to the drawing board with this one”.

 OW players give zero time to allow things to play out and automatically chalk a characters core design up as a failure because they’ve played 10 games with it. 

 If any of you have played streetfighter, I think OW can learn something from the balance of their game they haven’t released a single balance change in the 7 months of the game being released during that time metas have shifted, characters have risen and fallen on the tier list previous S tiers have fallen to D and vice versa. All because Capcom let things play out.

 In conclusion I just wish OW players would demonstrate a modicum of patience with new characters and take the time to learn how and where the strengths can be applied.",Overwatch,1705682254.0,t3_19an9lu
Victorian era Tracer,"Greetings OW community

You might have seen my previous victorian arts through this week, if not, you can find them in Ashe and Widow subreddits.

For this art, I wanted to pushed myself forward, wanted to challenge myself, I am in the process of keep improving my drawing skills, so some stuff on this art might look off. Hope you understand.

Here is the description of this victorian era steampunk theme: 

In the winding streets of a Victorian steampunk cityscape, Tracer emerges as a beacon of temporal elegance. Her attire, a fusion of Victorian fashion and steampunk ingenuity, is adorned with intricate gears, corset lacing, and asymmetrical layers of flowing fabric.

A high-collared, leather-trimmed jacket and fingerless gloves complete her stylish ensemble.Tracer's iconic chronal accelerator receives a captivating steam-powered overhaul, with brass pipes weaving around it like a delicate lattice. 

The device emits a soft hiss as steam escapes, adding an air of mystery to the temporal technology that powers her swift maneuvers. 

Goggles rest atop Tracer's forehead, ready to be pulled down when the need for speed arises.

Her pulse pistols, adorned with Victorian embellishments, echo the era's craftsmanship, featuring ornate scrollwork and a polished bronze finish.

"Intentional feeding, extremely obvious","I am mostly confused if anything, this guy attached with the picture attached joined the game as wooden was shooting the ground and just jumped off a cliff, we were still winning 4v5 so it did not matter as much.

He then left the game with 0 dms and came back right after and proceeded to have 0 dmv just getting himself eliminated going to the front lines.

What can I do? This was by far one of my worst experiences and this last few weeks of matchmaking have been awful, just got out of another game which was 4vs5 which we were winning before someone left.

"Awkward (the streamer) is absolutely cringe, regardless of whether or not he makes some good points.","Does anyone else cringe watching this dude? What's up with his strange hyperfixation on doing damage? I agree that dealing damage as a support is very important, however, he made a video where he solely healbotted, and he also made a video where he only did damage as support, not healing any of his teammates. (Therefore throwing both games btw, because he was not playing the game to his full potential solely for content.) If he won the game during the video where he was only healbotting, he would talk about how he was hard cringing because he was not doing any damage, yet in the video where he was only dealing damage, he got mad at his teammates for getting mad at him because he was not healing them, which is totally justifiable from his teammates. He literally threw a game for content, yet because he was doing damage, he said something along the lines of ""we still won the game, so why are you complaining? "" bro... how are you genuinely be that much of a weirdo. Don't even get me started on his twitter. HOLY FUCK.

And what inspired me to make this post is a short he made on his youtube channel about players who counter-picked. If you're playing pharah against double hitscan, it's going to be much harder for you to consistently do your job because you always have to play in great positions, and how are you not throwing by not switching to another hero? Sure, if you're really good you'll probaby still carry, however, most people are not able to land consistent headshots the way he does. Therefore, how are they a ""silver or gold player"" by counter-picking. It's so annoying, because most of his advice is great, but he also manages to say some of the dumbest things imaginable.

Overall, he gives good advice, but some things you should just not listen to. As much as he says he doesn't blame his teammates he still does. For instance, in one video, he kept whining about his Ana staying on cart, and he followed up by saying ""I cannot blame him though, because if I was playing better I would still win."" By saying the former, you are already blaming your teammate. No shit, if you play perfectly you could probably win that game. The fact that someone as good as him couldn't carry that game means that either someone on your team was throwing, or the other team was playing better. However, you're still blaming a teammate by pointing out a mistake someone on your team was making, which is fine, but you cannot say that and simultaneously tell your audience that you're not blaming your team by saying how if you played better, you'd win. 

His gameplay also does not align with his advice. In the video where he did an unranked to GM on baptiste, he was healing his team, yet he said that that hero basically relies solely on damage. Why is it so hard to acknowledge that as support, you're supposed to do healing and damage simultaneously in order to be super high rank. The way he preaches damage while neglecting healing is very weird to me.

Question about getting to Grandmaster/Top 500.,"So my question is simple, is getting Grandmaster/Top 500 just about luck?

I'm a solo Genji main on Console, I worked my way to (currently) Master 4 and (Not to toot my own horn) but I play fairly well basically every match I play. I'm usually always dropping double digit kills while rarely ever touching double digits deaths (My K/D is like 4.3 or something). Even in matches where my team gets rolled, I'm usually still doing fairly well in said matches.

With all of that being said, I'm currently under the impression that it genuinely takes luck (consistently getting good teams, with good coms, good game sense, good aim and etc.) to move up from where I currently am (Master 4). (Again not to sound cocky) But if I were to consistently get teammates that play as well as I do, I'm pretty sure I'd be GM by now. The reason I've been stuck at Master 4 for about a week now is quite literally because my teammates just aren't holding their own weight. Whether it be the Tank of my team, the other DPS, or one or both of my supports.

Honestly I'm fine with staying Master 4, I rarely get mad and I just like to enjoy playing the game! But like I said before, I honestly do think I would be GM by now if I consistently got better teammates with better chemistry. But I wanna hear what you guys have to say/think!

Do you guys agree that it takes luck (to some degree) to move up in rank? I've hit GM in the past so I'm really not concerned with reaching it again, I just want to know everyone's thoughts on the luck question! Looking forward to your responses!",Overwatch,1705669247.0,t3_19aik0g

What an actual ban appeal response sent by a human at Blizzard looks like,"Context: A few months back I was having an especially rough time and it reflected in my attitude in the game. For reference I play at GM level and was losing a LOT for whatever reason. As a result, I got myself banned for a month for being toxic in chat - deserved and I've taken steps to better myself. Not that this is intended to defend myself in any way, but just for clarity my brand of toxicity is ""you're braindead"" and not racism or anything like that. Happy to report I've had no further penalty since then.

For reference, I have thousands of Overwatch hours recorded on this account since 2017 and in that time, until last year, I'd had 1 single comms ban years ago. No suspensions. I also have dozens of reports against other players actioned.

I thought it would be useful/illuminating/funny to share the ban appeal that I received, which was written by an actual human and not just automated like the ridiculous ones I've seen lately (and suspect a lot of them are fake or otherwise leaving out key info).

My appeal reasoning was that it was typical in game banter, which in some ways it was but in a lot of ways it wasn't. That's where the ""I don't think I've crossed a line..."" quote comes from - not something I've seen in any of the recent viral ban responses.

I play support nowadays so I often don’t have to wait longer than a minute before I’m in another match. For DPS and Tank though, it’s a different story, especially in competitive.

"If Mercy were removed, what will be the benefits and drawbacks?","Come from a guy who has most hours on Mercy.

I think the major benefits is that balancing the Damage characters will become much easier since Mercy's pocket healing / damage boosting turns every DPS into monster picks. There are DPS (especially Pharah) being held back from buffs because of Mercy, meanwhile those DPS perform mediocre when not combo with Mercy but too strong when pocketed.

Another benefit is that the gameplay becomes much less frustrating. It's understandable when your hard-earned kill being undone; you have to land consecutive shots to kill one guy while Mercy nullifies your damage by simply holding a button. Also, killing Mercy is easier said than done because how mobile she is. Unlike Team Fortress 2, players receive less healing when taking damage which makes Medic's pocket-healing less frustrating to play against. Medic himself is also very fragile despite he's the second-fastest character.

For the major drawback, the playerbase will decrease since Mercy players take some portion of it (Playerbase decreased -> less money earned for Blizzard). Look around at hero main subreddits, Mercy main subreddit possibly have the most number of members/subscribers (above 30k), meanwhile Ana main & Rein main also have a lot (above 20k). The purpose of Mercy is to attract players who play Medic from Team Fortress 2, just like they make Soldier:76 to attract players from COD; Pharah to attract Quake players or TF2 Soldier mains; etc. 

Another drawback is that Mercy's VA (Lucie Pohl) might lose her job opportunity as there will be no more in-game voice lines for her. Unless they keep her for voicing Mercy in PVE cutscenes or animated shorts in the future.",Overwatch,1705647264.0,t3_19ad1ek

Mercy rez replacement,"the rez discourse is too much. people are complaining and won't stop, so maybe it's time to just give her a different ability. i mean it's not even that fun to use anyway.

my idea was to give her an ability that functions in a similar way but has more counter play. 


u can place a mark on an ally that stays for 2 seconds (time is debatable) and if they die within that time they spawn back in after a second with a maximum of 300hp (meaning that squishies will be at full health while tanks are capped at 300hp). 24 second cd


this gives players a counter to rez (not shooting the enemy once they see the mark) and also raises mercy's skill ceiling (having the timing down so enemies don't have time to react). On top of that this removes the LOS discussion for rez and doesn't make rezzing a tank as frustrating. 


I think mercy's ability should stay single target, as to not mess with her pocket identity as much. Another idea i like is overhealth u can place on an ally (think of it like sym 1.0 shields)

Not to mention how if people don't read every post on the sub before making their own, they get comments like “I've seen this complaint 20 times today.” Ideally, we would only need one post per hero that perfectly sums up everything good or bad about their current state, but this will never be the case. People don't know everything, so of course there are going to be different posts by different people with overlapping ideas. This post is not trying to justify any of the complaints that are often made, but to point out that just because the whole sub doesn't line up on a single hero for an extended period of time doesn't mean that people are complaining just to complain.",Overwatch,1705634845.0,t3_19a9d7l

Why is it so difficult to rank up?,"Two seasons ago, I managed to achieve diamond in sup

Today, I can't get out of silver 1

It seems that the more matches you lose, the less chance you have of ranking up, even if you have the best stats during the game and played really well.

And in several of these matches there is a big difference between players on my team compared to the opposing team, basically either you humiliate or you are humiliated.

There are also several trolls, who end the sup match with 1k healing, or DPSs who are 1/11 (seriously, this actually happened in one of my matches.)

It seems that even if you play impeccably, there will always be someone on your team to ruin the game. And with that, climbing the ranks playing solo becomes an almost impossible task in lower ranks.

Blizzard needs to fix this.

A player on the enemy team messaged in all chat ""All bot team?"" after only like 30 seconds in the match and at first I thought he was just joking as we got rolled first fight.

Change 1: His ultimate now also lets him fly upward, empowering his ultimate based on distance fallen. Second activation propels him downward.

Change 2: The farther he falls, the stronger his ultimate becomes. It becomes a wider cone the farther he falls, until it becomes 360 degrees. It also 1 shots anyone at the center at that point.

How do you not emotional when climbing,"Just like a lot of you, I play comp to climb but the problem for me is that I can get very emotional. I get upset if they a turret because I know my teammates aren’t going to do anything about it. They have a mercy, they can’t aim worth shit (and neither can I to be honest). I sometimes strain my throat yelling obscenities and the like (not into coms). I once gotten so angry that tears started to form. I also greatly tie my self worth to my rank, so if it goes down I feel like an embarrassment and should be ashamed of even trying to reach masters (I’m gold 4).

Play with friends: The only friend I play with is in masters and I prefer to solo queue because I feel like I’m being boosted if I play in a group. I also still get upset if I play with a friend.

Play to improve, not to win: When I do try to improve, I always slip back into trying to win, the moment it looks like we’re going to lose.

Play to have fun: I only have fun if I win

So how do y’all not get so emotional when climbing?",Overwatch,1705601595.0,t3_199wll8

A hero that was significantly influenced by poverty?(Diversity question),"Overwatch is praised for its Diverse set of characters and their backstories. We have different ethnicities, queers, races and etc.

But so far we havent seen anyone who was affected significantly by poverty or, in other words, being poor. The closest we got to it probably was Baptiste. But it is not shown nor in his dialogues, nor in his backstory.

It doesnt need to be a money/power hungry villain, it can be a nice guy that promotes modesty.

Is anyone still having fun in this game anymore?,"I feel like the majority of my friends have moved on from OW, but I still find it addicting sometimes. It’s really hard for me to get into an online shooter, so when I do, I hold on longer than most. The dynamic of matches has became increasingly dull though.

At first I appreciated the inclusion of the stat board, since people being toxic with no actual clue what was going on was such a common occurrence in OW 1, but now it’s turned everyone into stat watchers. More focused on a number, then what’s going on in the game.

Most recent match I had a rein push into spawn which kept getting him killed, he proceeded to blame me because he had 5 more kills than me. Kills that get you killed in the process, aren’t actual kills, but this dude didn’t understand that.

It’s crazy that I still see cringy toxic stuff from OW1, along with the stat board obsessing players who have “adapted” to OW2. I can’t go a match without someone calling out a 1 k difference, whether its healing or damage, as soon as someone in the losing team has a slight difference, it’s like all hands on deck.

Y’all need to understand that these matches are long, and the wind can always change, but you’re less likely to gain an advantage if your method of “support” is to abuse your teammates.

The other day I had a tank with half the damage of the opposing one, and all I said was “I believe in us.” They replied “yas queen.” Even though they didn’t match in damage, they ended with like 50 n 6 kills. Most of anyone in the match by far, and we decimated the other team. I’m just saying, I get that we all want to win, and when you have someone who is clearly not getting they need to switch, that’s different. But some of y’all are so ready to blame someone else, it’s like every match somebody needs to blamed. It’s like y’all think if you get in a “tank diff, healers trash, dps threw” then the winning team is gonna think “oh ok, this one guy was good, let’s leave here and respect this one guy.” They literally do not care. Just take the L and move on.
 
Again, I’m not saying we should all just be nice all the time and ignore stupidity, just ask yourself if it’s worth it. Is losing so scary to you that you absolutely cannot have any fun, because if that’s the case, I honestly don’t know why you get on.

Edit: just won a match, high kill count, POTG with Hanzo. Called out by our own tank at the end because of a 1K damage difference. That actually really frustrated me. Our team finished 3 n 1, wasn’t even close. Just, why? *sigh* I think the best advice I’ve gotten is to turn off chat, which is kind of sad cause I’ve had a lot of good feedback from there, and I also like to be able to communicate with my teammates. It’s not even enough to win and rack up headshots, you just need to be aiming for the tank and focus on your damage numbers in order for your team to feel like you contributed…",Overwatch,1705588810.0,t3_199rmiz

Other than that, why do I need to wait so long to just not get a penalty? 4v5 it's pretty much guaranteed loss all the time, I should be able to propose a concede to my teammates and if everybody agrees the game just ends and you move on.

A new concept for the Damage passive.,"Basically, if an enemy hero only has a sliver of ther maximum health left, you deal more damage.

Let's say they have 20% of their max health or less. Damage heroes would deal an additional 50% damage to them.

Like a League execute. Something that helps with securing kills and getting eliminations.

Obviously, you'd need to look into average damage dps to make sure it doesn't make the time to kill go into the ground, and characters like Genji and Tracer would probably get more out of this than most, but I think it could benefit more or less any damage hero.

Not to mention with every hero getting some kind of out-of-combat health regen, it would greatly help there too.

Kiriko could have a 40% win rate and still be frustrating to play against.,"I'm a GM DPS and Support. I've done it with Tracer, Ana, Moira, and Kiriko. so i'm not talking out of my ass knowing the differences between these roles and heroes. I saw a recent thread in the kiriko main subreddit where they legit did not understand the hate she gets all the time claiming she's a high skill character, has the same escapes as sojourn, tracer, reaper, sym, etc... and that she's not that strong citing win rates lots of times which as we know, win rates don't tell the full picture so those are pointless to bring up. Let me explain to people why it's not her balance but it's her kit that is designed to be as frustrating as possible.

so to put it simply...

# Even when you take a fight against Kiriko and win, you lose.

What hero in the game outside of kiriko can missplay every cooldown and still use their mobility to immediately get way to safety and provide team value while ignoring their own positioning?

lets say I take a duel with kiriko and I'm winning and I force both her CD's. I cannot chase her down and punish her. most likely i probably had to use CD's as well and she can TP back into the fight with 0 downtime as she can immediately heal and help her team while i need to walk back before i can do the same. That downtime in a fight is huge. She can keep healing and doing damage but i cannot reengage or catch up to her or my team in the same speed. I need someone else to capitalize on her in the next 7 seconds for her to die and her TP literally took her next to her teammate so she has guaranteed help already. the only way you win is by one shotting her or blocking her suzu and the current S tier DPS to play are Sojourn and Mei because of that reason.

I saw them post about her low accuracy of her kunai as justification that she's not that strong but if even GM players have 16% kunai hit accuracy and it really wasn't that strong why bother at all? Her damage doesn't need to be consistent to have a lot of value. you get it by spamming which makes it even more frustrating on the other end and her low consistency in hitting shots while still providing value is proof of that. and the kunai fly in a straight line so it's not hard to aim at head level spamming. a single headshot on anyone can be a quick pick or easy for someone else to follow up on. she's dangerous up close but also far away. Zen used to be the glass cannnon dps but you could dive Zen players that didn't have good positioning. Kiriko can be scary up close and far away and can't be dove easily. There is no range in which she is all that weak.

Kiriko's TP is also not like moira's fade, you can chase a moira that fucks up her fade and can see where she goes. you can chase a reaper as he telegraphs his TP and stands still for it. Sym needs to build her teleporter and has to be in LOS. Tracer you can literally only blink a short distance and needs to be mindful of how many she has and her cover around her. every hero with mobility still needs to be smart about their positioning. kiriko doesn't need to be. she doesn't have to play around cover and her TP is through walls and instant and it doesn't even need to be aimed. so even if you force her to use it you cannot follow as any hero. the moment she TP's out she also starts regaining health. Even then when other heroes save their mobility to take a risk in the enemy backline it is exactly that a risk they take but not for her.

now lets talk about Suzu. another immortality ability that can deny even hard to hit ultimates by throwing something at the ground. you don't even need to arc it like a nade as it throws in a pretty straight line. it's really not hard to hit a suzu and you can do it every 15 seconds. landing a hard to hit ultimate only to have it absorbed because a support threw something at the ground is frustrating. the skill expression needed to land what used to be game changing ultimates are getting countered by abilities that don't need to be aimed even. at least if i was nano'd as dps and i got slept it felt like the ana earned that. or if i hit a sticky or a grav but it was countered by beat it felt like a worthy trade. now it just feels like every support has an easy mode deny ability to shut down dps and tanks. or sometimes more than one. If i as a tracer am fighting a 2v1 and i blink 180 stick someone, that ultimate shouldn't be countered by a support throwing an ability at the ground. it doesn't feel like Kiriko earned that save vs what i had to do to try and get it.

now to anyone about to say ""you just need to bait out cooldowns first"". if that's what you believe then you are admitting that support dictates which teams win or lose. whichever team misuses their immortality abilities or forces their supports to misuse them is the one that loses and not the team who popped off or who made big plays. sitting there holding ultimates until you see supports make their move isn't fun for everyone else. there is no back and forth right now like there used to be. you used to counter ultimates with other ults and now you just counter them with regular abilities. supports holding these abilities make it so other players can't play. you can't junkerqueen ult knowing suzu is up. you can't sticky as tracer knowing suzu is up. You can't mei blizzard knowing it's up. you can't even grav if you know suzu is up. you can't even chase a kiriko down to kill her so you don't have to worry about it. her entire kit is meant to be frustrating to anyone other than her. you have to sit and wait for kiriko to fuck up to make your play and that is why it's not fun for literally anyone else. has nothing to do with winrate or whether the average player can get value out of her. Her kit dictates you taking action.

in a fair matchup of equally skilled players it is impossible to duel her and feel like you won anything out of that interaction but it is also impossible to ignore her and make a play on someone else. Her whole kit is meant to be frustrating to anyone other than her.

EDIT: To people telling me how to kill kiriko i'm well aware of what people need to do in order to counter her in her current state. Telling me that it requires teamwork to kill her well of course, that's true for any hero but it requires a lot more for her and you cannot 1v1 a kiriko and ever win. that's the whole point. besides even if i call out in comms that kiriko's tp is down what are the odds my whole team is even in voice? what if some are chat banned? every 1v1 duel with heroes in overwatch have a back and forth and each is trying to get the other to misuse their abilities to have an advantage to capitalize and outplay. kiriko doesn't have that. if she fucks up she can suzu and if she fucks up more she leaves in an instant. it's not a healthy design.

EDIT2: saying there are other supports with frustrating immortality abilities isn't a justification for her existing. saying there could be worse things in your opinion is not the strong argument you think it is. it is not a good reason to not try and improve what we have. we have a live game that is literally about constant iteration and changes that will happen so we should constantly want to improve what we have. comparing it to something like sleep dart is also not a fair comparison when i have a lot more confidence in landing a suzu than i do a sleep dart when a genji blades. the skill required for both is vastly different and they both have almost the same cool down. how easy an ability is to perform vs how much value it gets and when it needs to be used all play into how strong something is. most countering abilities are predicts and immortality abilities are reacts and it's much easier to react and perform these immortality abilities than it is to predict whats going to happen. this adds to how frustrating they are to deal with.

EDIT Final: For those still thinking I just want her nerfed into the ground that isn't it. number won't help her. if you think i don't have any ideas of how to do that you'd be wrong. if you want to know where i would hypothetically take her kit here's just me brainstorming what i'd like to see from her. 

* Damage - kunai now have a damage fall off. kiriko is scary up close and should be the brawler/anti dive support but she shouldn't be sniping and getting random picks like hanzo arrows because that's frustrating. this also helps teach players the best way to play her as it's easier to hit projectiles the closer you get so it's designed in a way that actually teaches players the best way to play her naturally. it also gives her a counter of long to mid range poke.
* Healing - her papers are no longer auto aim and actually need to be thrown onto someone where they will stick. they move similar in speed to ana no scoping shots. when you attach a paper to someone it will slowly release a heal over time but never over health. you can attach multiple to one target as well to stack but if you attach too many to one person you won't have them for your other teammates as they need to charge. you can hit them pre emptively to help incoming damage as well. if you miss the paper will attach itself to the closest geometry there and if an ally walks past the paper it will be picked up by them. this will allow kiriko to have more skill expression in her heals as well as help heal people that are constantly out of line of sight. she has a limited number of papers though so she has to pick between helping people flanking, stack them onto one person, or help on the frontline and can't just spam to everyone.
* Swift step - range is shortened but goes a set distance and can pass through one wall but doesn't need a teammate to teleport to. she can use it to just close a distance or get into a nearby room. she can use it to dodge abilities or in a duel for a better position. this means she can now use her mobility offensively or defensively but also needs to be mindful of her environment. it also means the person dueling her can feel like there's a chance to outplay her and her to outplay them.
* Suzu - still cleanses and heals but needs to actually hit an ally to cause the explosion cleanse. no longer makes players intangible or immortal though. however, it can also be throw at enemies to cause them to slow down but still would need to hit them. they still can use their abilities but helps give suzu a means to be used offensively, defensively, and also offensively like on a nano blade to help your team defensively. probably could have it's CD shortened this way as well because it would be harder to hit.
* Kitsune - i have fewest issues with i'm ok with leaving it alone.",Overwatch,1705569619.0,t3_199m559

Now I'm losing and not really getting that angry like it would ruin my day before quicker play started.

Why I dislike Season 8,"I have never been so frustrated with this game ever before, but this season has started the stress i have been receiving as of late.

First it was the start of the Mauga meta. Every game you either had to play auga or you would lose the game. Or if you beat the tank in a team fight, it would be an instant swap to mauga causing you to, Again, Swap to mauga.

Then the mid season patch comes, they buff sombra, sojourn, orisa, and lifeweaver.

 ""so now you can't have fun. Hahah!"" -blizzard executives

Tank and Dps still feel awful to play when everything you do gets out damaged or outhealed by supports. It is constantly tiring and annoying to play characters like Reaper or Roadhog, only to be instantly killed or denied any value by characters like Ana, Bap, and Kiriko. (I would say zen but he has went through enough + im a zen main)

Along with this I've been finding a whole lot more throwers in my games than ever. And I'm not tryna talk mean, but you got no idea how many bad players I have had recently, and I heard other players have had them as well.

Honestly I just hate this season cuz of the whole buffs and nerfs. Yall buff orisa n sombra, but you nerf hog? Ik the hog nerf wasn't big but it's just the thought of them Buffing Orisa but Nerfing Roadhog that sickens me.",Overwatch,1705547807.0,t3_199g4pk
Why can't Genji be any good?,"**GM 5 Take. I'm almost a Genji One Trick, 800+ Hours.**  
I just don't understand why. Genji has been Awful/Bad/Mid since his nerfs at S1. Everyone and even Blizzard says to us ""We want Genji in that spot, he is fine."" Don't get me wrong, Genji is not BAD. But he is NOT FINE either, it is a complicated case, i'd say.  
What makes Genji Mains(me included) feel bad/weak about him, is his Effort-To-Value ratio. I mean, i summed up, i can have like 650 dedicated into this Hero and still be in Diamond/Plat, while someone can have 1/3 effort/mechanical skill i do, get 3x the value i get and get GM maining other Heroes.  


Now with that explained, lemme ask something to you rq. Do you think when Genji was S Tier, before his nerfs, he was too annoying? There was a lot of people complaining that ""Genji was good""? Do you think Dive Meta is unfun to play with/against?  
Cause i don't, and i think most of the players also do not. I've heard from A LOT of Players, Streamers, Pro Players, Friends that the most FUN META is the DIVE META.   
So why people think Genji needs to be nerfed into the ground? He is a dive character. He has a high skill floor and high skill ceiling, so it's not like ""Uh, braindead character good, not fun"" No, Genji has to know what hes doing to confirm kills and make space, it is just a HARD Character being FUN and GOOD. That's all.  


We have a lot of characters that has been META SINCE THEIR RELEASE, we have characters that HAS NOT BEEN ANYTHING BUT INSANE SINCE THEIR RELEASE!  
Kiriko has not been bad a single Season in this game. Sojourn was hard meta and somehow GOT BUFFED. Ana, Bap, Illari, good since their release. Orisa gota a unnecessary buff rn, etc...   
Genji has easy counters and it's so easy to deal with him. All his counters got buffed since he got his HUGE NERF, poor boy? Symmetra, Zarya, Torb, Mei, Moira, Brig, they all got buffed since S1!

- Split up the Change of Pace challenge into 4 separate ones: 15 games of Mystery Heroes, 15 games of Deathmatch, 15 games of Arcade, and collect 4000 emblems in Hero Mastery.
- Change Role Mastery to count for any normal 5v5 mode including Mystery Heroes and some Arcade modes.

Overwatch character concept (healer) Sanguis,"(this was og back in overwatch 1 idea i made, but my audience wants me to post it on reddit) XD so if some abilitys seem off or like they already exist in overwatch now, that is why XD  
 

I loved Blame the controllers character concepts and wanted to make one of my own. I will follow the same idea (with a little less art or alot)

Hero Creation Method: 

Create an interesting ability and build around that. 

Goal for Sanguis

1: Create a 300 hp healer

2: Healing must be based off of damage 

3: be able to peel for her supporters or other allies. 

Sanguis, Talons combat ready healer, Ready to stand and fight or peel for allies. Why fight back when they hurt themself fighting us? Sanguis (concept) originally followed under mercy. Seeing her ways and taking notes. She knew mercy had a dark past and she refused to let anyone, even her friends know about it, even enough to push some away causing Sanguis to find her own answers. 

( selfish and selfless ) Left click and right-click selfish and selfless, selfish restores Health to the user using it, deals 40 damage a second while healing 20 and  selfless restore 40 HP per second stealing half from your own hp, up to half of your HP. you have 300 HP. Red effects come in and out when sucking life from your foes and healing from your allies.

Teather (e): Grabs the target and stops them from moving at full speed (50% movement speed reduction. During this time you cannot use your primary abilities (selfish-selfless). This ability lasts 2 seconds with a 8 second cd (has a 15 yard range activation distance)

(Charmic trap) shift: She puts down a trap that connects with the first foe to walk into it. If thrown again it replaces the first one. It causes no damage but when the attacker deals damage they take 20% of the damage dealt. It lasts for 4 seconds when triggered. It leaves dark red splotches on the person's screen indicating it's on them as it washes off. It has a 6 second cd and recharges after it is thrown out. It has a larger hitbox then junkrat's trap equaling a 2 meter size. 

Ultimately voiceline ""we all die as one "" 

The Ultimate has 2 effects: 

1 : creates a Winston bubble size sphere which shares HP between all Allied players within it to the percent of the lowest player. example;  Anna is at 50 HP and Baptiste is at 150 HP, each of their HP pools go to 100 every ½ second. 

2 : This heals 200 per second divided up per person in the ultimate. (if 2 people are in it, it heals 100 per second, if 4 it heals 50 per second. This ultimate lasts 5 seconds 

(It is blood red and not blue like Winston's bubble. It emanates around Sanguis and when someone is injured you see red particles fly between all the allies in the zone fixing the injured allies.

Passive: when your abilities are in effect you heal 10 per second (ability not primary or secondary)   


please feel free to tell me how to change it if its horrible XD ",Overwatch,1705544911.0,t3_199f50g
What are the best Overwatch Skins? #5 Brigitte,"I'd argue that Brigitte probably has one of the best skin catalogs of any hero. And I'd argue that it is because she is just very easy to make good skins for. She is a woman plated in armor with a mace and shield, which is already a pretty generic template to design skins for. And to Blizzard's credit, they do find a lot of good ways to reskin Brig and add to what she already is. 

Azure Drake does a fantastic job putting Brig in a more ""Fantasy"" aesthetic, and I'd argue is one of her best fantasy skins. Riot Police, despite my distaste for it, does do a good job dressing her up as a part of the police force as I think it fits her pretty well. Mechanic also does a good job expressing how good she is with machines. Her father is Torbjorn, and so I find it very cool that her intelligence and tech-savvy part of herself is expressed in this skin. And Antifragile BB works pretty well as a way to cast Brig as part of a K-pop band.

And while all of these skins are very good and really well executed, nothing compares to ""Sol"" Brigitte. And the reason why is simply because the skin fits really well with her aesthetic. Brigitte to me reads as a stoic warrior ready to aid her allies, and what better way to express that than to put her in some shiny paladin armor? The skin itself is also very well-detailed and does a good job reskinning her weapons to fit the fantasy aesthetic.

Enable mouse and keyboard support for console and add input based matchmaking,"This does not mean anyone on PC would be using aim assist or anything. This also obviously won’t solve the xim problem, as those players would still want to play in the controller pool to keep their cheating advantage.

But still, why not? Both the PS5 and Xbox series x/s support mouse and keyboard input natively. Many games, including some activision games, allow it. Controller players on PC would have an advantage over console players because they can have 300 FPS, sure. I don’t think that’s a good argument against allowing them to play in the console pool, but you can even just make it 1 way for fairness if you want (meaning console players with mnk can play on PC, but no PC players can play in console pool, regardless of input).

I don’t see any reason why you wouldn’t at least enable mouse and keyboard support for console and let them play in PC lobbies. Keep in mind that this isn’t some impossible new and expensive thing for blizzard to do. This is already a thing for MW3 and warzone. Any argument about these players being bad also means you shouldn’t let people on PC with <=120fps play the game either. They’ll get to the MMR they belong at, just like everyone else on lower end hardware.",Overwatch,1705536222.0,t3_199c0d6
Silly Players,"For a group that loves to complain about supports, you folks sure don't try to shoot at them ever, even to pressure them into another position. If I play DPS, I pretty much don't get to play the game. If I am playing support, I not only don't die but pretty rarely get shot AT. 

Now I know I know, ""LeT mE wAlK bY tHe TaNk AnD 2 DpS tO dO tHaT"". I'm not saying you can do that, but I am saying that when I die as support, it is usually because at least one person realizes their guns have bullets that shoot further than their arms can reach and aim for me in the back line. 

Just some food for thought.",Overwatch,1705535938.0,t3_199bw6w

Is there somewhere where you can see if people are disconnecting a lot? I'm not talking about something like [downdetector.com](https://downdetector.com) as the servers are technically not down, it is just one of those days where there are so many disconnects you can't have a normal game.

On brighter side of things we like about OW2...,"On brighter side of all things OW2, I really like that hero progression tracks different stats/things for every hero, so in a long run you can actually kinda infer somebody's or your own playstyle, based on what level you are on each stat.

I'll bring screenshot of my Reinhardt for example, because 1, he is my main ""main"" and 2, I really like the story that this screenshot, and these numbers progression always, tell you about how I play. I'm a data/numbers guy, and I love this shit!

https://preview.redd.it/a6l54cib72dc1.jpg?width=3440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2bf42ef98b8056b8b596d4e9d48e3d0affbc488

I'm an ""aggressive"" but ""good""(ish?) Rein and it comes with its goods and bads!

So the highest stat is, def obviously if you played w me, Charge Pins; it's my strongest suit. I do predictive charges often and often successful! It's my special Rein sense or something and it's totally MY Rein's main thing to notice. Then comes Damage Mitigated and Time Played, kinda going hand in hand; which makes sense, its basically your shield uptime and your beefiness which is your function as a tank and thus comparable with time played. Then it goes to Damage Dealt and Shatter Stuns; this I guess means my damage falls a little behind. but shatter stuns being in my top 5 stats also makes sense; since I usually get big shatters (but sometimes not so well-timed, which is why my shatter kills is my lowest stat, but before getting there..) . Next up is Fire Strike Hits and Wins. Fire Strike Hits makes sense; I pretty much use it on cooldown and sometimes not throw the best ones. Wins being 98 compared to my Time Played being 114, is kinda your win percentage; its not great for me here, but its decent. Then in the end is Weapon Kills and Shatter Kills. I was surprised to find Weapon Kills here; this means I dont use my hammer too much. This screenshot was a few weeks ago and this for example was a good note for me to increase my hammer swinging! And last is Shatter Kills, which I guess makes sense since sometimes I get over excited and hit a 5 man shatter, only then to realize my whole or most team is dead... I know; its a problem.. but therefore, high Shatter Stuns count but low Shatter Kills count.

And Voila! You can literally find my strengths and weakness by looking at that screenshot or opening Progression at any moment. You can use this to find your weak points and focus on those; or to exploit your strong points. 

Anyways, its a cool little thing. I like it!",Overwatch,1705526223.0,t3_19980rr

It’s impossible to believe Overwatch is set 60 years after 2016.,"
I was just getting out of a match in Overwatch 2 and I’ve started to think about it. I’ve been playing the first game since the year it came out back in 2016, and I do know for a fact the devs at one point said that the events of the game takes place approximately 60-70 years into the future. How, exactly?

Flying cars, flying airships, floating areas and the fact that they use this weird, levitational technology on objects with wheels but it seems that the wheels are just designed for show. It’s just hard to believe that the lore takes place 60 years after 2016. I mean, 60 years? Seriously? It seems at least 200 years with all these designs and vehicles etc. I don’t think after 60 years our world would gorgeously look like that.

I’ve always been fascinated by the lore of Overwatch, I think it has such an amazing and interesting universe.

And one of the things that fascinates me the most is the fact that the Arabic language exists in this world, I am Arab myself and seeing an Egyptian character like Ana is so so amazing! Her lines and speaking dialogues are 100000% spot on and it is EXACTLY how modern Egyptians sound today. Not just her voice, even her words in Arabic are just so precise and native. I find it amazing how blizzard truly outdid themselves in terms of getting an Arab person to voice her perfectly. Aysha Selim did such a tremendous job!

Not only do I like the fact that Arabic exists, but it’s so cool to see a woman having a history of being a soldier turned general in the Egyptian military. Today in Egypt, only men are enlisted to be combat or war soldiers in the Egyptian army, armed forces only accept women as civil workers or specialized officers outside of combat missions. A woman in Egypt now can get enlisted as a registered nurse for example, or a medical officer, but not as a combat soldier.

This is why I find it impossible that it’s set only 60 years into the future. I think it’s WAY into the future. I don’t see women being finally permitted to enter the military in Egypt in 60 years from now a plausible or even a convincing possibility. I might be wrong, but as an arab who knows Arabic societies very well, I just don’t think it’s believable.",Overwatch,1705517809.0,t3_1994h7q

I think reflect should be resource based without a cooldown between uses but a bit of time to recharge and if you run out it's a long cooldown

That'd make genji easier to dive in without worry because your sustain isn't a one time use, this would also make it harder to bait but easier to overwhelm.

mauga rework idea,"ok so i see that mauga is too annoying to fight so i have come up with a rework idea for him

 so first i thikn they should remove both of his guns and replace them with pharah rockets. he can shoot 5 rockets a second with both guns but if you shoot both the spread increases and he shoots 10 rockets a second. this removes his fire and crit dmg while making him still good. he has 100 ammo 

then i think they should  remove his cardiac overdrive and instead give him a nano boost type ability. so he heals 400hp and gets 40% dmg reduction and 40% dmg boost for 5s and the cooldown is 10s

then i think they should remove his running ability. i think they should replace it with a genji dash. he will go 20m in 0.1s and it will do a 100 dmg aoe. with 8s cd but it resets everytime he gets a kill

then his ult is annoying so i just make it so that instead of locking everyone in a cage mauga will activate his ult and then he will do a pharah barrage that goes through walls. so you cant use cover against his ult

i think they should also remove all of his hp but give him 500 shields and every second he generates 30 overhp even while taking dmg capping at 500 overhp",Overwatch,1705516023.0,t3_1993qdd

Because of Junkrat's HARD HARD counters, you're basically just trolling if you use him. 

I don't think he needs a buff, but he does need a rework on his frustrating and one sided playstyle. I've had my fun with it, carrying games and all but sincerely most of time it was solely because of people not even trying to counter me with like a Zarya, Pharah-Mercy, Widow, etc.

OW2 CORE Problems? 5v5 or 6v6? Support 👩‍⚕️ > DPS ⚔️> Tank 🛡,"Since Devs teased a little (yet controversial) change to the game, let's discuss is it really THAT bad, or community is just overreacting?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/luo4lal921dc1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a282b6224d4c1e60939e704d311b7504ea01cdea

# 1. It's a TEAM BASED GAME

One of the main reasons of mass hate is that everyone out of sudden felt the TeAm SpiRiT in OW2 and got offended that their role (supps) is irrelevant now since there's self-heal for everyone. Let's be honest:

* **Team Based Idea is gone** when OW became 5v5 FPS. One tank is not enough to protect their team properly, now everyone survives as best they can. Second tank was always there to peel or do some flanking engagement when the other was shielding, so the rest of team were REALLY busy doing their respected role jobs. DPS were focusing on doing dmg, supports were pumping heals and E's to enable their tanks. THIS is where team based factor of game was thriving. Other question is was it good?
* **6v6 or 5v5?** 6v6 was incredibly team based but also very stagnant and boring. The amount of shields, cc abilities, GOAT... On the other hand there's 5v5, more amusing, dynamic but self-centered gameplay where any mistake of single player can drastically impact on the final outcome. Each has their own pros and cons. Frankly, it's hard to find a silver lining, and everyone might prefer one or another style (Maybe 5.5 v 5.5 would do better). This is where the core problem lies.
* **Comm Problems**. People point at 'team beased' feature but tend to play with randoms, w/o mic, refusing to switch to counter picks preferring their mains... I mean, guys, be real with yourself. If you're not playing with group of 5 chatting in discord and discussing comp and doing callouts, please, don't stutter about TeAmWoRk. Other than that is just a improvised adaptive play style, where no one switches and blame others anyway.

&#x200B;

# 2. TANK, DPS, SUPPORTS whining complaints

* **TANKS**. Since there's only 1 tank, the first thing is it's UNfun for tanks to experience the game. While other roles can compensate weak parts of their collegue, tanks DON'T have such privileges. They have to switch to counter or to adapt to their own team. Thus, they usually forget about maining DVA or Ball, and switch to counter tank. Second part of the problem is that they strongly rely on other 2 roles, while these roles don't actually care since their high mobility and sustainability. Overall tank experience is great, if you ignore the fact of winning games and protecting your team. Core problem of tanks is the absence of 2nd tank to comfort their playstyle.
* **DPS**. Universally, this role is in optimal state, except maybe some horrible ultimates and overall obsolete ability kit. Main problems of the role lies in the other role (yes, supports). All they can do, supports can do better (most of them), and additionally they can heal, survive, safely disengage. Why you gotta be precise Widowmaker, search for good spot, have 175 hp when there's Kiriko that pops out of nowhere, cleanses your venom mine, two taps you in close distant, parcour the f outta there and then heals herself. Not to exaggerate, but it do be like that sometimes. But actually, it's not even supports' fault, the same reason is that they were designed in 6v6 game mode, and they were mostly busy healing 2 tanks rather than dealing dmg by themself.
* **SUPPORTS**. The problem of this role is that it's 2 edged sword. You either give them powerful abilities so they can survive against crazy DPS role and be immortal, or weaken these abilities but they become easy prey and useless. Non of these changes will make everyone satisfied, buff Supps = DPS and Tank cry, nerf Supps = Useless supps cry. Again, problem is in the lack of 2nd tank to protect them. The Supports role itself hard in OW2 since they have to manage a LOT of things at the same time: to heal, to save, to do dmg, to survive themselves, and everyone blames them at the end. So we got high sustainable heroes that deal (not as good as DPS, but still) decent damage, but the main reason they're good at duels with DPS is their survival abilities that give them extra lives to cover their mistakes.

&#x200B;

# 3. Changes to numbers are not enough!

People HAVE to understand that the sole number tweaking is not enough. There still will be balance problems, some heroes will be thriving, while other gotta be in F-tier.

There should deffinetely be changes, CORE changes to the game. Since the heroes and gameplay initially were designed in 6v6 environment, it's clear now that some roles are hardly fitting in present 5v5 state. They're either OP or trash.

&#x200B;

# 4. SOLUTIONS

In my opinion EVERYONE should have a great and fun experience in game\*, EACH role. You have to stop being egoistic one-role trick main, and think about other people and roles.\*

*Here are some fast ideas of how to solve the role balance problem (just author's ideas):*

&#x200B;

* **TANKS** should get increased base movement speed. Reduced incoming critical hit damage. (These might be good for tank's self survivability, and making them potentially dangerous to get closer)
* **DPS** should get small self healing passive and increased damage boost when they're under 30-40% of their health.
* **SUPPORTS** should agree that their current state is unhealthy for game, but to leave it that way Blizzard HAVE to buff other roles passive.
* Implement new core game feature **""Ult exchange""**. The idea is that every player can exchange uncharged ult-bar points to get some boosts. Limited to 3 times per match, and increasing in cost after each use. Each role has unique boosts when using:-
* &#x200B;

1. Tank. Have their HP immediately healed up to 300\~400 hp-

* 2. DPS. Boost their damage by 10\~20%-
* 3. Supports. Increase their speed of movement and CD reduction timer.

For people that would say it's imbalanced, again, it reduces ULT bar points percentage based, in exchange for such boosts.

Victorian era Widowmaker,"Greetings OW community 

This is my concept art for a Victorian era skin. 

Widow is my second entry for this concept idea.

Below is the description of the skin. Please let me know what do you think? Thank you

""In the enigmatic alleyways of gaslit Victorian streets, emerges the mysterious figure known as Widowmaker, a haunting presence with a steampunk allure. Clad in ornate attire that seamlessly melds the opulence of the Victorian era with the intricate aesthetics of steampunk, she is the embodiment of elegance and lethality.

Widowmaker's eyes, once filled with life, now glow with an otherworldly intensity as she peers through the lens of her infrasight. This advanced optical device, a masterpiece of steam-driven engineering, grants her the ability to pierce through shadows, revealing the secrets hidden within the murky corners of her surroundings.

Her weapon of choice, a steam-powered rifle, echoes with the hiss of escaping steam as it readies itself for a deadly shot. 

Adorned with brass embellishments and intricate clockwork mechanisms, the rifle embodies the fusion of Victorian craftsmanship and futuristic innovation. 

Each pull of the trigger unleashes a precise burst of steam-driven power, leaving her adversaries ensnared in a deadly dance of gears and shadows.

Widowmaker moves with a haunting grace, her every step echoing the sophistication of a bygone era. The cobblestone streets bear witness to her silent approach, as she navigates the labyrinth of gears and contraptions that lie concealed beneath the surface of the Victorian world.

A figure shrouded in mystery, Widowmaker traverses the delicate balance between the elegance of the past and the enigmatic power of the future.

 In this steampunk-infused Overwatch universe, she is the embodiment of a bygone era's allure, a lethal enforcer weaving her destiny through the intricate tapestry of time and technology.""",Overwatch,1705507656.0,t3_19903zk

So what’s the incentive or thing to work towards if I don’t have the battle pass or play comp?,"If I don’t want to spend money for the battle pass, or the battle pass has nothing that interests me there’s nothing to work towards there. 

If I play a certain character and want a skin I have to pay for it now instead of overtime being able to purchase it. 

I don’t see a reason to play comp cause still many matches seem to be either steamrolled one sided matches, not all and it has improved since launch but still enough to where I don’t want to work towards it just to gamble each time if this match will be like that or not.

Aside from still enjoying the core gameplay there’s really no incentive for anything (in my opinion) 

I miss Overwatch 1, the loot boxes cause I feel like I’d actually get some reward, 6v6 for the reason of having a group before and now having to leave someone for QP or comp.

What if Iggy became a playable character?,"So, I posted yesterday a question what future heroes you'd like to have in the game. I mentioned I'd like Iggy because she has a very good character design (imo), although I haven't read the London calling comic yet. My understanding of her is that she is a leader of sort for the Omnics in King's Row, but also that she has taste for rock themed music.

I did my own concept of what her kit could look like as I was bored. However I do think it's unique and may fit her character while provide good value to the team.

Name: Iggy

Health: 200

Armor: 25

Weapon: Dual sidearm

Ammo: 15 rounds per sidearm (30 in total)

Weapon damage: 10 per hit (20 if both sidearm hit)

Role: Dps

Ability 1: [60's punk] Iggy amp up her music, increase her reload speed and movement speed with 10% and gains a +7,5hp/s for 6s. 
Cooldown: 8 seconds 

Ability 2: [Electro-rock] Iggy charge her dual sidearm for 7s, each shot deal electric damage which deal 5dmg/s for 3s. As well increase her rate of fire with 5%. She deal 1.3% extra dmg against shields and -0.5% against armor.
Cooldown: 11 seconds 

Ultimate: [Rock 'n' Roll] Iggy create an 10m shockwave which grants her and nearby allies +300 overhealth for 4s, as well increase Iggy's damage x2 for 6s. 

Now I am not very skilled enough to understand the game and all. However with what knowledge I have and what I believe would make a interesting and new gameplay experience for a new hero. I think it could be a fun concept. What do you think of this?",Overwatch,1705502539.0,t3_198y37i

Doomfist Buff?,"TL; DR
Power Block gains knockback resistance. Empowered Rocket Punch gains additonal DoT. Rising Uppercut readded weaker and on a long cooldown.

**To clarify, Seismic Slam and Meteor Strike stays the same, they aren't removed.**

**Power Block**

Any negative status effect received in the state will be applied with half the potency. You sleep or get stunned half as long, you get knockback half as much, among other status effects.

Using Power Block leaves Doomfist in a vulnerable position to receive a javelin in the face, slept, anti-ed, pinned, hooked with other miscellaneous effects. So having additional CC resistance would put Doomfist on par with every other tank which can block CC, with a few exceptions being able to heal themselves instead.

Being the only defensive ability for Doomfist as a tank, it is lackluster. Being CCed out of Power Block usually results death.

**Rocket Punch**

Empowered Rocket punch will deal an additional 20-80 damage depending on charge, over 4 seconds to the first enemy it hits which doesn't include blastback.

The additional damage is capable of dealing 200 damage in total, with a fully charged empowered punch, assuming that they do not get healed over the time of 4 seconds which is an unlikely case and rather should be used as extra damage to help secure eliminations on isolated targets in conjunction with his other damage sources.

It also gives more fear and consideration into playing around his empowered punch as current players don't really care about the difference between a normal and an empowered punch.

**Add Rising Uppercut**

Just the original Rising Uppercut but with no AOE, 30 damage and on a 14 second cooldown, alternatively it can share the same cooldown as Rocket Punch instead. The ability can be bound to reload or jump to prevent too many abilities like in the case of the release of Lifeweaver.

Being the mobile tank Doomfist is, he gains unorthodox strengths and weakness. Less blocking damage for the team, more disturbing and reaching enemy backlines. It is not intended to be a vertical Rocket Punch, rather a tool to traverse the map or in niche cases hold a singular target in place for a short time to get some damage in with Hand Cannon and of course gain minor overhealth.

A necessity or not, a good number of Doomfist players would welcome the additional option in their gameplay. The avaliability of Rising Uppercut should be limited as giving him too much mobility and disruptive ability will make it not great for enemy player experience.

**Conclusion**

While it may be true Doomfist's ultimate is weaker compared to his tank counterparts, where other tanks have ultimates which can change the course of the game, Doomfist has the ability to change the course of the game with his 3 abilities alone, or at least that's how I think he is intended to be.

These changes would likely make Doomfist strong, but I hope that my concepts does not make him oppressive. **Just a fun post by me on what could've been.**",Overwatch,1705490269.0,t3_198u9tc

"Hot Drops have a major flaw, making some deals overpriced compared to previous bundles.","Looking at some of the deals its seems like respawn made a sweeping price point per item making some bundles more expensive before the discount and even some after the discount.

Each item is priced at what each item rarity is supposedly worth (An epic item is 1000, a legendary is 1800, etc.) So a 2 item legendary bundle would orginally cost 3600 coins even if in previous bundles with the same items it was worth somewhere closer to 2250. Some of these discounts make the bundles still more expensive than the orginal bundle price, mostly with the epic rarity bundles and a few of the legendary ones. 

Definitely seems like a major oversight and could absolutely be considered scummy by abusing fomo mechanics if this is the intended pricing scheme.",apexlegends,1706037912.0,t3_19dwkbc

It was *interesting* to watch you push a fight all on your own against a full team an entire POI away from where we landed, having only grabbed a single weapon and some ammo off of drop. It was exciting to work with our third to get your banner and res you! It’s too bad our third died for the sake of rezzing you too, but we eventually got him back 😊

I was surprised to see (jk, it didn’t surprise me one bit) that you decided to push yet another fight on your own - and into zone, no less! - with naught but your now two weapons and white shield. Later we would learn, after somehow being able to revive you, that you had no meds to make it through to the next zone!

All of this was done with absolutely no communication, not even a single ping!, on your part. It was only when you finally did die to zone that you decided to call us brain dead losers. I’ve gotta admit, that one hurt a bit (/s).

Apex Legends FPS Drops,"So here is basically my problem. If you know a possible fix, thank you in advance:

I have bought a new PC approximately 6 months ago. Apex was one of the first games I downloaded and played ever since.

Up until 1 month ago there was no big problem I was playing with good fps and having month. However, within the last month, I have this problem:  
1- My fps is down by 10  
2- When I first open the game, I have severe stuttering/fps drops at a point it is impossible to play. After a while it seems it passed for a short time but then, it is unplayable again. During this ""drop"" phase I generally see various of red warning signs on the right side of the screen.

My system specs: HM Omen Gaming Laptop 16  
Processor: intel i7-13700HX  
RAM: 16 gb  
OS: Windows 11 Home 23H2  
SSD: 1TB (Half is empty)  
GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU (Integrated)  
Display: 240Hz with 1440p

In other games (Finals and CS2) there is no problem of this sort. So, I am lost. FYI, the fixes I tried so far:  
Changed the nvidia control panel settings to only use the Nvidia GPU and changed some 3D settings to increase the performance (I changed them back to default)  
Tried every different in game setting in Apex  
My drivers are updated  
I set background apps off  
I changed to directx12 Apex settings but it did not seem to solve the problem.  
I have deleted OmenGamingHub and LightStudio (some 3rd party apps of HP) because they were using so much of RAM.  
I have played with LogitechGHub closed because I saw somewhere that it lowers the performance however, it did not work for me.  
I deleted and downloaded the game.  
I verified the game files through steam (Before and after reinstalling the game)

If you know anything that I can try, please say so as I don't have any more ideas to try (or why this problem is happening). Thank you all.",apexlegends,1706003793.0,t3_19dkzfs

Stuttering/Freezing on brand new PC?,"I recently upgraded from a 1060 3GB to a brand \[new\]([https://imgur.com/aIfhwmT](https://imgur.com/aIfhwmT)) PC, however, my old PC never had issues running Apex.  Granted I was using the lowest settings possible, but still.  Now, this new PC stutters and is generally choppy, as if I was playing at 30 fps. 

Things I've tried that have *not* worked, from various forum posts/videos:

\- Uninstalled/Reinstalled the game

\- Verified integrity of game files

\- Set priority to High in launch options

\- Disabled ingame overlay from GeForce Experience

\- When that didn't work, uninstalled GeForce Experience entirely

\- Lowered Mouse Polling Rate from 1000 to 500

\- Lowered all graphical settings to absolute lowest

\- Disabled V-Sync Ingame, enabled in NVIDIA Control Panel

\- G-Sync is enabled

\- Used DirectX12 launch options, no change in performance

\- Checked ""Disable fullscreen optimizations"" under Properties --> Compatibility in the gamefile

Crypto buff pls,"Hello! I have an idea to make Crypto a stronger pick for the 14 of us that main him.
Nothing crazy just a little something.

A new addition where once hack is deployed, player can hold their ability button(or something like that) to toggle 'modes' on hack.

Now, you've got the basic 'send it to hit a wall and it faces outward,' basically a sentry, so this would be 'sentry mode.' Where it's basically that, hack sits somewhere and scans outward.

Next is 'hover mode,' which makes hack fly above crypto, making it easier to be shot, but scanning any enemies within 15 or so metres, of course this would be limited by buildings, which is why it's only useful for specific scenarios. (If that's too good, maybe make a limit on how long it stays in the mode before returning to sentry mode)

Finally, is 'patrol mode.' This would do something along the lines of making hack move side to side within a set distance, say 50 metres, just slowly patrolling back and forth, or something like that.

I'm not much of a creative mind but I definitely think something like this would help crypto a good bit.",apexlegends,1705975662.0,t3_19dd9m3

Make it so the game also factors in how much shields Evo/Body Shields have as well as their level. Or make it like it is with attachments, where if you have a better one equipped you have to use the Alternate Interact button to pick it up. 

Shields that are higher level and have more shields: Interact

Shields that are lower level and have more shields: Interact

Shields that are higher level but have less shields: Alternate Interact

"Apex Legends super stuttery/laggy, no clue what the problem is","I can't seem to figure out this laggy/stuttering situation on my new 2023 ASUS Zephyrus M16.

It's running:

\-Intel i9 13th gen -RTX 4080 -48GB RAM DDR5 -1TB SSD -Using KTC H27S17 165hz gaming monitor

All settings are maxed out. Even if I lower the settings the stutter continues. All drivers updated (windows, Nvidia, Intel integrated, any peripheral apps, etc). I've tried deleting the graphics setting profiles etc (C:\\Users\\zeta0\\Saved Games\\Respawn\\Apex\\local). I've tried limiting the amount of apps running on theGPU and setting the rest to the integrated GPU. It happens when settings are either Silent, Performance and Turbo mode.

This isn't really happening on other games I've test (The Finals, Witcher 3, Counterstrike 2, etc).

CPU and GPU temps are normal during gameplay. CPU around 80c, and GPU 68c. Doesn't appear to be bottlenecking/throttling. FPS is consistantly 100-120.

Caustic Discussion,"How does everyone feel about caustic as of late? I am a long time caustic main but I do understand the reasoning behind his previous nerfs.

There is one thing I never understood, a long time ago, caustic and Bangalore were affected by a density bug that made their gas/smoke much easier to see through. Bangalore's smokes were fixed, but caustic gas was not, as the devs liked the gas being thinner.

Having thicker gas would be a really nice buff right now, for what I would argue is the weakest controller legend. I do think he's just one small push away from being in a good spot personally, but I'd love to hear what non-caustic players think of him right now.",apexlegends,1705927608.0,t3_19cuv4t

Killcam. I don't understand why I am bad," I will begin by sharing my experience before delving into the discussion about the killcam at the end of this post. I consider myself an average FPS player – not a pro, but certainly not a novice. With over 700 hours invested in Apex and an equal amount in Overwatch, where I achieved a platinum rank, I've also played extensively in other FPS games like PUBG and COD. Equipped with mid/high-tier hardware, I use a mouse and keyboard setup with a consistently strong internet connection. Apex has always stood out to me due to its mechanics, and I've been playing it since Season 1.

However, my relationship with Apex has taken an unexpected turn. In my earlier days, I would acknowledge my mistakes, aiming to improve my gameplay – a process often driven by unfamiliarity with weapons, game situations, and a need for enhanced aiming skills. The introduction of crossplay, though, brought about a new layer of frustration during matches. There were instances where I would shoot at an unsuspecting or distracted target from behind, landing nearly every shot, only for them to swiftly turn around and eliminate me within seconds.

Not every encounter resulted in frustration; there were times when I knowingly engaged in melee combat, accepting the imminent defeat. However, it's in those instances where I anticipate having an advantage that I am left bewildered as the outcome swiftly turns into a defeat.  In contrast, games like Overwatch rarely presented such challenges – when I sensed an advantage, I seldom lost a fight. So to better understand these perplexing situations in Apex, I started spectating the players who killed me. Strangely, I often found their aim to be inferior to mine. 

Recently, with the introduction of **killcams**, I hoped to gain insight into what went wrong. Unfortunately, watching these killcams only intensified my confusion. The reliability of these killcams remains uncertain, as I frequently encounter replays where my assailant misses more shots than I do, or situations where their aim falters at the beginning, the suddenly get better and execute a series of perfect shots with peculiar and unlinear movements.

In conclusion, despite my extensive gameplay hours, a clear understanding of my skills, and the ability to distinguish between novices and pro players, I consistently find myself in situations where I struggle to comprehend why I was outmatched, especially now with the added perspective from killcams. I'm curious if others in the community share this sense of bewilderment during their gameplay.",apexlegends,1705924038.0,t3_19ctu2v

My experience with players on Apex,"The two experiences I had with players on VC were direct opposites. First seemed to be a kid and honestly was super cool and nice, I didn’t talk to him but he was helping out the third person in our trio and was encouraging them on, was just a nice experience esp for a noob like me. This was one of my first games and I’m a people-pleaser so I was super stressed about messing up, but it was super chill. We actually made it pretty far too. 

So after that I left my mic on… well, until I met the second person with a mic-

The second was this dude who asked if we had mics and I said yes- and then immediately started complaining and trash talking. It was almost funny. We literally landed and I moved away slightly to grab some loot and he immediately started swearing up and down about how stupid I was and how he “always gets people who don’t wanna do teamwork” (ironic considering he wasn’t being a very nice team member) like whatever happened to “hello”. Then we got ambushed and died and ofc he starts trying to antagonize me, telling me it was my fault and taking down to me. Like “oh so how did your little solo adventure go for you” like if you don’t stfu boy I was two feet away from you. Bro literally thought he was some sort of military commander, like you’re playing fake war games in ur moms basement it’s not that deep honestly. I said one word and suddenly it’s beat Bobby flay level of cooking (except bro did not cook bro left the stove off and beat everyone else with a pan)

So I just left cuz I ain’t putting up with that sh*t. No more mic for me. Can’t say I’m really surprised though. But tbh I’ve come across way less toxic/annoying people than on most other games. 

All in all, most people seem to be pretty good at teamwork and that makes me glad, because I think it’s just a lot more fun playing with a team than on your own. Only really had one dude who just completely abandoned our squad and left us for dead. 
It’s good when there’s at least one player who knows what they are doing (not me) so I can just follow them around. 

I still dread being the jump master, though. It sucks. I always relinquish it but twice it ended up coming back to me. I never have any idea where to land and then the other people start suggesting places and I’m like… bro why didn’t you just make us land there in the first place. 

I think the team mechanics are implemented quite nicely and you really don’t need a mic or anything to communicate effectively. Which I think most games lack. It just makes it so much easier to have a good time. I feel like most game’s basically force you to use a mic or else everyone in the team hates you. Also, I like the little “thanks” option- makes me feel like a pure hearted soul.

Probably will never happen at this point but wanted to share my take on Kuben Blisk coming to apex as a legend.,"Blisk: The Original Predator

Passive: Apex Agression - as Blisk deals damage he builds up agression (as seen above your weapon hud). The more agression he has the faster he moves. Decays overtime

Tactical: Jump kit dash - briefly activate your pilot jump kit to dash in the direction you are moving. If you slide at the end you can keep your momentum. This ability has three charges that has a short delay between each one.

Ultimate: Survival of the Best - target a low health enemy in close range and dash towards them, knocking them prone and attempt to execute them, instantly killing them and bypassing the downed state. If an enemy damages you in this state the execution will be canceled but the target will be left in the downed state.

""Its simple. You kill me? You're better. I kill you? I'm better."" - Champion intro line and possible select line.

""I guess we know who's better."" - Kill line

""Oi, don't feel to bad. Not every day a legend faces a myth."" - Kill line",apexlegends,1705900808.0,t3_19co5r6
How to 'See' better in Apex,"I have a friend who plays, and I watch him share his screen relatively often when I am eating. Among the things he needs to learn to get better, one of the biggest things just seems to be that he doesn't see enemies very well. If an enemy is anywhere at all on my screen, I have a 99.999% chance of seeing them, sort of like how you expect eyes to work. But my friend seems to only be able to notice about 75% of enemies on his screen. If they are not 100% super mega easy and obvious to see, there's a decent chance he misses them completely, and then will turn his back to look at something else and then die to being shot in the back. I know this post will mainly get troll replies or no replies, but if there is any advice anyone has about what to tell him or how to train your eyes to see enemies better, I would love to hear them. He has gotten better at many aspects of the game, but I am at a loss as to how to teach him to notice enemies better. And until he does, he will always be stuck with the phrase ""WHERE DID HE COME FROM?!?"" on his lips.",apexlegends,1705897128.0,t3_19cn13l

Apex Legends Character Concept: Fracture,"Name: Fracture. 
Role: Assault.  
  
PASSIVE: Last Chance: When you’re downed, you can use your custom semi-auto pistol to damage enemies. Any kill or down will automatically revive you with 30 hp.   
  
TACTICAL: Rewind: Place a Teleportation pad that you can teleport back to at any time. Max distance of 40 meters. (25 second cooldown).
  
ULTIMATE: Pain Cycle: After a 6 second charge, you will deal 85 damage to all enemies within a 35 meter radius, at the cost of downing yourself. Any downs or kills made with the ultimate will not trigger the passive. If you don’t damage anyone with the ultimate, you won’t be downed. (2:15 minute cooldown).  
  
ADDITIONAL INFO:  
   
PASSIVE: -The pistol you use has similar stats to a P2020. 
  
-you can switch between using your knockdown shield and your pistol. You can’t.  use both at the same time.    
  
-click your tactical button while downed to switch between the knockdown shield and the pistol.  
  
-to prevent the passive being used recklessly, the enemy who downed you will be immune to the pistol for 3 seconds.   
  
TACTICAL: -You click your tactical button to place the Teleportation pad. You click it again while the pad is placed to teleport to the pads location.  
  
- The tactical is similar to vantages tactical. If your tactical is off cooldown and is in range, it will be colored blue. If it’s on cooldown, it’ll be orange. If it’s out of range, it will be red.  
  
- you can recall the pad at any time.  
  
ULTIMATE: -If you miss your ultimate, and no enemies are damaged, you won’t be downed, and 25 percent of your ultimate will be refunded.  
  
- during the 6 second charge time, enemies will be notified that they are in the ultimates range.  
  
-Your teammates will be slowed down by the ultimate, instead of damaged.",apexlegends,1705889377.0,t3_19ckjjc

And now they want to impliment line of sight to the traps? In my eyes thats with the throwing nerf the worst neft they coud have done. The thing that makes the traps so good is that they are not only traps but also indicators when enemies are close, now we have to see how thats working out.

Stutters and Lag,Hey everyone. I used to play apex back like 2 years ago and I just came back this year on pc and I never dropped under the 144 frame cap. My specs are (I3 12100f and an RX6650XT). According to the benchmarks with these specs are supposed to give me around 170+ fps on average and that's what I used to get. One of my ram sticks became faulty tho and now I'm on 8gb of ram and now when I open the game the maximum frame rate I get is about 105 with a very janky frame time graph so as you can probably guess I have a shit ton of stuttering. I've seen people run 8gb comfortably and according to YouTube benchmarks I dont think my ram should be bottleneck me that much.

Thanks to Conduit I am happy to return to Apex. Conduit is missing piece of a puzzle this game needed.,"I always found difficult to play Apex Legends because of the sweats and match making. No matter how much I practice in terms of work-life-hobby balance (NOT playing each day 18 hours), I mostly end up being dead in 1-2 minutes of gameplay or being loot goblin for 10 minutes and then dying instantly making someone happy with all the loot I had.

Instead of improving aim and movement (requires a lot of time that I can't afford to waste because of job, family, hobbies) I always wanted to be a better support player. Active healer, or active teleporter to safety or something.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, many support legends still required offensive gameplay. Lifeline? Yeah you can heal... If your teammate and you survived the sweats. Revive? Try to defend lol. Loba? Well... What's the point in looting if you die after that quickly.

&#x200B;

But with Conduit... I like this one! I actually can HELP during a fight. I can heal shields quickly and give needed support. Even middle skilled player can have a chance against sweat with additional shields.

And oh boy, having those shields through the walls and with this distance... I think Conduit is a healthy addition to the game that was starting to die out for casual players because of the sweats (I play the game more than 3 years and I can say that 2-3 years ago I was not obliterated THAT quickly like nowadays).",apexlegends,1705853897.0,t3_19c6x0t

Firing range update ideas,"The dummies could be set to play out and movement ability.

-A dummy takes an octane jump pad for example and we can practice gaining accuracy for shooting someone who’s moving at that speed or midair.
Horizons lift and pathfinders ziplines as well.

- The firing range could also basically be upgraded to the level of Halo ODSTS fire fights. Waves of enemy’s keep coming with their abilities and shield levels rising as you kill more. (We can summon actual legends to fight against)

- Maybe even a dummy who you can use finishers on 

-I know that the firing range was updated a few seasons ago and it’s impressive as is. These were just a few suggestions I had, anybody have thoughts or ideas that come to mind?",apexlegends,1705825390.0,t3_19byr5u

enjoy the game.,"so... this may be clutter or redundant, but i just wanted to say:
please try and enjoy the game; there is no need to get bogged down in the hate or constant accusations of cheaters. the game is good----movement is unmatched. dont think when you die, ""oh, he was cheating."" but instead think, ""oh, i shouldv've done x or y better.""

sure ea sucks and they can do better, but focusing on others is always the wrong way... because it is mostly out of your control. sure post glitches or additions you think would make the game better, but hate only brews more hate. 

Apex is the best BR out there and, again, the movement is unmatched. and if it does not grant you the fun or result you want then find other games....

i really do not know purpose of this post other than i am disappointed in gaming culture and communities in general and there is so much negativity in every gaming subreddit/community.

be the change you want; actualize the vision you percieve the gamestate should be.

anyways... goodluck and have fun.
much love.",apexlegends,1705824471.0,t3_19byj2y

I actually love team deathmatch and love this map, but I think it is bugged.  Every time this map is on rotation I get excited (or used to), but it doesn't ever actually connect.  I just sit while it makes the connect sound and says connecting, then goes back to matchmaking repeatedly.  It happens every time with this map, and happened on another team deathmatch map recently, and just cycles through failing to connect for the entire block.

Things that I think would improve the game,"1. Matchmaking. This one is talked a lot about so I wouldn't elaborate too much.
2. Cosmetics unlockable by completing challenges. If all Respawn/EA cares about is engagement they could implement this system as it could give us players a further goal and a reason to actually keep playing the game. This could, if implemented effectively result in more people playing the game thus boosting the player count.
3. A new playlist which rotates between past LTMs. Due to an increased player count Respawn could implement a new playlist without affecting already existing playlists too much. This could give the people who want to play a specific LTM they missed out on an opportunity to experience it. In addition the playlist could be the place all future LTMs override removing the possibility of any complaints from a takeover event.

Buster sword should change your game strategy,"If you drop in a poi next to a poi with a buster sword, don’t venture off to that poi alone.  
Also be prepared to die in close combat. 
The sword is so op, it completely changes confrontations.   
Even though I prefer shooting people and detest the sword, I’m going for it on drop out of pure necessity. 
In doing so, I’m wiping the first enemy confrontation like 90% of the time.  Especially if the other squad has dropped in the same poi. 
If my team doesn’t get the “Thing”,  you have to take into account the melee reach is more than twice the distance of a punch and the lurch is way faster. 
Gotta really push your movement skills to put some space between you and the op sword.  This may sound like obvious advice, but remember that when they put up the sword shield, they take absolutely no damage. 
So fire a short burst to get them to put up the shield, then either use that moment to get some high ground or more distance or time their shield drop when firing. 
Other than Revs alt, there is no other time when it’s smart to do this, and Rev is actually taking damage.  Thus, the completely different game strategy for Apex.

Question from a returning player,"When apex first came out, i played it constantly. At the time I was on console & I was pretty good, winning a fair chunk of games, getting high kills etc

nearly 5 years on I've returned to the game but on PC with KB&M, thought I'd give ranked a try and got placed Rookie 4/0 LP, which is fine, I think I deserved that

I am solo q only and I'm wondering if these observations continue in the higher ranks or is this something I'll have to live with as a solo q'r

\- SO many octane & revenant players who want to hot drop, take every single fight even when ill prepared & when they die after trying to 1v3/1v6 they spam ping and blame you/the team

\- Playing as conduit, no one seems to take advantage of the shield boost

\- No one comms

\- Should I be playing conduit in solo q at this rank?

\- What other meta legends should I try to learn? (tried a tiny bit of Catalyst)

\- Assuming wingman x peacekeeper combo isn't meta anymore, I've been using mostly havoc & nemesis

\- does the LP you earn change based on rank, for example. Lets say I have a 5 kill win and I get 350LP in silver, when I get to diamond, will those same stats offer me less LP?

Any other advice for solo q climbing will be grateful!",apexlegends,1705750648.0,t3_19b9wys

low 99% FPS in game sometimes,"I recently got a new computer and in most games, it runs completely fine with high fps and 99% fps however in apex the fps is at 260 - 300 while the 99% fps is around 150 - 200 (still high but is really inconsistent which makes the game feel bad). it also frequently drops to like 20 or 30. If anyone has any fixes i'd really appreciate it.

(I've lowered my graphics as much as I can and it doesn't seem to do anything, I have also set a startup command which sets the fps max at 160 which makes it slightly better)

My Take On How To Better Apex,"Ranked: bring back how s13 worked during split 1but keep promotion matches. also please remove heat shields from ranked similar to algs  


LTMs: please instead of takeovers just make it a separate mode. when i want to play with my friends who are new i want to teach them apex not an LTM  


* Conduit: make the tactical heal using her shield health or make it so it can only heal 50 shields
* Bangalore: nothing. her most appealing factor imo is that smokes counteract aim assist 
* Bloodhound: Please have blood ult give constant scans like it used to if the scans are 1second full body.
* Horizon: Shorter tactical duration and/or weaker pull on ult. p.s please fix her audio
* Valkyrie: Make her a controller. just my take but she doesn't need care package scans where her ult is a evac tower
* Seer: Give back fast heartbeat scans and increase range to 60 meters at least. for tactical, the scans should be 5 seconds. for ult, let the throw range be 25-30 meters and give back diamond scans for moving enemies and add footprints for crouching enemies.
* Loba: MAKE HER TACTICAL CONSISTANT PLEASEEE
* Catalyst: make her ult blind/slow for less time  


ok that's all for now. please share your input as well :)

Leaving penalties in unraked (OCE),"The reason I specified OCE is because it is impossible to get a ranked game in OCE, I don't know why but people just don't play ranked. I'm having to go to Singapore severs every time I want to play ranked, and it becomes unenjoyable because my ping goes to 200. Which is where all the early leaving penalties are.

Everyone knows leaving early is bad in Apex but it is horrendous in OCE servers, I've had so many people that will leave while they're still alive because our other teammate has left or gone down (while I'm still alive as well). There isn't enough of a penalty for leaving early. I report all of them but because it's unranked I doubt it matters. There should at least be a 3 minute cool down timer, and it grows with each early leave the person does per day.

I've played maybe 10 games today, every single game has had someone leaving early.",apexlegends,1705726626.0,t3_19b3txp
Apex Legends Character Concept:,"Pls don’t be rude or hateful to me or anyone in the comments. I enjoy reading feedback as long as it’s appropriate and respectful. Ty :D!  
  
Name: Overdrive. 
Role: Skirmisher. 
  
PASSIVE: Hard-wired: Reload your weapons and move faster for 6 seconds after your shield is broken.  
  
TACTICAL: Dash: Move 15 meters very quickly in any direction. (20 second cooldown).  
  
ULTIMATE: Dash Tunnel: Create a 45 meter long Tunnel in any direction that anyone can use. You can open and close the tunnel’s entrance at any time. Lasts for 30 seconds.  
(90 second cooldown).  
  
ADDITIONAL INFO:  
  
PASSIVE: - The passive won’t activate again until the previous 6 second timer is over. Meaning if you get your shield cracked twice in 6 seconds, the time won’t restart.  
  
-The passive lets you reload your guns and move 20% faster.  
  
TACTICAL: - The dash will break any doors that are in its way.   
  
- The Dash has a 1.5 second charge time before it activates.  
  
- The dash is NOT like a wraith phase. You can still be damaged while dashing, however you’d be really hard to track.  
  
- It takes roughly 1.5 seconds to reach the full 15 meters.  
   
- Like wraiths “Into the void” ability, you can’t use weapons for a short period of time after exiting the dash.   
  
- The Tactical goes the direction your moving. For example, if you’re moving backward, the dash will take you fifteen meters backwards. If your not moving, or moving forward, you go forward. If your moving to the side, you’ll go to the side.  
  
-when moving forward, the tactical will go where you are looking. So if you’re looking up, you’ll go fifteen meters up. If you’re looking down, you’ll go fifteen meters down, etc.  
  
ULTIMATE: - The ultimate would be roughly as fast as an ash ult. However you can move back and forth.   
  
- Closing the tunnel entrance will kick anyone in it out instantly.   
  
- You can’t close the Tunnel when you are using it.  
  
- you get an audio cue when an enemy is using your Tunnel.  
  
- Like the Tactical, the Tunnel can go in any direction, depending on where you’re moving and looking.

What are some tricks you fall for when an enemy is playing your main?,"I'll start off with myself as an example. I'm a Rampart main, and I always like locking building downs and waiting for enemies to kick down doors. They never expect me to pull out Shiela and this always guarantee me 1-2 knocks per door. If they somehow made it inside (e.g., grenade spam before entry), I'd normally have 1 amped cover in the back of the room for me to fall back to and make my last stand.

Yet, I still fall for other Ramparts (normally ones that are low) who rush into a building, block the door, and Shiela me down. There are hardly any Rampart players in pubs (besides the current event) that I don't have the reflexes to not kick down doors when other Ramparts are behind it.

Ping System > Mic,"You dont need mics to communicate effectively.

Your call outs take longer to process than a visual indicator, and are prone to misguidance . I.e. statements like ""they are low"", ""one shot"", ""they are here"", ""they are there"". It only serves to confuse.

In high stress situations why would you want people talking over the already almost non existent footsteps? Or even worse talking AND pinging (often spam pinging). You cant hear or see anything as teammates spam ping multiple enemy locations. 

And if you are going to use your mic. Make sure people can hear you well. Dont get mad because none of us can hear your call outs over the game. And no matter of raising your voice in stressful situations actually makes anyone try harder or somehow aim better. 

I say this because my best games have come from quiet games. No one is speaking. Pings are precise and not spammed. And my team is using all the types of pings to communicate.

My worst games often come from being confused in high stress scenarios. People talking, people pinging, and still no idea where the enemy is. Maybe skill issue, but I feel I'm not alone.",apexlegends,1705703656.0,t3_19avuuq

How to fix Vantage,"Vantage is a ""suvivalist sniper"" in the recon class that is barely picked across all game modes, ranks, and skill levels. She also has a 0% pick rate at a pro level. Overall, I think her kit is great and she is fun to play, but it's clear she needs some kind of buff or change to make her more viable. 

I would keep both her passive and tactical the same. The passive fits the recon class and is quite underrated in providing useful information through the Spotter's Lens. I would also keep her tactical echo location the same as it fits the sniper roll allowing her to reposition during fights. It is also quite balanced because she is has an absolute chonker hit box and the ability is slow to use - not like the instant-getaway mobility that skirmisher like horizon brings. 

IMO, the real issue with Vantage is her ultimate, sniper's mark. For starters, she is a mobile recon agent, so why give her a damage-dealing ultimate? The damage is very lackluster unless you hit multiple shots which are capped at 6. It's also so weak when guns like the 3030 are in the game that do more damage, are faster, and have more than 6 bullets.  The damage bonus mechanic is lackluster and rarely capitalized off of. The sniper in its current state also teeters between being weak and insanely OP. If they increased the damage per bullet or increased the multiplier duration, it could result in a really OP sniper or a really oppressive mechanic. Overall, it's just a bad design and needs to be changed. 

My suggestion to fix her Ultimate would be to remove/reduce the damage portion of the sniper and make it primarily a recon ability. If you tag someone with the sniper, it highlights the enemy to your entire team - similar to maggie's ability Warlord's Ire that highlights enemies she damages. If hit by the dart, the player can remove it by holding interact over 1-5 seconds, similar to removing a Cypher dart in Valorant. This not only makes the ability more in line with her recon class and role, it makes her more team-oriented and creates an interesting and similar dynamic to that of choosing to heal vs. fight as it would force players to stop and remove the dart, or keep it on risking that you are fully highlighted. It also rewards skill and accuracy and isn't just a press-a-button free wall hack ability like Seer/BH. I would also suggest they increase the handling and hip fire of the sniper greatly. I picture a super fast auto-rifle recon dart gun instead of a slow single-bolt sniper. You should be able to quickly tag, swap, and capitalize.

What do you think?

TLDR: Vantage is bad. Change her sniper ultimate to a recon dart that highlights the enemy for the whole team. Dart can be removed by holding a button like Cypher from Valorant. Buff the sniper's handling, speed, and hipfire. Decrease the damage or remove it entirely. Make Vantage an actual recon sniper that provides utility to the team.",apexlegends,1705699863.0,t3_19aucpb

Is the content of Youtuber LewiTrotter legit?,"I am quite new to Apex and was looking for some content to see how people approach fights etc.

I have stumbled onto this youtube channel by a guy named LewiTrotter. He is a pred player, mostly doing challenges for his channel (win with every legend within 24h, 20 bomb with every gun etc.). In the beginning I was amazed how he racks up those kills and gets to these fights.

However, after seeing other people's content and my own fights, I have started to wonder whether LewiTrotter is getting legit players of his caliber or just really low ranked players. 

Why am I saying this:

* In some instances the opponents simply don't shoot him or push him when he is low
* He seems to be able to use his Horizon Q to heal up fully, often right above the opponent's heads. If I did that, they'd beam me back to Valorant.
* During his challenge using all the legends, he doesn't seem to use the legend's ability well or at all. Is his gun fighting ability that good that he could basically play CS in Apex with no issue?

I lack the game knowledge to tell whether his lobbies are legit - other people seem to notice that too judging by his YT comments.

Seer needs to be Reworked but not Reborn,"I know I'm going to be crucified for this as most people hate Seer and want to keep him 6 feet under but hey, I think it might be better to toss the idea out there. I personally think Seer needs to start with a clean slate but not reborn. I love his legend fantasy of being the person who sees all but I think he's super overloaded with what his abilities do and would heavily benefit from being a little simplified. Here's how I would personally change him and this is from someone who loves to play Seer and love his ability to give great information, but hate how they keep hitting him back and forth like this making him unplayable when solo queuing and just worse than BloodHound when with a squad, albeit very deserved as he was actively making the game worse when he was strong.

Goal: Make him a much more information based legend. Make his scan the primary focus and make his tactical not do 1000 things all at once as it's the reason why he just can't be balanced. Nerf his passive without making it completely useless and buff his ultimate into being somewhat less situational.

HeartSeeker: Make him have to genuinely dedicate to his passive. Keep the beat rate thing that tells you if someoneis low on health. Give it a secondary indicator that tells you if there are multiple people with low health(ie. Two out of sync heartbeats, cap of 3). his passive while he has a gun out. Keep the passive's current accuracy(maybe even lower it) but make its range match his tactical. Make it much quieter. Remove the indicator that shows how close an enemy is(varying levels of how orange his ring is). Bring back his ability to sprint while using it. 

Focus of Attention: Make his tactical faster as it is way too easy for anyone with even 1/4 of a braincell to dodge it. Keep the silence but lower its duration to 5 seconds. Give it a pulsing scan that acts as a ping (Scan would stay stationary because having constant information is busted) every 2.5 seconds(2 scans). Keep the threat vision with line of sight as it should be good at countering smoke. And of course, remove the slow function that it has as its just unnecessary and overkill, same with the revealing of health and shields.

Exhibit: Keep his ultimate basically the same but give it the same pulse scan that I gave the tactical at a lower frequently due to its long duration, maybe once every 5 seconds. I actually like where his ultimate is at although it is rather weak in most place on the maps and would like a clearer indication of where everyone is, especially when in a more open area. When people shoot, you tend to already know where they are so I think it just needs a little pick-me-up.

This is just what I came up with for how I'd like to see him changed in the future but what would you guys personally do with him because I like seeing what other people would do to fix such a poorly designed and handled legend.

Loba passive rework idea,"I don't play Loba usually so I didn't realize how inconsequential her passive is. I guess it could help you in the first few minutes after landing but loses almost all value later on in the game.
Maybe instead of seeing purple and gold stuff through walls, purple stuff she equips has the same boosts as gold items do? Her purple mags reload themselves, her purple helmet makes her abilities load faster etc etc.
Don't really care if they implement it or not, just something I thought about and wanted to know what others thought about it. Would it be too broken? Or would it make her more viable?",apexlegends,1705637742.0,t3_19aaaht

I need the community to settle this!,"On storm point, playing as a 3 man squad, im the jump master and we drop hot at Echo HQ. A round or two before this I dropped within the HQ where the majority of the loot is and where they just removed the zip to the roof while the other two guys in my squad landed at the bins just outside where their is loot along and between the steps. I had died because I wasn’t close enough to them so I said alright next time if you guys want to drop outside HQ I will too. So back to - I’m jumpmaster, I go for HQ but land at the bins just outside, one of my teammates breaks off so he’s landing at the bin on one side of the steps and I’m landing at the bin on the other side of steps. My third teammate rides me all the way down never breaking loose, lands on the same pile and bin, then we both proceed forward under the overhang and I grab something and he shrieks “”BRO YOU ARE RAKING MY LOOT MAN I RAN AWAY SO YOU COULD LOOT” mind you this is literally the next closest pile and pretty much the most logical path to loot down otherwise I’d have landed somewhere else. I told him it’s ridiculous to stay with jumpmaster all the way to the ground and land on same pile and run the same direction and call that your loot, I said you are literally taking whatever loot is on that path and reducing the amount available to both of us, if you want to call it your loot then break off of me and land close enough to get in the same fights but far enough that we aren’t grabbing at the same loot bins and piles.


I was told I’m blind, I’m crazy, I’m being greedy, I messed him up.

"KD 1.25, average damage 500. started Apex in S19 but can't promote from Bronze.","I got hooked on this game with Apexmobile and started Apex for PC from S19!
Unlike mobile, there are no bots in the ranks which I find very exciting and enjoyable.
When I first started, I was unfamiliar with PAD operation as it was my first time, but after practicing for a considerable amount of time every day, I am now able to actually perform the moves that I have in my head.

However, the rank system is very severe and it is very difficult to be promoted.
Of course, there are difficulties because I have been playing solo for a long time because I don't have anyone I know on the PC version, but I keep the VC on all the time. However, 90% of the people don't wear VC. But I still keep talking on VC lol.

Here is my question.
I have been stuck in the bronze zone for about a week now, but when I look at the orbits, sometimes there are players in master or diamond orbits.
I usually don't win those matches.

I don't enjoy gaining points while hiding, so I basically do kill moves for fishermen and priority moves to secure the inside of the ring.

I am sure that is the key to improving my play skills as well.

Do you have any advice for me?
I thought I could at least aim for platinum, but anyway, the PC version of Apex is too difficult...

This ability can be deactivated and give its full charge back, if it takes no damage.

Deathbox Looting bug,"Me and Buddy have noticed over the last few days that looting deathboxes has sometimes been buggy, taking anything from a deathbox instantly closes the menu (we still get the item) and we have to reopen it again. Anything that requires a hold action is completely out of reach unless we removed the item it would be swapped for from our own inventory first. 

This hasn’t affected the majority of our games but when it does it starts about halfway through a match and ruins the flow of looting mid fight and often has screwed us over because of it.

How do you play Apex in 2024 without good aim?,"I used to play the game casually a few years ago, decided to get back into it because the gunplay seems fun but I’ve gone through well over 200 matches now and haven’t even gotten close to a win, the closest i’ve gotten was fourth squad alive.

Every other player is impossibly fast and I can’t even comprehend what I’m looking at, let alone aim and fire. The game just doesn’t really feel fun to play for me anymore if I stand no chance against players at even the “lowest” levels. After all, it doesn’t matter what my positioning is if I can’t land more than one shot before the enemy turns into a mosquito. My only luck so far is hitting someone with so much damage at once that they aren’t able to react themselves before I can shoot again and down them, but that’s only possible with a select few relatively rare guns.",apexlegends,1705591734.0,t3_199sp87
Hoping a dev can see this: massive crypto bug,"Unsure if this was posted already, but I feel like we should spread the word for these new crypto bugs which cost me the game.

1. Crypto drone can't open large doors anymore.Only regular doors. There's even the tooltip saying I can open the large doors, but spamming it nothing happens, which leads me to believe this is a real bug. I'm talking about the huge cargo doors like at command center on storm point, as well as the ones that slide up like at harvester on WE.

2. Crypto drone can't steal an already active respawn beacon. Arguably, this could have been an exploit they wanted to get rid of, but I really wish it was still in the game. I used to do this all the time and abuse the fact there's no loading bar for crypto when he is respawning his allies, but an enemy team was respawning their teammate at the respawn beacon, and I couldn't use the beacon. Extremely frustrating as it ended up being a 1v3 because I couldn't drop my teammates back in, and they got both their teammates back in.

3(not a big deal), but it seems like with certain crypto skins, his sword loads in like under him by 6 feet when dropping and the gun drags on the floor. I’m sure this is just where the image of the weapon is, cuz I can still headglitch, so I really think it’s just the coordinates the frames are assigned to, but the actual bullets and gun/gameplay are fine.",apexlegends,1705591528.0,t3_199smen

In mixtape you can truly see the immense skill difference between players. Is movement for PC players that much better?,"I've been playing more mixtape modes lately and the incredible movement I've seen from some players in there is just on a different level. (I guess because there is no SBMM in there)

People bunnyhop around and lightning speed and have this weird jittery movement that makes them very hard to hit. Though at the same time, they hit other easily while bouncing around like that. They are also in the air half the time and the results are the same there: hard to hit, they hit every shot. 

They also switch weapons back and forth like they are playing Doom Eternal, constantly rotating between two guns after each shot. I've never seen anything like it. 

I guess these are PC players? I consider myself pretty decent on console with a controller, but those movements seem impossible to perform for me.

"So, the new player experience...","Hello everyone. I started playing Apex Legends on PC a few weeks ago so I could party up with my buddy, but things have been rough so far. My aim is terrible and my movement in gunfights is probably equally terrible and I'm struggling to improve. For context, I used to play Planetside 2 a few years ago and I racked up killstreaks in that game like a demon, but none of that experience seems to translate here. I can barely manage a single kill in a match and it's extremely disheartening.

My account is currently sitting at level 6. The last few matches left me feeling guilty about dragging my team down due to my inexperience, which made me not want to queue up again. I heard that dropping near enemy teams can force you to get better at aiming but I haven't tried that yet.

tl;Dr New player. I'd like to get better at the game, but my last couple of matches have been almost as unfun and frustrating as my first games in Dota2 like 10 years ago. Any advice is appreciated.",apexlegends,1705581592.0,t3_199p98x

"So like, is there something I can make an effort to do to try to get some actual experience in this game ?","I say that cuz like, I'm bad at firefights, but it kind of feels a little difficult to get better at them when they're over the moment they happen. 

This game feels like it has some really weird pacing that feels overall detrimental to anyone trying to get better vs people who are already better. 

Cuz either you start the match and spend like half an hour looting in peace to get really good gear so you feel ready for a fight, only for your entire squad to get wiped the moment you get into a fight despite your gear. 

Or you drop right into a hotspot with literally nothing and get slammed due to that. 

And I've found there's really no in-betweens. 

Like, I wouldn't say I'm bad at shooter games, cuz in any other I do perfectly fine. 

It just feels like the whole Battle Royale setup to this game makes the pacing between fights really awkward. 

And because the fight is just over the moment you die, you have to go through a whole match-making wait all over again to get into another fight which you'll likely die to and yeah this is just a whole thing. 

I've tried playing Bangalore, Caustic, Pathfinder, Ash, anyone I can think of that could possibly give me some sort of tool to help give me and my squad an advantage in fights, but it always feels like the enemy just knows exactly where we're at and any advantages I gain are just undermined because the enemy completely ignores them. 

Even Bloodhound doesn't help me because yeah I get information but it's very fleeting and I just die when the enemy approaches anyway. 

I don't really know what to do here. 

Should I try to find some random veteran to play with to babysit me or just play Mixtape or somethin ?

I literally JUST beat TSM's pro team 3 stack in Ranked to get to masters...im ecstatic right now...,"I literally CAN NOT fucking believe it bro...my friends aren't gonna believe it either 😂... 

So I had failed my masters trials like 50+ times already, to the point where I had 10 attempts to get it, and failed still so I had to gain 50 rp to try again...so i did that, right?... 

I hop on, and immediately invite my duo who were also on... 

Me and one bud were both doing our promos to masters, he had 9 attempts and I had 10...

After 9 CLOSE ASS games (every single one ended in top 5, and a few were top 3) my bro got mad and said fuck this it's 3am, I'm getting off...ok koo...so I have one more try...why not just solo queue right? I'm probably going to fail and try tomorrow, might as well just do it and start fresh the next day... 

So I queue up, find a game, and guess who the champions are? TSM ImperialHal, TSM EvanVerhulst, and some other TSM guy who's full name I didn't catch... 

I immediately said ""welp, so much for winning this one..."", and the wave of defeat started washing over me before the game even started...but I just went with it...

My teammates were good 😁 FINALLY! Me and the Bangalore I got were roughly the same skill level, but the horizon on our team was just fucking CRACKED! 

Long story short we just followed the horizon and supported him 😊 I played conduit and kept everyone in fighting shape, we killed a couple teams on the way to top 5, and in the final end zone we had an insane height advantage... 

The circle closed all the way, we hopped off the roof, and finished up the last 2 squads (who were already kinda weak) for the W 😃😃😃... 

Im so fucking hype that my phone died while writing this and I lost it all, but I literally HAD to share this so I typed it all again 😂... 

Lucky (the horizons name), if you somehow see this, please confirm this story in the comments because I know no one is going to believe this shit 😭 and thank you bro! You are the fucking goat! Already told you that like 10x, but just gotta say it again! 🤣 Your name is very fitting because I would've never imagined I would beat TSM to get to masters rank...WHILE SOLO QUEUING...im still just in shock...

Edit: Also played a few lottery tickets for obvious reasons...(not joking 😂)...

Edit 2: Really this post is just to say, if you're having trouble with promos, and you're really fucking close to the rank you want, don't give up on yourself! YOU CAN DO IT!

Lol like I said it took me 50+ tries until I got lucky, so if you already put in the time and you want to rank up in the hardest season, just bang your head against the wall doing promos over and over and I promise eventually you'll get it...

It's torture tbh...getting so many 2nd and 3rd place games just to fail the promos...but once you get it, it's a high that makes every second worth it...

I understand the matchmaking is hot garbage and all, but this doesnt seem like it would be so hard to solve(tho obviously im not a programmer, so take this sentence with a grain of salt).

"How Apex Legends could be, better.","There’s a lot on my mind about the game and where it’s going. FPS or shooter games generally. My friends were the ones who got me into this game as good friends would do. I’ve been paying attention to this game not only playing it, but always viewing YouTube content and watching the pros play in tourneys and scrims. I recently joined Reddit. I’m not the best player in the game but I have a certain game knowledge by always devouring the info I see, going from trios to ranked usually getting platinum then to diamond. The characters I play are anybody really. I like Blood, Path, Gibby, Valk the most. The meta has been changing on and off since the characters keep getting newer and others more useful in different game modes. I remember when ranked had no shields and we had to find a white shield ourselves. I know this game has been under fire about the money they try and make and the way they handle the cheaters like most competitive game have been. Please make sure that you guys give me some feedback on why or why not my options and opinions matter to you if interested.

1. Dropping with a P2020 or mozam. (Ranked and competitive) enhance the loot rng

2. Dropping with a grey backpack. (Ranked and competitive) easier to loot up

3. Rank point system should be a loss in full points only if you die 20th. Getting a kill or placing 19th and above should be less of a point loss. Not just when you get 14th or 10th. Ranking points from tenth and so on should result in better points but not as much as getting the win. 2nd and 3rd points shouldn’t be close to a win.

4. Take off the demotion tries and negative point loss. Why lose half of your points and have to get tries before you demote. Just take away the amount we lost and derank normally.

5. The nerfing of some characters like wraiths ability to phase is slow. Makes her less viable and not balanced. Her animation needs a fast pace like ult. Path is the only one to get a cooldown and ult when looking at a care package. Rev is played as a skirmisher but was assault before. All those things make the game feel more of a choose to win then a play what you like. Seer is played way less often. Certain characters like conduits shield heal doesn’t prioritize who is weak but closest and is slow to do so on herself. Ballistic can’t cancel his ability. Mirage’s clone only walks but if he could go on zips or do other things it would make characters more interesting. Path would be cool if he could heal on his zip. Just weird suggestions really to make gameplay more fun. All these things are difficult to implement so I know it can’t always be that way.

6. Heat shields are two stack, should be one/Doesn’t have speed revive. Not in comp scene..one is all you need. 

7. Updates and bugs are still in the game. Everyone should have a job that takes care of those things accordingly and if you can’t fix ‘em tell the community why or when.

8. You can only rank with friends who are close rank to you. If this is for boosting factors I guess it makes sense.

9. Bronze and below should be matched up in the same lobbies. Silver and gold. Platinum and diamond.

10. Masters and preds need more incentive or reward. They need their own tier list even or add an extra high rank to have a challenging experience.

11. Skydive trails aren’t saved only banner icons. Why is that?

12. Trials was okay but having 1000 points just to get to the next level is not rewarding. Point system is. The higher the rank, the more points should have to be earned. Season splits or no season splits. Make it to where we can like to play it forever without changes. Then change it if gets stale. At least in my opinion.

With all that being said, it’s not enough. And the devs or whoever prolly won’t read this. Or listen to the actual people. Keep copy pasting gun nerfs and stick to event scheduling but atleast they could hire some people to buckle down on the cheaters.",apexlegends,1705525723.0,t3_1997tcz

I am tired of the MRB in Control,"Thee has been a lot of times where, the match is not bad, but also not good, and then this items drops, and on that point onwards, both teams are focused on getting the Mobile respawn beacon, and there are two outcomes when that happens:

1- The enemy team gets it and places it down on your spawn (Zones A or C), but they cant do anything

2- The enemy team gets it and places it down on your spawn (Zones A or C), and they domminate your whole team

I really don't like the thing about the MRB (Mobile respawn beacon) being on Control, i have enough stress when the bonus appears, so i think they should remove it, at least for me i don't think it belongs in Control

(The photo is from a match, where they deployed the MRB on my spawn and they couldn't do anything)

Nostalgia is gatekeeping your enjoyment,"A lot of people complain about the game, but the most common thing I've seen everyone mention is that ""it used to be better"" or the ""back in my day this and that"".

I started playing again after a year long hiatus, since then SO MUCH has changed and for the BETTER. New maps, new modes, new legends, new QoL changes and my most favourite, CHANGING THE FIRING RANGE ITS SO GOOD NOW. This was a lot better than it was a year ago and im much more hyped to play again.

The game is in a really good spot for new players to come and enjoy and the people from like season 0 or the early days aren't complaining about the game being different but rather yall just miss the good times you had during that time. And thats whats stopping yall from enjoying it now. (We can all agree that old time apex was way more buggier than now)

So don't discourage the new players coming in because trust me, this is the best time to play with a lot of new content and even the event, i know its controversial, but they will be able experience a super cool ltm.

Another nerf I’m kind of salty about was removing Wraith’s Naruto run. Just like Lifeline’s shield they could have adjusted it but they removed it instead and now she only Naruto run in phase, when she’s immune to damage anyway.

I’m also kind of salty about Bangalore’s smoke being nerfed to stay for… 18 seconds instead of 23. Because it did nothing and she needs more nerfs. Why is she still able to deploy 2 smokes at a time? It’s actually so stupid.

Fan Creates Rework Ideas Pt. 2,"
Wraith - 
Wraith is one of the heaviest hitters in the Game's all-time meta but has a lack of use in the current meta outside of her insane repositioning ability. This insane repositioning gave Wraith a reputation before being nerfed to hell, so creating a new way to play Wraith would be ever so monumental to the game's state. Her new Ultimate would be grounded and give her a competitive edge, but a weakness. The ultimate I thought of is a dome of portals, she'll be thrown around a mess of portals, depending on the range of the dome (She can choose how far it reaches up to a limit,) would be her time to shot before her reentry. This would give a dicy, more thrilling edge without making Wraith a deciding powerhouse.
Ash -
Ash sucks, it's a definitive truth, despite this she can be worked on and by providing more creative, stealthy tactics rather then a weaker skirmisher with no utility will provide the 3 Ash mains some comfort.
Passive - 
Ash's passive is great, but isn't codependent on her kit in any way (isn't bad, just nonsensical,) so her passive should a jump boost to jump higher on walls. (This ties in with tact.)
Tactical -
Her old tactical sucks. So create a new one, ""Shroud,"" a device that sticks to walls and allows her to hide and spectate. 
Secondary Tactical - 
After Hiding in her shroud and viewing the enemies from the void, she will get a ""Phase Shuriken,"" that allows her on accurate throw to change places with the enemy for the remainder of the allotted time or until an enemy breaks it. 
Ultimate -

Turn kill cam and kill quip off,"DISCLAIMER: I wouldn’t want to take these features away from people who want them/enjoy them, but I cannot tell you how much I would like to be able to turn them off for ME.



Ok, so I am not good at this game, and I like to play just every now and then.

But beyond the crushing difficulty of matchmaking, I find kill quips and the new addition of the kill cam very frustrating and downright depressing.

Like I said, Im not good at this game, I die a lot.
Most times you die, you get the privilege of hearing a character tell you that you suck or that they are better than you. I ALREADY KNEW THAT.

It’s just like rubbing it in my face, and it makes me not want to play. 

Kill cam similarly, I know I suck and I know that I died, why rub it in my face?

I’m not going to git gud, Im not going to go enroll in Apex Academy so that I can get even more stressed out about this game, I just play FOR FUN.

And having people tell me I suck, and rubbing my nose in it because I get killed IS NOT FUN.

Pre-Made Matchmaking,"I am sure I am not the first to talk about this. But, 

  
**Why the hell can't we matchmake with predefined legend choices?**

Should Loba be nerfed so she can’t grab heals and maybe shields with her ult?,"I main Wraith and Loba - they’re my 2 most played legends. Recently though with three strikes and because everyone has a lack of heals in that mode, I’ve become kind of frustrated with how scrubby people can be with Loba. Just using ult to steal all the batteries and evo shields in the area…Of course, the Loba is just doing what they’re supposed to be doing and providing loot/support and committing tax fraud. 

I do think it maybe is like genuinely unfair in a way though for the teams that are fighting and stuff like this can encourage ratting in ranked. It’s not like Loba is the sole cause for ratting or anything. Wraith, Horizon, Conduit are all played a lot more than she is, in all game modes. But just throwing Loba ult out, finding a God spot and then yanking evo shields from people fighting is absolutely something people do.

Nerfing her so she can’t grab heals would still give her and her ult a lot of utility. Thoughts?",apexlegends,1705504949.0,t3_198z0i4

"Conduit, Rev, and Stat Boosts","People have been talking about Conduit and her place in the game, and I think the interesting thing about her addition is the fact she came right after Rev Reborn. Both her and this new Rev have something no other Legend in the game has; a direct, uninterative stat boost.

There are plenty of stat boosts in the game, but all of them put emphasis on the action of the user. A speed boost, a handling improvement, a reload speed boost, none of those put up a ""wall"" that the other party hits against because the player with the stat boost pressed a button.

With Rev Reborn, there's a lot more interactivity with hitbox sizes and resets, but the point stands. Losing to Rev Reborn or a Conduit team because they ""just had more stats"" because they pressed a button is incredibly frustrating and uninteractive, in a way no other Legend is. The issue isn't that she heals, Lifeline heals and Wattson heals, the issue is that she offers a direct stat improvement that the opposing team can't do anything about.

I think this is worrying for the direction of abilities. Straight stat upgrades on a button press that the opponent is forced to break against is not healthy for any competitive game, it's too direct an advantage.",apexlegends,1705494588.0,t3_198vgl1

"To be honest, I was thinking about aim assist."," This is one idea, but wouldn't hip-fire aim assist be necessary? I think hip-fire aiming is difficult until you get used to it, whether it's keyboard mouse play or controller play. Also, if you play CS, you've probably experienced this at least once, but sometimes you get sucked in by an enemy you've knocked down, and your bullets don't hit the enemy the way you want. The aim is stuck to an enemy that is not the one you were aiming for. When performing flick operations, the hip-fired aim assist slows down the operation and causes the aim to point closer to you than you intended.  Aim assist is enabled only when aiming. How about introducing a system that allows you to switch, such as disabling aim assist only when shooting from the hip? ",apexlegends,1705479711.0,t3_198rqxl

My Patch Notes,"Before we start I want to mention I am trying to take in the fact of many factors like Competitive, casual and how to code/implement it.I am trying to buff weaker characters and overall trying to level the field.

Fuze:50% gernade resistance(no ultimates or abilities) 
Gives him more synergy and helps survivability

Ash:Ability to snare up to 2 people in one snare.Ult -30 sec and travel faster in phase.
The ability to snare 2 people would be a nice cc and making the ult up to par with wraith.

Ballistic:Passive swap time like if it had a blue stock, Weapon strafe speed in ult are reduce to a min of an AR,ex:LMG and snipers will have the same strafe speed as an AR and pistols and smg strafe speed will be inchaged.
It can give more variety to the ballistic and improve the feeling of using the ult.
 
Path:Passive to heal on zip, come on its a little obvious

Octane:If using tactical while reviving, 15% faster 
This may be big change but it will give Octane more of a team feel and playmaking ability.

Valk:Ult -30 sec  nothing big 

Crypto:Can ""Hack"" empty containers for extra mats +10 per. 
Crypto is a characters that preps so giving him this ability is not far off.

Seer:NO

Vantage:Tactical-echo will make a sound q signifying people near by. When person is hit with ult they do a sonar pulse every 2 second in a 8 meter radius,the scan works like old bloodhound scan.
These changes will make Vantage feel more rewarding and fit in her class.

Lifeline:tactical works like Newcastle tactical but slower,Ult only drop purple armor(no more blue armor)
Simple but effective changes to her kit.

Mirage:when bamboozled, .5 sec light arcstar stun(resets every second) and 5% damage intake for bamboozled effective duration.
Mirage's bamboozles never felt rewarding or punishing, I went with 5% damage intake over flat damage bc it would be annoying and not rewarding in higher level play.

Conduit:Tactical-space out the regeneration by 2 second
It's both a buff and nerf, you have it longer but less potent.

Loba:Passive-pinging shows items location ex:teammate pings ""I need sheilds"" it shows the shields with her passive. 1 pingable per person 
It could be hard to code in but This could be the push loba needs.

Caustic:tactical-deploy has 50 hp instead of 1 hp
Small buff to help him compete with the other controllers

Rampart: Tactical be able to through walls like caustic trap (can toggle off and on),Ult works like Vantage in 4 waves 
Rampart can be more active with these changes and be a aggressive as well.

Catalysts:Barricades without doors can be destroyed, have 200 hp 
This will tone back how annoying it is to fight against a catalysts.

If there anything you think should be changed Or can be added on, please let me know.",apexlegends,1705478079.0,t3_198rd6r

There needs to be a major rework for the control legends on Mixtape.,"Why is is it that these traps can stay up for the full length duration of a match where half of a team can easliy camp and be annoying. I don't have any legends that can counter them, it makes no sense. Make it so that their tacticals do not replinish on respawn, and have the traps sit on a timer. Its not tactical or strategic gameplay, its easy bs. Has anyone else seen how bad this is.

Maybe a few maps should be redesigned too IDK. Possibly limit how much a team can have (might not make sense) or add an ordinance to the game like a arc grenade from tf2 that disables them or can actually stun enemies.

No more of those fun late game situations because of… evac towers?,"I played about 5 games of ranked tonight, and maybe 5-10 the previous few days as a Diamond II. Probably 80% of the games had 15+ squads alive by the start of ring 3. 


Inevitably, this means that by the next ring I’m stuck with my solo q team hiding behind poor cover until another team can 30-30 us down. Sometimes we’re the team doing it, but regardless that’s not as fun. 


The fun part is beating a team 1 on 1, and that rarely seems to happen anymore. Either we swoop up an easy sweep or right when we’re winning another team starts taking pot shots. 


I wonder if the cause is because of evac towers. There’s no doubt it’s the most common survival item on the floor for some reason. Without evac towers, teams were forced to hold their ground in early ring 1 or 2 and rotators like path or valk or wraith were valuable for escaping. But now with evac towers everyone escapes every engagement, so then by ring 3 there’s 45 people alive. And now the support class is the most valuable class because if you don’t have an evac tower then you can craft",apexlegends,1705470324.0,t3_198pa0j

The recent brain-dead nerfs to weapons are a cancer that rigidifies the game. This must be rectified immediately.,"I am frustrated with the recent adjustments to SMG weapons, and it seems like the person responsible for these changes may not understand the concept of balance. The excessive weakening of R-99 and CAR is widely acknowledged, and I'd like to delve into the discussion using the SMG category as an example.

&#x200B;

In the same category, a strong contender is the Volt. The Volt's concept revolves around lower firepower and DPS but minimal recoil, providing versatility for mid-range coverage. In contrast, R-99 and CAR are specialized SMGs with high firepower compensated by challenging recoil.

&#x200B;

However, what is the current situation? Specialized SMGs cannot even compete with the Volt in terms of firepower, leading to a lack of incentive to choose them voluntarily. In other words, despite having multiple weapons, the practical choice is limited to using the Volt. The previously effective dynamic between specialized SMGs and versatile SMGs is disrupted. In some cases, adopting both types could have offered configurations excelling at close range while remaining effective at mid-range.

&#x200B;

But now, if one wishes to capitalize on both aspects, the only viable option is dual-wielding Volts. What is the appeal of such a scenario? Despite the existence of various weapon types in the SMG category, developers have stripped users of the opportunity to actively choose weapons, strategize, and have enforced a meta-game that aligns with their preferences, robbing users of the intended gaming experience.

&#x200B;

This trend is not limited to SMGs; it extends to the AR category as well. While introducing powerful new weapons adds freshness and excitement, the inexplicable decision to weaken the already well-balanced and stable R-301 upon introducing the Nemesis is baffling. There was absolutely no need to weaken the R-301 with the introduction of the Nemesis. I strongly advocate for an immediate return of the R-301 to its previous state.

&#x200B;

The intention to shift the meta is evident, but the forceful manner in which it is done often eliminates too many choices. Please consider carefully: what constitutes good balance in a game? In my opinion, it refers to a state where there is a balanced power dynamic among various elements within a certain range. Users should be able to strategically choose what they need from a variety of options, creating an ideal form. While making everything exactly the same is difficult, if strengths are concentrated within a certain range, a metagame develops, and users' tactics begin to shape the meta. This is the natural evolution the meta should take.

&#x200B;

I urge you to seriously reconsider this. I've expressed a lot, but recently, there seems to be a trend of making brain-dead nerfs to the meta, which feels quite absurd. Developers, please understand the game better and make adjustments that require thoughtful consideration. It appears there is a struggle with adjusting SMGs and shotguns recently, but I believe the key to resolving this lies in engagement distance. I hope for a balance adjustment that involves maneuvering in close and extremely close quarters.

&#x200B;

The recent updates continue to weaken the current meta weapons, frustrating me with the limited choices. While many express a desire for a 30-30 nerf in this thread, I believe it's essential to look at the root cause. The attempts to forcefully shift the meta with nerfs to G7, R-301, Nemesis, and Hemlok led to the prominence of the 30-30, which wasn't initially a highly-used weapon. As options were relentlessly reduced, more people are using it simply because there's nothing else. Continuing this adjustment path might lead to an increase in Triple Takes or Nemesis, resulting in more nerfs. What's the point of such a cycle? The current situation is the outcome of mindlessly nerfing weapons that had proven themselves as viable alternatives without balancing against others. It feels incredibly absurd.

&#x200B;

I hope for a more thoughtful and comprehensive adjustment in Season 20, rather than resorting to brain-dead nerfs.",apexlegends,1705449263.0,t3_198i1iq

Advice on solo queuing promo trials needed.,"Currently in the Gold to Plat promo trials. I must have easily attempted them over 100 times. Had multiple second place finishes, multiple games with 6 kills/assists and top 5 (never in the same attempt though). I tell all my teammates I’m in promo trials, doesn’t seem to help. I would be well into plat if it weren’t for the trials. Not a rat by any means, but finish in the top 10 more often than not. I tried LFG groups to no avail. Any advice would be appreciated, you can save the quit the game comments for yourself. I play conduit mostly, or bangalore/fuse if she’s taken. Thanks.",apexlegends,1705442051.0,t3_198f4rq
Discord q teams,"I have seen discor communities team up in games before, particularly warzone but I have been noticing apex is having the same issue. 3 games straight, several teams targeting specific teams and then not engaging each other. 

I noticed this pattern a few days ago but today, I even bothered to spectate and in my face, I watch several teams rotate in a way to pinch the ""outsider"" and then they take turns looting and even while being in each others sights, they dont shoot each other. 

Several of those people I spectate rocking master and predator badges and its hilarious. Its hilarious I win most my 1s vs a pred or masters and cant get out of plat. And its hilarious Im watching some insane teaming.

Sure, it can happen randomly but the fact for 3 games straight I spectated people running together and wprking together in ranked. At this point, I strongly believe that more than half of the high ranked players are cheating, teaming and what not.

"Annoying Things In Apex, That Shouldn’t Be Annoying?","What are some things in the game that people do that most wouldn’t consider annoying that you can’t stand? I’ll start:

1. When my teammates have white shields, I ping a better shield and no one dibs it or picks it up.

2. When I play with randoms and it’s clear they know each other (from their group name) and I am the odd person out. I am sure they are on Discord and I can’t hear what they are saying but they don’t use in game pings to communicate with me.

3. When people relinquish jumpmaster and then make suggestions for where to land.

4. Related to number 1, when you ping an item for a teammate they pick it up and not say thanks.

5. When people don’t speak the entire game and then they turn on their mic at the end of the game to complain. Like why weren’t you communicating the WHOLE time?

I need help.,"Posting this from an alt account, for privacy reasons. I don't like to share anything like this, but at this point I need to ask for help. I've been playing this game for a while now, more specifically around 1500 hours of active playing. I got to somewhat of an average level pretty quickly, but any further improvement seems impossible. I don't need coaching or vod review, more like of a mental advice. I know how to play the game, yet I'm making the same mistakes over and over again. But more importantly, my mental state while playing a game is terrible. I'm becoming more and more frustrated, tilted, anxious, because of my neverending failure, and I'm playing worse and worse. At this point I believe that I just naturally suck balls at this game, and there's nothing I can do about it. Even when I take a break, It's all over again and again. I get on, play ok for a while, then I became terrible, rage quit because of it.
If any of you have ever experienced this, please tell me what to do cause I'm out of options, I feel like giving up entirely, maybe it's just not a game for me.

Idea(s) for S20.,"Here are a few things I think if Apex did in Season 20, that would retain and bring more/back players.

1- Legend Tokens. 

Lets make a use for these, any item in the store that is Epic or lower should be able to be bought with Legend Tokens, and Legendary should be crafting materials or apex coins.


2- Ranked ELO system.

Trials are by far the worst thing ever, especially for solo players. MMR is also awful because nobody (i think including respawn) knows how it works. Just make it a straight up Elo system with a leaderboard.


3- Star system.

Solo-queuing is terrible. Introduce a star system, so you know how others rate their teammates, and to combatant ""fake"" ratings, you can see how often the person who rated them rates other people.

EX- you can click on someone's star rating, and see their last 5-10, and click on the person who gave them that rating to see if they are just trolls or someone who actually rates.

Definitely my least favorite LTM.,"For reference, I have been playing apex since the second day it came out; I have played every mode that has come out - from the winter express (my favorite), scopes & scatter guns, Halloween mode, etc. My first problem with this mode, you cannot turn it off. I should absolutely have the option to play regular trios to avoid the shenanigans.
 On top of that, this mode is here for 3 weeks - way too long for it to be the only trios option (other than ranked, which has a broken point system imo.) 
Reason 3, the swords. A game with some of the best gunplay around has now subjected itself to a cheesy gimmick of a two-hit-wonder-weapon. I can wander into the open, block your bullets, then charge at you in half a second, launching you into the air and cracking your shield in one swipe. Bullets do not slow the swordsman either.
Reason 4, while I do enjoy some aspects of the materia upgrades, they are way too apparent in the game, and the nessies are an absolute pest. Easy to kill, but they inevitably respawn, and become nothing but aim bots - further ruining the integrity of the game.

I just had a game with 10 kills, but OH SORRY you didn't get Top5,  your squad died #6,  so doesn't count for the Promo Trial from Gold to Plat!

My suggestion is to make it like ALGS,  sort of. Once you enter Trials, every one of your Trial games is being counted. Points for Placement, Points for Kills etc.  You'll always do 3 Trial games and at the end of it, points from all 3 games are added up and you need to beat a certain threshhold to succeed the promo.

BUT after failing several times we should just be awarded the next rank up. We earn more LP than is necessary to rank up before trials were added. I dont see the point in having gained 100+ LP just to stay in the same rank.

This game has to stop getting in the way of itself,"I hope this isn't too repetitive of a post but I just want to join the rest of you guys in solidarity. 

Thought I'd enjoy a day off playing some Apex. After a few hours it was enough to observe why it wasn't enjoyable. The game simply gets in the way of itself. I don't think the game is stale, it just needs QOL improvements big time.

I warmed up with Mixtape for a bit...

1. I get legitimately unplayable stuttering on the Caustic treatment map only. So if that's in the rotation, have to find something else...
2. Wait for TDM, get a match where three of our six players finished with zero kills and 200-400 damage while the other team is full of 4k 20 bomb players averaging 2500 damage each.
3. Oh and Audio randomly gets completely muted and muffled now since the latest patch

Okay time to move on to Battle Royale, oh right, its a forced LTM. Get my 2 games worth of rewards points, dying to a sword in a few hits each time. Nice...  


Alright time to hit up my ONE friend that still plays this game and try and chill on ranked because no Trios...

I kid you not, three games in a row our random decided to afk rat in some corner the whole time because well, ratting is rewarded more than kills...

I love this game when everything goes right but as of late, there's no way to enjoy a longer session without being met with the same QOL issues time and time again.

Why can't snipers 1 shot to the head? I ask this because I came from games like BF or hyperscape (won't say cod since yeah no reason to aim for the head) now I'm not sure if it's because of the shields that prevent players to get the kill besides the red version of the sniper but I'm curious why the game won't allow such thing to happen?

Issues when playing in a party with my friend,"Hi all. Recently, I've started playing Apex on PC (I played it before on PS4 and switched to PC when cross-progression became available). I have this one friend I usually play with, and back when I played on PS4, we played with each other  without major issues. However, ever since I switched to PC, playing with him became almost impossible. Whenever I play in a party with him, I'd get kicked out of matches like 70-80% of the time (as in, I'd get kicked out either on the legend selection screen or right after that) and I can almost never rejoin the match. But when I play alone, I never encounter this issue and all my matches start properly with no notable issues. My friend is on PS4, if that helps

So, does anyone know how to fix this? And thanks in advance",apexlegends,1705349714.0,t3_197imee

The Buster Sword is NOT the problem in this LTM.,"The **fucking nessies**! holy crap. Fast, spastic, little aim bot shits.

Who thought it was ok to make clairvoyant enemy alert systems, that hunt down anyone within your half of the map and are able to climb literally anywhere. It is absolutely impossible to outplay them so you *have to* waste your ammo on them.

Not that it does any good. They'll just be back in 5 seconds.

If the enemy team has two of them, they deal serious damage. Forget about using a shield cell. There's a fucking nessie after you.

And who decided that they would attack downed players?! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? *Oh you want to find cover? Haha, sucks for you! I have a  thirst machine!*

At least the swords have to be actively used while putting yourself at risk. And good players can absolutely defend against them.
