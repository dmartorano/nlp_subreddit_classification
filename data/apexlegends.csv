Low FPS during the ship drop with decent PC,"So I just bought a new pc, and I noticed that during the ship drop when you look at the entire map below you, the fps drops drastically, from an average of 150 fps during normal gameplay, to a miserable 60 fps during the drop, like cmon, on a RTX 4070?

"Hot Drops have a major flaw, making some deals overpriced compared to previous bundles.","Looking at some of the deals its seems like respawn made a sweeping price point per item making some bundles more expensive before the discount and even some after the discount.

Each item is priced at what each item rarity is supposedly worth (An epic item is 1000, a legendary is 1800, etc.) So a 2 item legendary bundle would orginally cost 3600 coins even if in previous bundles with the same items it was worth somewhere closer to 2250. Some of these discounts make the bundles still more expensive than the orginal bundle price, mostly with the epic rarity bundles and a few of the legendary ones. 

Definitely seems like a major oversight and could absolutely be considered scummy by abusing fomo mechanics if this is the intended pricing scheme.",apexlegends,1706037912.0,t3_19dwkbc

A Love Letter to the Ranked Random,"Dear stinky poots (not actual username, but a fun play on it),

It was *interesting* to watch you push a fight all on your own against a full team an entire POI away from where we landed, having only grabbed a single weapon and some ammo off of drop. It was exciting to work with our third to get your banner and res you! It’s too bad our third died for the sake of rezzing you too, but we eventually got him back 😊

I was surprised to see (jk, it didn’t surprise me one bit) that you decided to push yet another fight on your own - and into zone, no less! - with naught but your now two weapons and white shield. Later we would learn, after somehow being able to revive you, that you had no meds to make it through to the next zone!

All of this was done with absolutely no communication, not even a single ping!, on your part. It was only when you finally did die to zone that you decided to call us brain dead losers. I’ve gotta admit, that one hurt a bit (/s).

Apex Legends FPS Drops,"So here is basically my problem. If you know a possible fix, thank you in advance:

I have bought a new PC approximately 6 months ago. Apex was one of the first games I downloaded and played ever since.

Up until 1 month ago there was no big problem I was playing with good fps and having month. However, within the last month, I have this problem:  
1- My fps is down by 10  
2- When I first open the game, I have severe stuttering/fps drops at a point it is impossible to play. After a while it seems it passed for a short time but then, it is unplayable again. During this ""drop"" phase I generally see various of red warning signs on the right side of the screen.

My system specs: HM Omen Gaming Laptop 16  
Processor: intel i7-13700HX  
RAM: 16 gb  
OS: Windows 11 Home 23H2  
SSD: 1TB (Half is empty)  
GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU (Integrated)  
Display: 240Hz with 1440p

In other games (Finals and CS2) there is no problem of this sort. So, I am lost. FYI, the fixes I tried so far:  
Changed the nvidia control panel settings to only use the Nvidia GPU and changed some 3D settings to increase the performance (I changed them back to default)  
Tried every different in game setting in Apex  
My drivers are updated  
I set background apps off  
I changed to directx12 Apex settings but it did not seem to solve the problem.  
I have deleted OmenGamingHub and LightStudio (some 3rd party apps of HP) because they were using so much of RAM.  
I have played with LogitechGHub closed because I saw somewhere that it lowers the performance however, it did not work for me.  
I deleted and downloaded the game.  
I verified the game files through steam (Before and after reinstalling the game)

If you know anything that I can try, please say so as I don't have any more ideas to try (or why this problem is happening). Thank you all.",apexlegends,1706003793.0,t3_19dkzfs

Stuttering/Freezing on brand new PC?,"I recently upgraded from a 1060 3GB to a brand \[new\]([https://imgur.com/aIfhwmT](https://imgur.com/aIfhwmT)) PC, however, my old PC never had issues running Apex.

Things I've tried that have *not* worked, from various forum posts/videos:

\- Uninstalled/Reinstalled the game

\- Verified integrity of game files

\- Set priority to High in launch options

\- Disabled ingame overlay from GeForce Experience

\- When that didn't work, uninstalled GeForce Experience entirely

\- Lowered Mouse Polling Rate from 1000 to 500

\- Lowered all graphical settings to absolute lowest

\- Disabled V-Sync Ingame, enabled in NVIDIA Control Panel

\- G-Sync is enabled

\- Used DirectX12 launch options, no change in performance

\- Checked ""Disable fullscreen optimizations"" under Properties --> Compatibility in the gamefile

Crypto buff pls,"Hello! I have an idea to make Crypto a stronger pick for the 14 of us that main him.
Nothing crazy just a little something.

A new addition where once hack is deployed, player can hold their ability button(or something like that) to toggle 'modes' on hack.

Now, you've got the basic 'send it to hit a wall and it faces outward,' basically a sentry, so this would be 'sentry mode.' Where it's basically that, hack sits somewhere and scans outward.

Next is 'hover mode,' which makes hack fly above crypto, making it easier to be shot, but scanning any enemies within 15 or so metres, of course this would be limited by buildings, which is why it's only useful for specific scenarios. (If that's too good, maybe make a limit on how long it stays in the mode before returning to sentry mode)

Finally, is 'patrol mode.' This would do something along the lines of making hack move side to side within a set distance, say 50 metres, just slowly patrolling back and forth, or something like that.

I'm not much of a creative mind but I definitely think something like this would help crypto a good bit.",apexlegends,1705975662.0,t3_19dd9m3

Make it so the game also factors in how much shields Evo/Body Shields have as well as their level. Or make it like it is with attachments, where if you have a better one equipped you have to use the Alternate Interact button to pick it up. 

Shields that are higher level and have more shields: Interact

Shields that are lower level and have more shields: Interact

Shields that are higher level but have less shields: Alternate Interact

This guy spend the entire time chasing a loba that I ended up killing, as soon as that happenes we get another team attacking us...we survive but the pred is down, we rez him and another team comes out of nowhere...the pred guy is downed again and we wipe...as soon as we wipe the guy starts throwing all sorts of insults our way, we only stayed long enough to see the team summary screen showing that pred trail did the least out of the 3 of us and even then the insults didn't stop.

"Apex Legends super stuttery/laggy, no clue what the problem is","I can't seem to figure out this laggy/stuttering situation on my new 2023 ASUS Zephyrus M16.

It's running:

\-Intel i9 13th gen -RTX 4080 -48GB RAM DDR5 -1TB SSD -Using KTC H27S17 165hz gaming monitor

All settings are maxed out. Even if I lower the settings the stutter continues. All drivers updated (windows, Nvidia, Intel integrated, any peripheral apps, etc). I've tried deleting the graphics setting profiles etc (C:\\Users\\zeta0\\Saved Games\\Respawn\\Apex\\local). I've tried limiting the amount of apps running on theGPU and setting the rest to the integrated GPU. It happens when settings are either Silent, Performance and Turbo mode.

This isn't really happening on other games I've test (The Finals, Witcher 3, Counterstrike 2, etc).

CPU and GPU temps are normal during gameplay. CPU around 80c, and GPU 68c. Doesn't appear to be bottlenecking/throttling. FPS is consistantly 100-120.

Caustic Discussion,"How does everyone feel about caustic as of late? I am a long time caustic main but I do understand the reasoning behind his previous nerfs.

There is one thing I never understood, a long time ago, caustic and Bangalore were affected by a density bug that made their gas/smoke much easier to see through. Bangalore's smokes were fixed, but caustic gas was not, as the devs liked the gas being thinner.

Having thicker gas would be a really nice buff right now, for what I would argue is the weakest controller legend. I do think he's just one small push away from being in a good spot personally, but I'd love to hear what non-caustic players think of him right now.",apexlegends,1705927608.0,t3_19cuv4t

Killcam. I don't understand why I am bad," I will begin by sharing my experience before delving into the discussion about the killcam at the end of this post. I consider myself an average FPS player – not a pro, but certainly not a novice. With over 700 hours invested in Apex and an equal amount in Overwatch, where I achieved a platinum rank, I've also played extensively in other FPS games like PUBG and COD. Equipped with mid/high-tier hardware, I use a mouse and keyboard setup with a consistently strong internet connection. Apex has always stood out to me due to its mechanics, and I've been playing it since Season 1.

However, my relationship with Apex has taken an unexpected turn. In my earlier days, I would acknowledge my mistakes, aiming to improve my gameplay – a process often driven by unfamiliarity with weapons, game situations, and a need for enhanced aiming skills. The introduction of crossplay, though, brought about a new layer of frustration during matches. There were instances where I would shoot at an unsuspecting or distracted target from behind, landing nearly every shot, only for them to swiftly turn around and eliminate me within seconds.

Not every encounter resulted in frustration; there were times when I knowingly engaged in melee combat, accepting the imminent defeat. However, it's in those instances where I anticipate having an advantage that I am left bewildered as the outcome swiftly turns into a defeat.  In contrast, games like Overwatch rarely presented such challenges – when I sensed an advantage, I seldom lost a fight. So to better understand these perplexing situations in Apex, I started spectating the players who killed me. Strangely, I often found their aim to be inferior to mine. 

Recently, with the introduction of **killcams**, I hoped to gain insight into what went wrong. Unfortunately, watching these killcams only intensified my confusion. The reliability of these killcams remains uncertain, as I frequently encounter replays where my assailant misses more shots than I do, or situations where their aim falters at the beginning, the suddenly get better and execute a series of perfect shots with peculiar and unlinear movements.

In conclusion, despite my extensive gameplay hours, a clear understanding of my skills, and the ability to distinguish between novices and pro players, I consistently find myself in situations where I struggle to comprehend why I was outmatched, especially now with the added perspective from killcams. I'm curious if others in the community share this sense of bewilderment during their gameplay.",apexlegends,1705924038.0,t3_19ctu2v

My experience with players on Apex,"The two experiences I had with players on VC were direct opposites. First seemed to be a kid and honestly was super cool and nice, I didn’t talk to him but he was helping out the third person in our trio and was encouraging them on, was just a nice experience esp for a noob like me. This was one of my first games and I’m a people-pleaser so I was super stressed about messing up, but it was super chill. We actually made it pretty far too. 

So after that I left my mic on… well, until I met the second person with a mic-

The second was this dude who asked if we had mics and I said yes- and then immediately started complaining and trash talking. It was almost funny. We literally landed and I moved away slightly to grab some loot and he immediately started swearing up and down about how stupid I was and how he “always gets people who don’t wanna do teamwork” (ironic considering he wasn’t being a very nice team member) like whatever happened to “hello”. Then we got ambushed and died and ofc he starts trying to antagonize me, telling me it was my fault and taking down to me. Like “oh so how did your little solo adventure go for you” like if you don’t stfu boy I was two feet away from you. Bro literally thought he was some sort of military commander, like you’re playing fake war games in ur moms basement it’s not that deep honestly. I said one word and suddenly it’s beat Bobby flay level of cooking (except bro did not cook bro left the stove off and beat everyone else with a pan)

So I just left cuz I ain’t putting up with that sh*t. No more mic for me. Can’t say I’m really surprised though. But tbh I’ve come across way less toxic/annoying people than on most other games. 

All in all, most people seem to be pretty good at teamwork and that makes me glad, because I think it’s just a lot more fun playing with a team than on your own. Only really had one dude who just completely abandoned our squad and left us for dead. 
It’s good when there’s at least one player who knows what they are doing (not me) so I can just follow them around. 

I still dread being the jump master, though. It sucks. I always relinquish it but twice it ended up coming back to me. I never have any idea where to land and then the other people start suggesting places and I’m like… bro why didn’t you just make us land there in the first place. 

I think the team mechanics are implemented quite nicely and you really don’t need a mic or anything to communicate effectively. Which I think most games lack. It just makes it so much easier to have a good time. I feel like most game’s basically force you to use a mic or else everyone in the team hates you. Also, I like the little “thanks” option- makes me feel like a pure hearted soul.

Probably will never happen at this point but wanted to share my take on Kuben Blisk coming to apex as a legend.,"Blisk: The Original Predator

Passive: Apex Agression - as Blisk deals damage he builds up agression (as seen above your weapon hud). The more agression he has the faster he moves. Decays overtime

Tactical: Jump kit dash - briefly activate your pilot jump kit to dash in the direction you are moving. If you slide at the end you can keep your momentum. This ability has three charges that has a short delay between each one.

Ultimate: Survival of the Best - target a low health enemy in close range and dash towards them, knocking them prone and attempt to execute them, instantly killing them and bypassing the downed state. If an enemy damages you in this state the execution will be canceled but the target will be left in the downed state.

""Its simple. You kill me? You're better. I kill you? I'm better."" - Champion intro line and possible select line.

""I guess we know who's better."" - Kill line

""Oi, don't feel to bad. Not every day a legend faces a myth."" - Kill line",apexlegends,1705900808.0,t3_19co5r6
How to 'See' better in Apex,"I have a friend who plays, and I watch him share his screen relatively often when I am eating. Among the things he needs to learn to get better, one of the biggest things just seems to be that he doesn't see enemies very well. If an enemy is anywhere at all on my screen, I have a 99.999% chance of seeing them, sort of like how you expect eyes to work. But my friend seems to only be able to notice about 75% of enemies on his screen. If they are not 100% super mega easy and obvious to see, there's a decent chance he misses them completely, and then will turn his back to look at something else and then die to being shot in the back. I know this post will mainly get troll replies or no replies, but if there is any advice anyone has about what to tell him or how to train your eyes to see enemies better, I would love to hear them. He has gotten better at many aspects of the game, but I am at a loss as to how to teach him to notice enemies better. And until he does, he will always be stuck with the phrase ""WHERE DID HE COME FROM?!?"" on his lips.",apexlegends,1705897128.0,t3_19cn13l

Apex Legends Character Concept: Fracture,"Name: Fracture. 
Role: Assault.  
  
PASSIVE: Last Chance: When you’re downed, you can use your custom semi-auto pistol to damage enemies. Any kill or down will automatically revive you with 30 hp.   
  
TACTICAL: Rewind: Place a Teleportation pad that you can teleport back to at any time. Max distance of 40 meters. (25 second cooldown).
  
ULTIMATE: Pain Cycle: After a 6 second charge, you will deal 85 damage to all enemies within a 35 meter radius, at the cost of downing yourself. Any downs or kills made with the ultimate will not trigger the passive. If you don’t damage anyone with the ultimate, you won’t be downed. (2:15 minute cooldown).  
  
ADDITIONAL INFO:  
   
PASSIVE: -The pistol you use has similar stats to a P2020. 
  
-you can switch between using your knockdown shield and your pistol. You can’t.  use both at the same time.    
  
-click your tactical button while downed to switch between the knockdown shield and the pistol.  
  
-to prevent the passive being used recklessly, the enemy who downed you will be immune to the pistol for 3 seconds.   
  
TACTICAL: -You click your tactical button to place the Teleportation pad. You click it again while the pad is placed to teleport to the pads location.  
  
- The tactical is similar to vantages tactical. If your tactical is off cooldown and is in range, it will be colored blue. If it’s on cooldown, it’ll be orange. If it’s out of range, it will be red.  
  
- you can recall the pad at any time.  
  
ULTIMATE: -If you miss your ultimate, and no enemies are damaged, you won’t be downed, and 25 percent of your ultimate will be refunded.  
  
- during the 6 second charge time, enemies will be notified that they are in the ultimates range.  
  
-Your teammates will be slowed down by the ultimate, instead of damaged.",apexlegends,1705889377.0,t3_19ckjjc

Decrease from 3 to 2 activ traps. Oooook not the biggest fan of that 

Throwing range decreas. Just no. Not good.

And now they want to impliment line of sight to the traps? In my eyes thats with the throwing nerf the worst neft they coud have done. The thing that makes the traps so good is that they are not only traps but also indicators when enemies are close, now we have to see how thats working out.

Stutters and Lag,Hey everyone. I used to play apex back like 2 years ago and I just came back this year on pc and I never dropped under the 144 frame cap. My specs are (I3 12100f and an RX6650XT). According to the benchmarks with these specs are supposed to give me around 170+ fps on average and that's what I used to get. One of my ram sticks became faulty tho and now I'm on 8gb of ram and now when I open the game the maximum frame rate I get is about 105 with a very janky frame time graph so as you can probably guess I have a shit ton of stuttering. I've seen people run 8gb comfortably and according to YouTube benchmarks I dont think my ram should be bottleneck me that much.

Why is Solo Q'ing in Apex so much better then Warzone?,"I hate to be the guy that brings up another BR game into this forum, but I thought it was noteworthy to discuss the complete night and day difference of random teammate quality between Apex and Call of Duty WZ.

I took a small Apex break and have playing the new WZ3 update for the past several weeks since release and it's just been an absolutely hair pulling experience as a lifelong solo Q'er. I've played around 25 hours in total and put in around 200 games and each and every squad fill experience has been nothing but 12 year old kids blasting their music over the mic, kids who have no mic at all, zero team work or cohesion whatsoever, and just general chaos.

Thanks to Conduit I am happy to return to Apex. Conduit is missing piece of a puzzle this game needed.,"I always found difficult to play Apex Legends because of the sweats and match making. No matter how much I practice in terms of work-life-hobby balance (NOT playing each day 18 hours), I mostly end up being dead in 1-2 minutes of gameplay or being loot goblin for 10 minutes and then dying instantly making someone happy with all the loot I had.

Instead of improving aim and movement (requires a lot of time that I can't afford to waste because of job, family, hobbies) I always wanted to be a better support player. Active healer, or active teleporter to safety or something.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, many support legends still required offensive gameplay. Lifeline? Yeah you can heal... If your teammate and you survived the sweats. Revive? Try to defend lol. Loba? Well... What's the point in looting if you die after that quickly.

&#x200B;

But with Conduit... I like this one! I actually can HELP during a fight. I can heal shields quickly and give needed support. Even middle skilled player can have a chance against sweat with additional shields.

And oh boy, having those shields through the walls and with this distance... I think Conduit is a healthy addition to the game that was starting to die out for casual players because of the sweats (I play the game more than 3 years and I can say that 2-3 years ago I was not obliterated THAT quickly like nowadays).",apexlegends,1705853897.0,t3_19c6x0t

enjoy the game.,"so... this may be clutter or redundant, but i just wanted to say:
please try and enjoy the game; there is no need to get bogged down in the hate or constant accusations of cheaters. the game is good----movement is unmatched. dont think when you die, ""oh, he was cheating."" but instead think, ""oh, i shouldv've done x or y better.""

sure ea sucks and they can do better, but focusing on others is always the wrong way... because it is mostly out of your control. sure post glitches or additions you think would make the game better, but hate only brews more hate. 

Apex is the best BR out there and, again, the movement is unmatched. and if it does not grant you the fun or result you want then find other games....

i really do not know purpose of this post other than i am disappointed in gaming culture and communities in general and there is so much negativity in every gaming subreddit/community.

be the change you want; actualize the vision you percieve the gamestate should be.

anyways... goodluck and have fun.
much love.",apexlegends,1705824471.0,t3_19byj2y

I actually love team deathmatch and love this map, but I think it is bugged.  Every time this map is on rotation I get excited (or used to), but it doesn't ever actually connect.  I just sit while it makes the connect sound and says connecting, then goes back to matchmaking repeatedly.  It happens every time with this map, and happened on another team deathmatch map recently, and just cycles through failing to connect for the entire block.

The sword addresses aim assist and movement complaints,"Respawn trolled everyone hard with the sword. *monkey paw curls* What's that? Aim assist too good?

Things that I think would improve the game,"1. Matchmaking. This one is talked a lot about so I wouldn't elaborate too much.
2. Cosmetics unlockable by completing challenges. If all Respawn/EA cares about is engagement they could implement this system as it could give us players a further goal and a reason to actually keep playing the game. This could, if implemented effectively result in more people playing the game thus boosting the player count.
3. A new playlist which rotates between past LTMs. Due to an increased player count Respawn could implement a new playlist without affecting already existing playlists too much. This could give the people who want to play a specific LTM they missed out on an opportunity to experience it. In addition the playlist could be the place all future LTMs override removing the possibility of any complaints from a takeover event.

Buster sword should change your game strategy,"If you drop in a poi next to a poi with a buster sword, don’t venture off to that poi alone.  
Also be prepared to die in close combat. 
The sword is so op, it completely changes confrontations.   
Even though I prefer shooting people and detest the sword, I’m going for it on drop out of pure necessity. 
In doing so, I’m wiping the first enemy confrontation like 90% of the time.  Especially if the other squad has dropped in the same poi. 
If my team doesn’t get the “Thing”,  you have to take into account the melee reach is more than twice the distance of a punch and the lurch is way faster. 
Gotta really push your movement skills to put some space between you and the op sword.  This may sound like obvious advice, but remember that when they put up the sword shield, they take absolutely no damage. 
So fire a short burst to get them to put up the shield, then either use that moment to get some high ground or more distance or time their shield drop when firing. 
Other than Revs alt, there is no other time when it’s smart to do this, and Rev is actually taking damage.  Thus, the completely different game strategy for Apex.

Question from a returning player,"When apex first came out, i played it constantly. At the time I was on console & I was pretty good, winning a fair chunk of games, getting high kills etc

nearly 5 years on I've returned to the game but on PC with KB&M, thought I'd give ranked a try and got placed Rookie 4/0 LP, which is fine, I think I deserved that

I am solo q only and I'm wondering if these observations continue in the higher ranks or is this something I'll have to live with as a solo q'r

\- SO many octane & revenant players who want to hot drop, take every single fight even when ill prepared & when they die after trying to 1v3/1v6 they spam ping and blame you/the team

\- Playing as conduit, no one seems to take advantage of the shield boost

\- No one comms

\- Should I be playing conduit in solo q at this rank?

\- What other meta legends should I try to learn? (tried a tiny bit of Catalyst)

\- Assuming wingman x peacekeeper combo isn't meta anymore, I've been using mostly havoc & nemesis

\- does the LP you earn change based on rank, for example. Lets say I have a 5 kill win and I get 350LP in silver, when I get to diamond, will those same stats offer me less LP?

Any other advice for solo q climbing will be grateful!",apexlegends,1705750648.0,t3_19b9wys

low 99% FPS in game sometimes,"I recently got a new computer and in most games, it runs completely fine with high fps and 99% fps however in apex the fps is at 260 - 300 while the 99% fps is around 150 - 200 (still high but is really inconsistent which makes the game feel bad). it also frequently drops to like 20 or 30. If anyone has any fixes i'd really appreciate it.

(I've lowered my graphics as much as I can and it doesn't seem to do anything, I have also set a startup command which sets the fps max at 160 which makes it slightly better)

My Take On How To Better Apex,"Ranked: bring back how s13 worked during split 1but keep promotion matches. also please remove heat shields from ranked similar to algs  


LTMs: please instead of takeovers just make it a separate mode. when i want to play with my friends who are new i want to teach them apex not an LTM  


* Conduit: make the tactical heal using her shield health or make it so it can only heal 50 shields
* Bangalore: nothing. her most appealing factor imo is that smokes counteract aim assist 
* Bloodhound: Please have blood ult give constant scans like it used to if the scans are 1second full body.
* Horizon: Shorter tactical duration and/or weaker pull on ult. p.s please fix her audio
* Valkyrie: Make her a controller. just my take but she doesn't need care package scans where her ult is a evac tower
* Seer: Give back fast heartbeat scans and increase range to 60 meters at least. for tactical, the scans should be 5 seconds. for ult, let the throw range be 25-30 meters and give back diamond scans for moving enemies and add footprints for crouching enemies.
* Loba: MAKE HER TACTICAL CONSISTANT PLEASEEE
* Catalyst: make her ult blind/slow for less time  


ok that's all for now. please share your input as well :)

Leaving penalties in unraked (OCE),"The reason I specified OCE is because it is impossible to get a ranked game in OCE, I don't know why but people just don't play ranked. I'm having to go to Singapore severs every time I want to play ranked, and it becomes unenjoyable because my ping goes to 200. Which is where all the early leaving penalties are.

Everyone knows leaving early is bad in Apex but it is horrendous in OCE servers, I've had so many people that will leave while they're still alive because our other teammate has left or gone down (while I'm still alive as well). There isn't enough of a penalty for leaving early. I report all of them but because it's unranked I doubt it matters. There should at least be a 3 minute cool down timer, and it grows with each early leave the person does per day.

I've played maybe 10 games today, every single game has had someone leaving early.",apexlegends,1705726626.0,t3_19b3txp
Apex Legends Character Concept:,"Pls don’t be rude or hateful to me or anyone in the comments. I enjoy reading feedback as long as it’s appropriate and respectful. Ty :D!  
  
Name: Overdrive. 
Role: Skirmisher. 
  
PASSIVE: Hard-wired: Reload your weapons and move faster for 6 seconds after your shield is broken.  
  
TACTICAL: Dash: Move 15 meters very quickly in any direction. (20 second cooldown).  
  
ULTIMATE: Dash Tunnel: Create a 45 meter long Tunnel in any direction that anyone can use. You can open and close the tunnel’s entrance at any time. Lasts for 30 seconds.  
(90 second cooldown).  
  
ADDITIONAL INFO:  
  
PASSIVE: - The passive won’t activate again until the previous 6 second timer is over. Meaning if you get your shield cracked twice in 6 seconds, the time won’t restart.  
  
-The passive lets you reload your guns and move 20% faster.  
  
TACTICAL: - The dash will break any doors that are in its way.   
  
- The Dash has a 1.5 second charge time before it activates.  
  
- The dash is NOT like a wraith phase. You can still be damaged while dashing, however you’d be really hard to track.  
  
- It takes roughly 1.5 seconds to reach the full 15 meters.  
   
- Like wraiths “Into the void” ability, you can’t use weapons for a short period of time after exiting the dash.   
  
- The Tactical goes the direction your moving. For example, if you’re moving backward, the dash will take you fifteen meters backwards. If your not moving, or moving forward, you go forward. If your moving to the side, you’ll go to the side.  
  
-when moving forward, the tactical will go where you are looking. So if you’re looking up, you’ll go fifteen meters up. If you’re looking down, you’ll go fifteen meters down, etc.  
  
ULTIMATE: - The ultimate would be roughly as fast as an ash ult. However you can move back and forth.   
  
- Closing the tunnel entrance will kick anyone in it out instantly.   
  
- You can’t close the Tunnel when you are using it.  
  
- you get an audio cue when an enemy is using your Tunnel.  
  
- Like the Tactical, the Tunnel can go in any direction, depending on where you’re moving and looking.

What are some tricks you fall for when an enemy is playing your main?,"I'll start off with myself as an example. I'm a Rampart main, and I always like locking building downs and waiting for enemies to kick down doors. They never expect me to pull out Shiela and this always guarantee me 1-2 knocks per door. If they somehow made it inside (e.g., grenade spam before entry), I'd normally have 1 amped cover in the back of the room for me to fall back to and make my last stand.

Yet, I still fall for other Ramparts (normally ones that are low) who rush into a building, block the door, and Shiela me down. There are hardly any Rampart players in pubs (besides the current event) that I don't have the reflexes to not kick down doors when other Ramparts are behind it.

Ping System > Mic,"You dont need mics to communicate effectively.

Your call outs take longer to process than a visual indicator, and are prone to misguidance . I.e. statements like ""they are low"", ""one shot"", ""they are here"", ""they are there"". It only serves to confuse.

In high stress situations why would you want people talking over the already almost non existent footsteps? Or even worse talking AND pinging (often spam pinging). You cant hear or see anything as teammates spam ping multiple enemy locations. 

And if you are going to use your mic. Make sure people can hear you well. Dont get mad because none of us can hear your call outs over the game. And no matter of raising your voice in stressful situations actually makes anyone try harder or somehow aim better. 

I say this because my best games have come from quiet games. No one is speaking. Pings are precise and not spammed. And my team is using all the types of pings to communicate.

My worst games often come from being confused in high stress scenarios. People talking, people pinging, and still no idea where the enemy is. Maybe skill issue, but I feel I'm not alone.",apexlegends,1705703656.0,t3_19avuuq

How to fix Vantage,"Vantage is a ""suvivalist sniper"" in the recon class that is barely picked across all game modes, ranks, and skill levels. She also has a 0% pick rate at a pro level. Overall, I think her kit is great and she is fun to play, but it's clear she needs some kind of buff or change to make her more viable. 

I would keep both her passive and tactical the same. The passive fits the recon class and is quite underrated in providing useful information through the Spotter's Lens. I would also keep her tactical echo location the same as it fits the sniper roll allowing her to reposition during fights. It is also quite balanced because she is has an absolute chonker hit box and the ability is slow to use - not like the instant-getaway mobility that skirmisher like horizon brings. 

IMO, the real issue with Vantage is her ultimate, sniper's mark. For starters, she is a mobile recon agent, so why give her a damage-dealing ultimate? The damage is very lackluster unless you hit multiple shots which are capped at 6. It's also so weak when guns like the 3030 are in the game that do more damage, are faster, and have more than 6 bullets.  The damage bonus mechanic is lackluster and rarely capitalized off of. The sniper in its current state also teeters between being weak and insanely OP. If they increased the damage per bullet or increased the multiplier duration, it could result in a really OP sniper or a really oppressive mechanic. Overall, it's just a bad design and needs to be changed. 

My suggestion to fix her Ultimate would be to remove/reduce the damage portion of the sniper and make it primarily a recon ability. If you tag someone with the sniper, it highlights the enemy to your entire team - similar to maggie's ability Warlord's Ire that highlights enemies she damages. If hit by the dart, the player can remove it by holding interact over 1-5 seconds, similar to removing a Cypher dart in Valorant. This not only makes the ability more in line with her recon class and role, it makes her more team-oriented and creates an interesting and similar dynamic to that of choosing to heal vs. fight as it would force players to stop and remove the dart, or keep it on risking that you are fully highlighted. It also rewards skill and accuracy and isn't just a press-a-button free wall hack ability like Seer/BH. I would also suggest they increase the handling and hip fire of the sniper greatly. I picture a super fast auto-rifle recon dart gun instead of a slow single-bolt sniper. You should be able to quickly tag, swap, and capitalize.

What do you think?

TLDR: Vantage is bad. Change her sniper ultimate to a recon dart that highlights the enemy for the whole team. Dart can be removed by holding a button like Cypher from Valorant. Buff the sniper's handling, speed, and hipfire. Decrease the damage or remove it entirely. Make Vantage an actual recon sniper that provides utility to the team.",apexlegends,1705699863.0,t3_19aucpb

Is the content of Youtuber LewiTrotter legit?,"I am quite new to Apex and was looking for some content to see how people approach fights etc.

I have stumbled onto this youtube channel by a guy named LewiTrotter. He is a pred player, mostly doing challenges for his channel (win with every legend within 24h, 20 bomb with every gun etc.). In the beginning I was amazed how he racks up those kills and gets to these fights.

However, after seeing other people's content and my own fights, I have started to wonder whether LewiTrotter is getting legit players of his caliber or just really low ranked players. 

Why am I saying this:

* In some instances the opponents simply don't shoot him or push him when he is low
* He seems to be able to use his Horizon Q to heal up fully, often right above the opponent's heads. If I did that, they'd beam me back to Valorant.
* During his challenge using all the legends, he doesn't seem to use the legend's ability well or at all. Is his gun fighting ability that good that he could basically play CS in Apex with no issue?

I lack the game knowledge to tell whether his lobbies are legit - other people seem to notice that too judging by his YT comments.

Seer needs to be Reworked but not Reborn,"I know I'm going to be crucified for this as most people hate Seer and want to keep him 6 feet under but hey, I think it might be better to toss the idea out there. I personally think Seer needs to start with a clean slate but not reborn. I love his legend fantasy of being the person who sees all but I think he's super overloaded with what his abilities do and would heavily benefit from being a little simplified. Here's how I would personally change him and this is from someone who loves to play Seer and love his ability to give great information, but hate how they keep hitting him back and forth like this making him unplayable when solo queuing and just worse than BloodHound when with a squad, albeit very deserved as he was actively making the game worse when he was strong.

Goal: Make him a much more information based legend. Make his scan the primary focus and make his tactical not do 1000 things all at once as it's the reason why he just can't be balanced. Nerf his passive without making it completely useless and buff his ultimate into being somewhat less situational.

HeartSeeker: Make him have to genuinely dedicate to his passive. Keep the beat rate thing that tells you if someoneis low on health. Give it a secondary indicator that tells you if there are multiple people with low health(ie. Two out of sync heartbeats, cap of 3). his passive while he has a gun out. Keep the passive's current accuracy(maybe even lower it) but make its range match his tactical. Make it much quieter. Remove the indicator that shows how close an enemy is(varying levels of how orange his ring is). Bring back his ability to sprint while using it. 

Focus of Attention: Make his tactical faster as it is way too easy for anyone with even 1/4 of a braincell to dodge it. Keep the silence but lower its duration to 5 seconds. Give it a pulsing scan that acts as a ping (Scan would stay stationary because having constant information is busted) every 2.5 seconds(2 scans). Keep the threat vision with line of sight as it should be good at countering smoke. And of course, remove the slow function that it has as its just unnecessary and overkill, same with the revealing of health and shields.

Exhibit: Keep his ultimate basically the same but give it the same pulse scan that I gave the tactical at a lower frequently due to its long duration, maybe once every 5 seconds. I actually like where his ultimate is at although it is rather weak in most place on the maps and would like a clearer indication of where everyone is, especially when in a more open area. When people shoot, you tend to already know where they are so I think it just needs a little pick-me-up.

This is just what I came up with for how I'd like to see him changed in the future but what would you guys personally do with him because I like seeing what other people would do to fix such a poorly designed and handled legend.

And wouldn't you believe... I've started to dig Gun Run. Not just accept it, but DIG it.

See, there's something about being FORCED To use a specific setup that has a strange appeal to me now. It's like the game is saying, ""This is it, make the best out of it, and get a kill or be stuck with it forever.""

I tell ya guys, this mode aint that bad. It's about mindset, imo. Take the mode for what it is, the challenge is in handling the various guns properly, and it'll only make you a better player at the end of it.

Don't really care if they implement it or not, just something I thought about and wanted to know what others thought about it. Would it be too broken? Or would it make her more viable?",apexlegends,1705637742.0,t3_19aaaht

I need the community to settle this!,"On storm point, playing as a 3 man squad, im the jump master and we drop hot at Echo HQ. A round or two before this I dropped within the HQ where the majority of the loot is and where they just removed the zip to the roof while the other two guys in my squad landed at the bins just outside where their is loot along and between the steps. I had died because I wasn’t close enough to them so I said alright next time if you guys want to drop outside HQ I will too. So back to - I’m jumpmaster, I go for HQ but land at the bins just outside, one of my teammates breaks off so he’s landing at the bin on one side of the steps and I’m landing at the bin on the other side of steps. My third teammate rides me all the way down never breaking loose, lands on the same pile and bin, then we both proceed forward under the overhang and I grab something and he shrieks “”BRO YOU ARE RAKING MY LOOT MAN I RAN AWAY SO YOU COULD LOOT” mind you this is literally the next closest pile and pretty much the most logical path to loot down otherwise I’d have landed somewhere else. I told him it’s ridiculous to stay with jumpmaster all the way to the ground and land on same pile and run the same direction and call that your loot, I said you are literally taking whatever loot is on that path and reducing the amount available to both of us, if you want to call it your loot then break off of me and land close enough to get in the same fights but far enough that we aren’t grabbing at the same loot bins and piles.


I was told I’m blind, I’m crazy, I’m being greedy, I messed him up.

"KD 1.25, average damage 500. started Apex in S19 but can't promote from Bronze.","I got hooked on this game with Apexmobile and started Apex for PC from S19!
Unlike mobile, there are no bots in the ranks which I find very exciting and enjoyable.
When I first started, I was unfamiliar with PAD operation as it was my first time, but after practicing for a considerable amount of time every day, I am now able to actually perform the moves that I have in my head.

However, the rank system is very severe and it is very difficult to be promoted.
Of course, there are difficulties because I have been playing solo for a long time because I don't have anyone I know on the PC version, but I keep the VC on all the time. However, 90% of the people don't wear VC. But I still keep talking on VC lol.

Here is my question.
I have been stuck in the bronze zone for about a week now, but when I look at the orbits, sometimes there are players in master or diamond orbits.
I usually don't win those matches.

I don't enjoy gaining points while hiding, so I basically do kill moves for fishermen and priority moves to secure the inside of the ring.

I am sure that is the key to improving my play skills as well.

Do you have any advice for me?
I thought I could at least aim for platinum, but anyway, the PC version of Apex is too difficult...

How do you play Apex in 2024 without good aim?,"I used to play the game casually a few years ago, decided to get back into it because the gunplay seems fun but I’ve gone through well over 200 matches now and haven’t even gotten close to a win, the closest i’ve gotten was fourth squad alive.

Every other player is impossibly fast and I can’t even comprehend what I’m looking at, let alone aim and fire. The game just doesn’t really feel fun to play for me anymore if I stand no chance against players at even the “lowest” levels. After all, it doesn’t matter what my positioning is if I can’t land more than one shot before the enemy turns into a mosquito. My only luck so far is hitting someone with so much damage at once that they aren’t able to react themselves before I can shoot again and down them, but that’s only possible with a select few relatively rare guns.",apexlegends,1705591734.0,t3_199sp87
Hoping a dev can see this: massive crypto bug,"Unsure if this was posted already, but I feel like we should spread the word for these new crypto bugs which cost me the game.

1. Crypto drone can't open large doors anymore.Only regular doors. There's even the tooltip saying I can open the large doors, but spamming it nothing happens, which leads me to believe this is a real bug. I'm talking about the huge cargo doors like at command center on storm point, as well as the ones that slide up like at harvester on WE.

2. Crypto drone can't steal an already active respawn beacon. Arguably, this could have been an exploit they wanted to get rid of, but I really wish it was still in the game. I used to do this all the time and abuse the fact there's no loading bar for crypto when he is respawning his allies, but an enemy team was respawning their teammate at the respawn beacon, and I couldn't use the beacon. Extremely frustrating as it ended up being a 1v3 because I couldn't drop my teammates back in, and they got both their teammates back in.

3(not a big deal), but it seems like with certain crypto skins, his sword loads in like under him by 6 feet when dropping and the gun drags on the floor. I’m sure this is just where the image of the weapon is, cuz I can still headglitch, so I really think it’s just the coordinates the frames are assigned to, but the actual bullets and gun/gameplay are fine.",apexlegends,1705591528.0,t3_199smen

In mixtape you can truly see the immense skill difference between players. Is movement for PC players that much better?,"I've been playing more mixtape modes lately and the incredible movement I've seen from some players in there is just on a different level. (I guess because there is no SBMM in there)

People bunnyhop around and lightning speed and have this weird jittery movement that makes them very hard to hit. Though at the same time, they hit other easily while bouncing around like that. They are also in the air half the time and the results are the same there: hard to hit, they hit every shot. 

They also switch weapons back and forth like they are playing Doom Eternal, constantly rotating between two guns after each shot. I've never seen anything like it. 

I guess these are PC players? I consider myself pretty decent on console with a controller, but those movements seem impossible to perform for me.

"So, the new player experience...","Hello everyone. I started playing Apex Legends on PC a few weeks ago so I could party up with my buddy, but things have been rough so far. My aim is terrible and my movement in gunfights is probably equally terrible and I'm struggling to improve. For context, I used to play Planetside 2 a few years ago and I racked up killstreaks in that game like a demon, but none of that experience seems to translate here. I can barely manage a single kill in a match and it's extremely disheartening.

My account is currently sitting at level 6. The last few matches left me feeling guilty about dragging my team down due to my inexperience, which made me not want to queue up again. I heard that dropping near enemy teams can force you to get better at aiming but I haven't tried that yet.

tl;Dr New player. I'd like to get better at the game, but my last couple of matches have been almost as unfun and frustrating as my first games in Dota2 like 10 years ago. Any advice is appreciated.",apexlegends,1705581592.0,t3_199p98x

"So like, is there something I can make an effort to do to try to get some actual experience in this game ?","I say that cuz like, I'm bad at firefights, but it kind of feels a little difficult to get better at them when they're over the moment they happen. 

This game feels like it has some really weird pacing that feels overall detrimental to anyone trying to get better vs people who are already better. 

Cuz either you start the match and spend like half an hour looting in peace to get really good gear so you feel ready for a fight, only for your entire squad to get wiped the moment you get into a fight despite your gear. 

Or you drop right into a hotspot with literally nothing and get slammed due to that. 

And I've found there's really no in-betweens. 

Like, I wouldn't say I'm bad at shooter games, cuz in any other I do perfectly fine. 

It just feels like the whole Battle Royale setup to this game makes the pacing between fights really awkward. 

And because the fight is just over the moment you die, you have to go through a whole match-making wait all over again to get into another fight which you'll likely die to and yeah this is just a whole thing. 

I've tried playing Bangalore, Caustic, Pathfinder, Ash, anyone I can think of that could possibly give me some sort of tool to help give me and my squad an advantage in fights, but it always feels like the enemy just knows exactly where we're at and any advantages I gain are just undermined because the enemy completely ignores them. 

Even Bloodhound doesn't help me because yeah I get information but it's very fleeting and I just die when the enemy approaches anyway. 

I don't really know what to do here. 

Should I try to find some random veteran to play with to babysit me or just play Mixtape or somethin ?

I literally JUST beat TSM's pro team 3 stack in Ranked to get to masters...im ecstatic right now...,"I literally CAN NOT fucking believe it bro...my friends aren't gonna believe it either 😂... 

So I had failed my masters trials like 50+ times already, to the point where I had 10 attempts to get it, and failed still so I had to gain 50 rp to try again...so i did that, right?... 

I hop on, and immediately invite my duo who were also on... 

Me and one bud were both doing our promos to masters, he had 9 attempts and I had 10...

After 9 CLOSE ASS games (every single one ended in top 5, and a few were top 3) my bro got mad and said fuck this it's 3am, I'm getting off...ok koo...so I have one more try...why not just solo queue right? I'm probably going to fail and try tomorrow, might as well just do it and start fresh the next day... 

So I queue up, find a game, and guess who the champions are? TSM ImperialHal, TSM EvanVerhulst, and some other TSM guy who's full name I didn't catch... 

I immediately said ""welp, so much for winning this one..."", and the wave of defeat started washing over me before the game even started...but I just went with it...

My teammates were good 😁 FINALLY! Me and the Bangalore I got were roughly the same skill level, but the horizon on our team was just fucking CRACKED! 

Long story short we just followed the horizon and supported him 😊 I played conduit and kept everyone in fighting shape, we killed a couple teams on the way to top 5, and in the final end zone we had an insane height advantage... 

The circle closed all the way, we hopped off the roof, and finished up the last 2 squads (who were already kinda weak) for the W 😃😃😃... 

Im so fucking hype that my phone died while writing this and I lost it all, but I literally HAD to share this so I typed it all again 😂... 

Lucky (the horizons name), if you somehow see this, please confirm this story in the comments because I know no one is going to believe this shit 😭 and thank you bro! You are the fucking goat! Already told you that like 10x, but just gotta say it again! 🤣 Your name is very fitting because I would've never imagined I would beat TSM to get to masters rank...WHILE SOLO QUEUING...im still just in shock...

Edit: Also played a few lottery tickets for obvious reasons...(not joking 😂)...

Edit 2: Really this post is just to say, if you're having trouble with promos, and you're really fucking close to the rank you want, don't give up on yourself! YOU CAN DO IT!

Lol like I said it took me 50+ tries until I got lucky, so if you already put in the time and you want to rank up in the hardest season, just bang your head against the wall doing promos over and over and I promise eventually you'll get it...

It's torture tbh...getting so many 2nd and 3rd place games just to fail the promos...but once you get it, it's a high that makes every second worth it...

Edit 3: 🥲 toxic assholes are the reason I don't use this sub really at all...thnx alot guys...cant even be happy about a win...ive made 3 or 4 post in here EVER and now I'm clout chasing 😂 ok... ",apexlegends,1705568798.0,t3_199lym0

I understand the matchmaking is hot garbage and all, but this doesnt seem like it would be so hard to solve(tho obviously im not a programmer, so take this sentence with a grain of salt).

"How Apex Legends could be, better.","There’s a lot on my mind about the game and where it’s going. FPS or shooter games generally. My friends were the ones who got me into this game as good friends would do. I’ve been paying attention to this game not only playing it, but always viewing YouTube content and watching the pros play in tourneys and scrims. I recently joined Reddit. I’m not the best player in the game but I have a certain game knowledge by always devouring the info I see, going from trios to ranked usually getting platinum then to diamond. The characters I play are anybody really. I like Blood, Path, Gibby, Valk the most. The meta has been changing on and off since the characters keep getting newer and others more useful in different game modes. I remember when ranked had no shields and we had to find a white shield ourselves. I know this game has been under fire about the money they try and make and the way they handle the cheaters like most competitive game have been. Please make sure that you guys give me some feedback on why or why not my options and opinions matter to you if interested.

1. Dropping with a P2020 or mozam. (Ranked and competitive) enhance the loot rng

2. Dropping with a grey backpack. (Ranked and competitive) easier to loot up

3. Rank point system should be a loss in full points only if you die 20th. Getting a kill or placing 19th and above should be less of a point loss. Not just when you get 14th or 10th. Ranking points from tenth and so on should result in better points but not as much as getting the win. 2nd and 3rd points shouldn’t be close to a win.

4. Take off the demotion tries and negative point loss. Why lose half of your points and have to get tries before you demote. Just take away the amount we lost and derank normally.

5. The nerfing of some characters like wraiths ability to phase is slow. Makes her less viable and not balanced. Her animation needs a fast pace like ult. Path is the only one to get a cooldown and ult when looking at a care package. Rev is played as a skirmisher but was assault before. All those things make the game feel more of a choose to win then a play what you like. Seer is played way less often. Certain characters like conduits shield heal doesn’t prioritize who is weak but closest and is slow to do so on herself. Ballistic can’t cancel his ability. Mirage’s clone only walks but if he could go on zips or do other things it would make characters more interesting. Path would be cool if he could heal on his zip. Just weird suggestions really to make gameplay more fun. All these things are difficult to implement so I know it can’t always be that way.

6. Heat shields are two stack, should be one/Doesn’t have speed revive. Not in comp scene..one is all you need. 

7. Updates and bugs are still in the game. Everyone should have a job that takes care of those things accordingly and if you can’t fix ‘em tell the community why or when.

8. You can only rank with friends who are close rank to you. If this is for boosting factors I guess it makes sense.

9. Bronze and below should be matched up in the same lobbies. Silver and gold. Platinum and diamond.

10. Masters and preds need more incentive or reward. They need their own tier list even or add an extra high rank to have a challenging experience.

11. Skydive trails aren’t saved only banner icons. Why is that?

12. Trials was okay but having 1000 points just to get to the next level is not rewarding. Point system is. The higher the rank, the more points should have to be earned. Season splits or no season splits. Make it to where we can like to play it forever without changes. Then change it if gets stale. At least in my opinion.

With all that being said, it’s not enough. And the devs or whoever prolly won’t read this. Or listen to the actual people. Keep copy pasting gun nerfs and stick to event scheduling but atleast they could hire some people to buckle down on the cheaters.",apexlegends,1705525723.0,t3_1997tcz

I am tired of the MRB in Control,"Thee has been a lot of times where, the match is not bad, but also not good, and then this items drops, and on that point onwards, both teams are focused on getting the Mobile respawn beacon, and there are two outcomes when that happens:

1- The enemy team gets it and places it down on your spawn (Zones A or C), but they cant do anything

2- The enemy team gets it and places it down on your spawn (Zones A or C), and they domminate your whole team

I really don't like the thing about the MRB (Mobile respawn beacon) being on Control, i have enough stress when the bonus appears, so i think they should remove it, at least for me i don't think it belongs in Control

(The photo is from a match, where they deployed the MRB on my spawn and they couldn't do anything)

Nostalgia is gatekeeping your enjoyment,"A lot of people complain about the game, but the most common thing I've seen everyone mention is that ""it used to be better"" or the ""back in my day this and that"". It is probably true that maybe people who played in the early days dont like the vibe of the game anymore, but the game itself is in a much much MUCH better state than it ever was back in the early days.

I started playing again after a year long hiatus, since then SO MUCH has changed and for the BETTER. New maps, new modes, new legends, new QoL changes and my most favourite, CHANGING THE FIRING RANGE ITS SO GOOD NOW. This was a lot better than it was a year ago and im much more hyped to play again.

The game is in a really good spot for new players to come and enjoy and the people from like season 0 or the early days aren't complaining about the game being different but rather yall just miss the good times you had during that time. And thats whats stopping yall from enjoying it now. (We can all agree that old time apex was way more buggier than now)

So don't discourage the new players coming in because trust me, this is the best time to play with a lot of new content and even the event, i know its controversial, but they will be able experience a super cool ltm.

What nerfs have made you the saltiest? For me it’s removing Lifeline’s shield then adding Newcastle.

Another nerf I’m kind of salty about was removing Wraith’s Naruto run. Just like Lifeline’s shield they could have adjusted it but they removed it instead and now she only Naruto run in phase, when she’s immune to damage anyway.

I’m also kind of salty about Bangalore’s smoke being nerfed to stay for… 18 seconds instead of 23. Because it did nothing and she needs more nerfs. Why is she still able to deploy 2 smokes at a time? It’s actually so stupid.

Fan Creates Rework Ideas Pt. 2,"
Wraith - 
Wraith is one of the heaviest hitters in the Game's all-time meta but has a lack of use in the current meta outside of her insane repositioning ability. This insane repositioning gave Wraith a reputation before being nerfed to hell, so creating a new way to play Wraith would be ever so monumental to the game's state. Her new Ultimate would be grounded and give her a competitive edge, but a weakness. The ultimate I thought of is a dome of portals, she'll be thrown around a mess of portals, depending on the range of the dome (She can choose how far it reaches up to a limit,) would be her time to shot before her reentry. This would give a dicy, more thrilling edge without making Wraith a deciding powerhouse.
Ash -
Ash sucks, it's a definitive truth, despite this she can be worked on and by providing more creative, stealthy tactics rather then a weaker skirmisher with no utility will provide the 3 Ash mains some comfort.
Passive - 
Ash's passive is great, but isn't codependent on her kit in any way (isn't bad, just nonsensical,) so her passive should a jump boost to jump higher on walls. (This ties in with tact.)
Tactical -
Her old tactical sucks. So create a new one, ""Shroud,"" a device that sticks to walls and allows her to hide and spectate. 
Secondary Tactical - 
After Hiding in her shroud and viewing the enemies from the void, she will get a ""Phase Shuriken,"" that allows her on accurate throw to change places with the enemy for the remainder of the allotted time or until an enemy breaks it. 
Ultimate -

Turn kill cam and kill quip off,"DISCLAIMER: I wouldn’t want to take these features away from people who want them/enjoy them, but I cannot tell you how much I would like to be able to turn them off for ME.



Ok, so I am not good at this game, and I like to play just every now and then.

But beyond the crushing difficulty of matchmaking, I find kill quips and the new addition of the kill cam very frustrating and downright depressing.

Like I said, Im not good at this game, I die a lot.
Most times you die, you get the privilege of hearing a character tell you that you suck or that they are better than you. I ALREADY KNEW THAT.

It’s just like rubbing it in my face, and it makes me not want to play. 

Kill cam similarly, I know I suck and I know that I died, why rub it in my face?

I’m not going to git gud, Im not going to go enroll in Apex Academy so that I can get even more stressed out about this game, I just play FOR FUN.

And having people tell me I suck, and rubbing my nose in it because I get killed IS NOT FUN.

Once again I don’t want to take this away from people, but I wish I could turn it off for me.

And when I'm finally in a match, I sometimes only get 1 teammate instead of 2. Or I'm completely alone.

Pre-Made Matchmaking,"I am sure I am not the first to talk about this. But, 

  
**Why the hell can't we matchmake with predefined legend choices?**

It is so frustrating and time-consuming to always having to choose what legend to pick when you a MM with a premade squad. Like, I AM CHOOSING MY LEGND IN THE LOBBY! We all are!

And further down the line: **Why can't there just be a ""Replay"" Button on the Death Screen of a Teamwhipe when in a premade Squad?**

Always boom dead, quit to main menu, start MM, 1 min passes, Lobby found, 58/60 players, let's wait another 1 min just to then start the round with 58 players, great now let's choose our legends, another min passes, this is your squad! (no shit???) this is your champion!! (I DON'T CARE JUST LET ME PLAY THE GAME)

Should Loba be nerfed so she can’t grab heals and maybe shields with her ult?,"I main Wraith and Loba - they’re my 2 most played legends. Recently though with three strikes and because everyone has a lack of heals in that mode, I’ve become kind of frustrated with how scrubby people can be with Loba. Just using ult to steal all the batteries and evo shields in the area…Of course, the Loba is just doing what they’re supposed to be doing and providing loot/support and committing tax fraud. 

I do think it maybe is like genuinely unfair in a way though for the teams that are fighting and stuff like this can encourage ratting in ranked. It’s not like Loba is the sole cause for ratting or anything. Wraith, Horizon, Conduit are all played a lot more than she is, in all game modes. But just throwing Loba ult out, finding a God spot and then yanking evo shields from people fighting is absolutely something people do.

Nerfing her so she can’t grab heals would still give her and her ult a lot of utility. Thoughts?",apexlegends,1705504949.0,t3_198z0i4

"Conduit, Rev, and Stat Boosts","People have been talking about Conduit and her place in the game, and I think the interesting thing about her addition is the fact she came right after Rev Reborn. Both her and this new Rev have something no other Legend in the game has; a direct, uninterative stat boost.

There are plenty of stat boosts in the game, but all of them put emphasis on the action of the user. A speed boost, a handling improvement, a reload speed boost, none of those put up a ""wall"" that the other party hits against because the player with the stat boost pressed a button.

With Rev Reborn, there's a lot more interactivity with hitbox sizes and resets, but the point stands. Losing to Rev Reborn or a Conduit team because they ""just had more stats"" because they pressed a button is incredibly frustrating and uninteractive, in a way no other Legend is. The issue isn't that she heals, Lifeline heals and Wattson heals, the issue is that she offers a direct stat improvement that the opposing team can't do anything about.

I think this is worrying for the direction of abilities. Straight stat upgrades on a button press that the opponent is forced to break against is not healthy for any competitive game, it's too direct an advantage.",apexlegends,1705494588.0,t3_198vgl1

"To be honest, I was thinking about aim assist."," This is one idea, but wouldn't hip-fire aim assist be necessary? I think hip-fire aiming is difficult until you get used to it, whether it's keyboard mouse play or controller play. Also, if you play CS, you've probably experienced this at least once, but sometimes you get sucked in by an enemy you've knocked down, and your bullets don't hit the enemy the way you want. The aim is stuck to an enemy that is not the one you were aiming for. When performing flick operations, the hip-fired aim assist slows down the operation and causes the aim to point closer to you than you intended.  Aim assist is enabled only when aiming. How about introducing a system that allows you to switch, such as disabling aim assist only when shooting from the hip? ",apexlegends,1705479711.0,t3_198rqxl

My Patch Notes,"Before we start I want to mention I am trying to take in the fact of many factors like Competitive, casual and how to code/implement it.I am trying to buff weaker characters and overall trying to level the field.

Fuze:50% gernade resistance(no ultimates or abilities) 
Gives him more synergy and helps survivability

Ash:Ability to snare up to 2 people in one snare.Ult -30 sec and travel faster in phase.
The ability to snare 2 people would be a nice cc and making the ult up to par with wraith.

Ballistic:Passive swap time like if it had a blue stock, Weapon strafe speed in ult are reduce to a min of an AR,ex:LMG and snipers will have the same strafe speed as an AR and pistols and smg strafe speed will be inchaged.
It can give more variety to the ballistic and improve the feeling of using the ult.
 
Path:Passive to heal on zip, come on its a little obvious

Octane:If using tactical while reviving, 15% faster 
This may be big change but it will give Octane more of a team feel and playmaking ability.

Valk:Ult -30 sec  nothing big 

Crypto:Can ""Hack"" empty containers for extra mats +10 per. 
Crypto is a characters that preps so giving him this ability is not far off.

Seer:NO

Vantage:Tactical-echo will make a sound q signifying people near by. When person is hit with ult they do a sonar pulse every 2 second in a 8 meter radius,the scan works like old bloodhound scan.
These changes will make Vantage feel more rewarding and fit in her class.

Lifeline:tactical works like Newcastle tactical but slower,Ult only drop purple armor(no more blue armor)
Simple but effective changes to her kit.

Mirage:when bamboozled, .5 sec light arcstar stun(resets every second) and 5% damage intake for bamboozled effective duration.
Mirage's bamboozles never felt rewarding or punishing, I went with 5% damage intake over flat damage bc it would be annoying and not rewarding in higher level play.

Conduit:Tactical-space out the regeneration by 2 second
It's both a buff and nerf, you have it longer but less potent.

Loba:Passive-pinging shows items location ex:teammate pings ""I need sheilds"" it shows the shields with her passive. 1 pingable per person 
It could be hard to code in but This could be the push loba needs.

Caustic:tactical-deploy has 50 hp instead of 1 hp
Small buff to help him compete with the other controllers

Rampart: Tactical be able to through walls like caustic trap (can toggle off and on),Ult works like Vantage in 4 waves 
Rampart can be more active with these changes and be a aggressive as well.

Catalysts:Barricades without doors can be destroyed, have 200 hp 
This will tone back how annoying it is to fight against a catalysts.

If there anything you think should be changed Or can be added on, please let me know.",apexlegends,1705478079.0,t3_198rd6r

There needs to be a major rework for the control legends on Mixtape.,"Why is is it that these traps can stay up for the full length duration of a match where half of a team can easliy camp and be annoying. I don't have any legends that can counter them, it makes no sense. Make it so that their tacticals do not replinish on respawn, and have the traps sit on a timer. Its not tactical or strategic gameplay, its easy bs. Has anyone else seen how bad this is.

Maybe a few maps should be redesigned too IDK. Possibly limit how much a team can have (might not make sense) or add an ordinance to the game like a arc grenade from tf2 that disables them or can actually stun enemies.

No more of those fun late game situations because of… evac towers?,"I played about 5 games of ranked tonight, and maybe 5-10 the previous few days as a Diamond II. Probably 80% of the games had 15+ squads alive by the start of ring 3. 


Inevitably, this means that by the next ring I’m stuck with my solo q team hiding behind poor cover until another team can 30-30 us down. Sometimes we’re the team doing it, but regardless that’s not as fun. 


The fun part is beating a team 1 on 1, and that rarely seems to happen anymore. Either we swoop up an easy sweep or right when we’re winning another team starts taking pot shots. 


I wonder if the cause is because of evac towers. There’s no doubt it’s the most common survival item on the floor for some reason. Without evac towers, teams were forced to hold their ground in early ring 1 or 2 and rotators like path or valk or wraith were valuable for escaping. But now with evac towers everyone escapes every engagement, so then by ring 3 there’s 45 people alive. And now the support class is the most valuable class because if you don’t have an evac tower then you can craft",apexlegends,1705470324.0,t3_198pa0j

The recent brain-dead nerfs to weapons are a cancer that rigidifies the game. This must be rectified immediately.,"I am frustrated with the recent adjustments to SMG weapons, and it seems like the person responsible for these changes may not understand the concept of balance. The excessive weakening of R-99 and CAR is widely acknowledged, and I'd like to delve into the discussion using the SMG category as an example.

&#x200B;

In the same category, a strong contender is the Volt. The Volt's concept revolves around lower firepower and DPS but minimal recoil, providing versatility for mid-range coverage. In contrast, R-99 and CAR are specialized SMGs with high firepower compensated by challenging recoil.

&#x200B;

However, what is the current situation? Specialized SMGs cannot even compete with the Volt in terms of firepower, leading to a lack of incentive to choose them voluntarily. In other words, despite having multiple weapons, the practical choice is limited to using the Volt. The previously effective dynamic between specialized SMGs and versatile SMGs is disrupted. In some cases, adopting both types could have offered configurations excelling at close range while remaining effective at mid-range.

&#x200B;

But now, if one wishes to capitalize on both aspects, the only viable option is dual-wielding Volts. What is the appeal of such a scenario? Despite the existence of various weapon types in the SMG category, developers have stripped users of the opportunity to actively choose weapons, strategize, and have enforced a meta-game that aligns with their preferences, robbing users of the intended gaming experience.

&#x200B;

This trend is not limited to SMGs; it extends to the AR category as well. While introducing powerful new weapons adds freshness and excitement, the inexplicable decision to weaken the already well-balanced and stable R-301 upon introducing the Nemesis is baffling. There was absolutely no need to weaken the R-301 with the introduction of the Nemesis. I strongly advocate for an immediate return of the R-301 to its previous state.

&#x200B;

The intention to shift the meta is evident, but the forceful manner in which it is done often eliminates too many choices. Please consider carefully: what constitutes good balance in a game? In my opinion, it refers to a state where there is a balanced power dynamic among various elements within a certain range. Users should be able to strategically choose what they need from a variety of options, creating an ideal form. While making everything exactly the same is difficult, if strengths are concentrated within a certain range, a metagame develops, and users' tactics begin to shape the meta. This is the natural evolution the meta should take.

&#x200B;

I urge you to seriously reconsider this. I've expressed a lot, but recently, there seems to be a trend of making brain-dead nerfs to the meta, which feels quite absurd. Developers, please understand the game better and make adjustments that require thoughtful consideration. It appears there is a struggle with adjusting SMGs and shotguns recently, but I believe the key to resolving this lies in engagement distance. I hope for a balance adjustment that involves maneuvering in close and extremely close quarters.

&#x200B;

The recent updates continue to weaken the current meta weapons, frustrating me with the limited choices. While many express a desire for a 30-30 nerf in this thread, I believe it's essential to look at the root cause. The attempts to forcefully shift the meta with nerfs to G7, R-301, Nemesis, and Hemlok led to the prominence of the 30-30, which wasn't initially a highly-used weapon. As options were relentlessly reduced, more people are using it simply because there's nothing else. Continuing this adjustment path might lead to an increase in Triple Takes or Nemesis, resulting in more nerfs. What's the point of such a cycle? The current situation is the outcome of mindlessly nerfing weapons that had proven themselves as viable alternatives without balancing against others. It feels incredibly absurd.

&#x200B;

I hope for a more thoughtful and comprehensive adjustment in Season 20, rather than resorting to brain-dead nerfs.",apexlegends,1705449263.0,t3_198i1iq

I noticed this pattern a few days ago but today, I even bothered to spectate and in my face, I watch several teams rotate in a way to pinch the ""outsider"" and then they take turns looting and even while being in each others sights, they dont shoot each other. 

Several of those people I spectate rocking master and predator badges and its hilarious. Its hilarious I win most my 1s vs a pred or masters and cant get out of plat. And its hilarious Im watching some insane teaming.

Sure, it can happen randomly but the fact for 3 games straight I spectated people running together and wprking together in ranked. At this point, I strongly believe that more than half of the high ranked players are cheating, teaming and what not.

"Annoying Things In Apex, That Shouldn’t Be Annoying?","What are some things in the game that people do that most wouldn’t consider annoying that you can’t stand? I’ll start:

1. When my teammates have white shields, I ping a better shield and no one dibs it or picks it up.

2. When I play with randoms and it’s clear they know each other (from their group name) and I am the odd person out. I am sure they are on Discord and I can’t hear what they are saying but they don’t use in game pings to communicate with me.

3. When people relinquish jumpmaster and then make suggestions for where to land.

4. Related to number 1, when you ping an item for a teammate they pick it up and not say thanks.

5. When people don’t speak the entire game and then they turn on their mic at the end of the game to complain. Like why weren’t you communicating the WHOLE time?

I need help.,"Posting this from an alt account, for privacy reasons. I don't like to share anything like this, but at this point I need to ask for help. I've been playing this game for a while now, more specifically around 1500 hours of active playing. I got to somewhat of an average level pretty quickly, but any further improvement seems impossible. I don't need coaching or vod review, more like of a mental advice. I know how to play the game, yet I'm making the same mistakes over and over again. But more importantly, my mental state while playing a game is terrible. I'm becoming more and more frustrated, tilted, anxious, because of my neverending failure, and I'm playing worse and worse. At this point I believe that I just naturally suck balls at this game, and there's nothing I can do about it. Even when I take a break, It's all over again and again. I get on, play ok for a while, then I became terrible, rage quit because of it.
If any of you have ever experienced this, please tell me what to do cause I'm out of options, I feel like giving up entirely, maybe it's just not a game for me.

Idea(s) for S20.,"Here are a few things I think if Apex did in Season 20, that would retain and bring more/back players.

1- Legend Tokens. 

Lets make a use for these, any item in the store that is Epic or lower should be able to be bought with Legend Tokens, and Legendary should be crafting materials or apex coins.


2- Ranked ELO system.

Trials are by far the worst thing ever, especially for solo players. MMR is also awful because nobody (i think including respawn) knows how it works. Just make it a straight up Elo system with a leaderboard.


3- Star system.

Solo-queuing is terrible. Introduce a star system, so you know how others rate their teammates, and to combatant ""fake"" ratings, you can see how often the person who rated them rates other people.

EX- you can click on someone's star rating, and see their last 5-10, and click on the person who gave them that rating to see if they are just trolls or someone who actually rates.

Definitely my least favorite LTM.,"For reference, I have been playing apex since the second day it came out; I have played every mode that has come out - from the winter express (my favorite), scopes & scatter guns, Halloween mode, etc. My first problem with this mode, you cannot turn it off. I should absolutely have the option to play regular trios to avoid the shenanigans.
 On top of that, this mode is here for 3 weeks - way too long for it to be the only trios option (other than ranked, which has a broken point system imo.) 
Reason 3, the swords. A game with some of the best gunplay around has now subjected itself to a cheesy gimmick of a two-hit-wonder-weapon. I can wander into the open, block your bullets, then charge at you in half a second, launching you into the air and cracking your shield in one swipe. Bullets do not slow the swordsman either.
Reason 4, while I do enjoy some aspects of the materia upgrades, they are way too apparent in the game, and the nessies are an absolute pest. Easy to kill, but they inevitably respawn, and become nothing but aim bots - further ruining the integrity of the game.

I just had a game with 10 kills, but OH SORRY you didn't get Top5,  your squad died #6,  so doesn't count for the Promo Trial from Gold to Plat!

My suggestion is to make it like ALGS,  sort of. Once you enter Trials, every one of your Trial games is being counted. Points for Placement, Points for Kills etc.  You'll always do 3 Trial games and at the end of it, points from all 3 games are added up and you need to beat a certain threshhold to succeed the promo.

Promotion Games Arent That Bad,"It doesnt reset you to the beginning of a tier if you fail your promotion matches. It also gives you extra attempts after every fail. I.e. if you have 5 attempts and fail. The next time you get to your promotion you'll have 6 and so on.

So overall not as bad as I expected.

BUT after failing several times we should just be awarded the next rank up. We earn more LP than is necessary to rank up before trials were added. I dont see the point in having gained 100+ LP just to stay in the same rank.

This game has to stop getting in the way of itself,"I hope this isn't too repetitive of a post but I just want to join the rest of you guys in solidarity. 

Thought I'd enjoy a day off playing some Apex. After a few hours it was enough to observe why it wasn't enjoyable. The game simply gets in the way of itself. I don't think the game is stale, it just needs QOL improvements big time.

I warmed up with Mixtape for a bit...

1. I get legitimately unplayable stuttering on the Caustic treatment map only. So if that's in the rotation, have to find something else...
2. Wait for TDM, get a match where three of our six players finished with zero kills and 200-400 damage while the other team is full of 4k 20 bomb players averaging 2500 damage each.
3. Oh and Audio randomly gets completely muted and muffled now since the latest patch

Okay time to move on to Battle Royale, oh right, its a forced LTM. Get my 2 games worth of rewards points, dying to a sword in a few hits each time. Nice...  


Alright time to hit up my ONE friend that still plays this game and try and chill on ranked because no Trios...

I kid you not, three games in a row our random decided to afk rat in some corner the whole time because well, ratting is rewarded more than kills...

I love this game when everything goes right but as of late, there's no way to enjoy a longer session without being met with the same QOL issues time and time again.

Why can't snipers 1 shot to the head? I ask this because I came from games like BF or hyperscape (won't say cod since yeah no reason to aim for the head) now I'm not sure if it's because of the shields that prevent players to get the kill besides the red version of the sniper but I'm curious why the game won't allow such thing to happen?

Issues when playing in a party with my friend,"Hi all. Recently, I've started playing Apex on PC (I played it before on PS4 and switched to PC when cross-progression became available). I have this one friend I usually play with, and back when I played on PS4, we played with each other  without major issues. However, ever since I switched to PC, playing with him became almost impossible. Whenever I play in a party with him, I'd get kicked out of matches like 70-80% of the time (as in, I'd get kicked out either on the legend selection screen or right after that) and I can almost never rejoin the match. But when I play alone, I never encounter this issue and all my matches start properly with no notable issues. My friend is on PS4, if that helps

So, does anyone know how to fix this? And thanks in advance",apexlegends,1705349714.0,t3_197imee

The Buster Sword is NOT the problem in this LTM.,"The **fucking nessies**! holy crap. Fast, spastic, little aim bot shits.

Who thought it was ok to make clairvoyant enemy alert systems, that hunt down anyone within your half of the map and are able to climb literally anywhere. It is absolutely impossible to outplay them so you *have to* waste your ammo on them.

Not that it does any good. They'll just be back in 5 seconds.

If the enemy team has two of them, they deal serious damage. Forget about using a shield cell. There's a fucking nessie after you.

And who decided that they would attack downed players?! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? *Oh you want to find cover? Haha, sucks for you! I have a  thirst machine!*

At least the swords have to be actively used while putting yourself at risk. And good players can absolutely defend against them.
